You learn and live the Bushido code at all times.  All the other information posted here is good to know as well.  You must know the layout of the guild and how to advance in guild rank.  You should know what happens to those that break the code and what happens if you fail to advance the guild rank.  What objects you cannot use in sparring Pai Mei.  Follow the Bushido code and you cannot falter.  Never bring shame to the name of the Samurai.Valen, Emperor**stun/rend(vertebraker):**Stun and Rend no longer work in PK.**samurai(vertebraker):**samurai can't raise their stealth past 20..**iaijitsu/bladestorm(vertebraker):**I raised Bladestorm's cost to 80.Iaijitsu and Bladestorm now work off of magical damage.**kenjutsu(vertebraker):**Kenjutsu now hits with a "magical" damage type.**iaijitsu/bladestorm(vertebraker):**Iaijitsu and Bladestorm now function a bit differently...Not going to say what the change is, but it's not thatmassive.**Emperor's Note's(valen):**Shoguns:Every Shogun has proven they are mighty warriors and the Emperor will listen to them. Every Samurai will do the biddings of the Shoguns and Emperor.  There are no LT Shoguns and only one Emperor. If any issues should arise, then the Shoguns and Emperor should be mailed. If you attain the rank Shogun, then let me know.On Recruiting:The way of the Samurai is following the bushido code.  What we look for in a recruit is someone to follow the Bushido code without question.  The recruit will do the biddings of any Shogun and the Emperor.  All potential recruits for the Samurai must be level 15 from now on.  Once the Shoguns believe the recruit has what it takes, then the recruit will be invited into the Samurai.   The only way to get promoted to Samurai rank 1 is for the recruit to demonstrate his/her knowledge of the Bushido code and pass any trials given by the Shoguns and the Emperor.On PK:The greatest honor is to die in combat in service to the Bushido code.  Setting your pk to fight in battle is what very glorious Samurai desires.  The thrill of the fight and the experience of combat. Once you obtain the rank Shogun.  There is nothing holding you back!  It is strongly encourage to set your pk at this time and join the rest of the honorable Samurai in combat with the enemy.  If you die in combat and you lose all your gear, then find new gear and restore your honor by slaying your foes.  If you are jumped in combat and you are not ready for the fight, then leave and grab what you need to fight the enemies of the Samurai.  Nothing more glorious then dying in combat!On Clans:All Samurai are encouraged to join the Yamato Clan.  The Yamato Clan follows the same principles of the Bushido code.  The advantages are public coins and personal locker systems.  Also with public storage for anyone to take or put into.  If any member of the Yamato clan breaks the Bushido code.  Then let a Shogun or the Emperor know ASAP. For recruitment into the Yamato Clan ask a Shogun or the Emperor.Follow the Bushido Code and we cannot falter.Valen, The Emperor**Shame(valen):**I will shame anyone for thier actions that are not following the Bushido code.

In your offensive mode, you will nolonger get the defensive bonuses you still were getting before, andvice versa.  For any who feel this is bullshit, you need to understandthat from my point of view it is complete and total bullshit thatnobody was reporting how overpowered this guild was.  This guild had,before my tender affectionate attention to it, by FAR the most offense,indeed, significantly more than dervish.  On top of that, whereDervs have 0 defense at all, literally, this guild had the highestdefense in the game by far.  I can't see how anyone can't noticeexactly how bs that is.  Bullshit is a +22 running through the museumwith a minimal of heals time after time.  Bullshit is blowing throughshit like it's nothing and then complaining because someone catcheson and fixes it.  Bullshit is what I'm going to do to anyone gripingto me on this, because my patience is very very thin with this guildright now.-Earwax**26(vertebraker):**I removed the "self-cutting" chance on iaijitsu and bladestorm.Bladestorm costs 240 sp.

We aren't so much a "good" guild as we follow our own moralstandards and values, but I would prefer that we stay on good terms with Rangers and the KnightsTemplar, as like I said, myself and a few others are allied to one or both and I'd like to keepwhat allies we can, since the majority of guilds would rather see us fall as a guild than anythingelse. But, if you are to battle someone, yes, you bow first when you enter the room, and as youare doing battle, do so with pure honor and lack of any fear. I recommend reading 'shelp pk',as that's a somewhat solid file written by Vertebraker himself.

This has been fixed, although some of the nerfingremains.This means you'll likely find yourself doing more damage, but you'llalso take more damage in offensive stance, so be careful.It also means there are non-RP reasons for using traditional Japaneseweapons again, including Duncan MacLeod's katana.  You won't getthe sp heal, but there are other benfits to using it.Some of you had surely noticed that your stances didn't do much, and thatyou weren't getting any defensive emotes.  If something like this happensin the future, please don't feel you have to suffer in silence.  Send mea mudmail, or a tell if I'm not idle.**Hey(jaster):**Where is the Samurai Guild at? i have seen no one log in, no emperor, no servents. someone, let me know there is still hope for our guild!!!**Emperor(jaster):**I have Been Appointed Emperor.

In the dir /players/mizan/opl/generator are the tools i am currently coding/messing with to create the realm I am working on which is essentially just a giant, randomly generated maze.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/generate_maze.py is some Python code which currently is hardcoded to build 100 x 40 sized text mazes. The #'s are navigable areas, while the periods are no-man lands. It can be executed on a system with Python installed by invoking 'python generate_maze.py'.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/compile_maze.sh is just a little script that saves human-readable output of the maze to file, and also makes a copy which has no line breaks.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/process_maze.pl is then the perl code which actually builds up the .c room files which are all stored in /players/mizan/opl/CELLS. My code as usual is not formatted very cleanly because it's a work in progress. Essentially in this file, I read the output from compile_maze.sh, and iterate through all the rooms. I am basically counting exits- if I see dead ends, I randomly put a monster or something interesting in it. If I see intersections, I crowd them up with monsters that 'block' them. Things like that.  Additionally, here is something which may be of great interest to Verte. http://iceyboard.no-ip.org/dg/ This is an instant town generator, written in PHP. The code is available at http://iceyboard.no-ip.org/dg/?source=1  Also, a cave generator which I found lives inside /players/mizan/opl/generator/cave shows promise, it just needs some tweaks so that certain passages always remain 'open'.  I'm no expert on this stuff, it's been a bit of here and that tinkering for me so far. Go nuts. -tij  **illarion** Re:   do_special() and armor strikesCc: boltar,vertebraker,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,sparrow,angelDate: Feb 24 21:47Rather than simply blocking additional calls, what about making them less and less likely? First call always goes off, second is if(!random(3)), (33%), !random(6), !random(12), !random(24), etc **sparrow**Subj: BWO <thematic ideas>Date: Mar  2 01:20As you are aware of I am sure, I've been very slow on the Black Willow Order. There is a reason for that. I want to be very thorough with it. I envision a guild with the depth of Mythos' dark mages, that is the goal at least. He had a way to capture the imagination.  Idea for Basic Background of the Guild Each member of the Black Willow Order has established their own Parish in the Church of the Black Willow. They gain guild levels by a combination of tasks, experience, coins and parish membership. Tasks we won't worry about at this time. I was thinking that parish membership could be a very fun and competitive aspect. One way of gaining membership would be through battle. As a member fights, the more damage they give out as well as the more damage they receive, a crowd gathers to watch the fight (reason: the more entertaining, the more of a crowd). After the battle, a random number of the crowd (higher percentage as glev, which I'm calling renown at this time, rises) converts to the BWO. The member's guild abil power/economy rises and falls with the size of their parish. Parish size decreases with inactivity, and the number of crowd would be higher when fighting higher aligned mobs.  Coins - All BWO members must tithe. I haven't decided on a % but I am looking at around the 25% mark. Is there a way to catch money before it is added to the player? For example when money is picked up, gained from selling, received from other players? If so I think this would be a perfect time to enforce the tithe. Players use this base of coins to build their guild hall. Guild halls are unique to each member, kinda like the clan system now. The maximum size of the guildhall is limited by the parish size and renown (glev).  Each parish is connected to one another by underground tunnel system. BWO memebers can travel in any BWO church freely and hopefully this will entice players to build halls that compliment one another. It is going to be VERY expensive to add on, but I want to make sure that it is required to advance. Maybe  ghall size could be limited by Parish Size instead of the inverse. That would be a good way to make sure that they are building. They can add things such as storage rooms, lockers, healing mobs, practice rooms, weapon/armor smiths <- for the eventual armor/wep degradation. etc... Also I am going to come up with a few dozen (or more) prop objects that they can purpose that can add to different  aspects of their guild power. Sacrifical Altars for example might give bonuses for their tithe. Statues could add to the power of their healing mobs. Stuff like that.  Let me know what you think about the direction I'm going. I miss you! hahaha **angel**Subj: astaroth's entranceDate: Mar  5 14:48Hey, I didn't find anything strange, but a lot of errors. as a basic room it is missing  ::reset(arg) after reset (arg) { There is no / before  players/astaroth/junct the is no way from  /room/big_tree.c to get to this room there is a mising , after south in dest direction. It has no return 1 at the end of the code but before the last } and I would have put \n" at the end of the last line of the long_desc and not made it another line by itself but it works either way. Lastly there is not an items = section for descriptive words... **chip**Subj: HighlanderCc: sparrowDate: Mar  8 14:57Since when has it been ok for someone to have two player characters logged in at the same time, no matter what the reason? If someone cannot detach one of their characters from another enough to seem like a separate character to other people, then no one else should be forced to either. There is NO reason whatsoever that the exception should have been made for one person when we know goddamn well no one else could have had that same exception made for them. None at all. And, on that same note, if the decisions of two separate Emperors will just be overridden by a wizard who left them without and guild wiz at all for so long, what the hell's the point of having Emperors in the first place? Maybe it's just me but I think it's just fucked up people are being given blatent permission to go against the game rules just because they bitch and cry and can't get their way. Forget the fact they can't detach one character from another of their own enough to be believable as a fresh personality. Forget the fact one happens to have a wizard and the other does not. That's exactly what's going on. And we wonder why we've lost so many people to other games with a much better and more reliable structure?

Here's the entire story:  Heinous has been able to glean access on highlander's alt characters, I do not pretend to know how, that is neither here nor there. He had been using this information for the last few months to keep highlander from joining the sam's  with any character. This has been going on since before HL became a wiz. I had been warning Heinous that he needed to practice character seperation for the last three or four weeks. In the meantime I had been telling HL to focus on his area and give it time, that I would try to talk some sense into heinous. HL finished his area and put it up for approval. I'm assuming that he has been bored since then because the quest to gain a samurai had begun anew. He asked me if it would be alright if he logged in Kadaj with a new character just so he could chat on public channels to give the impression that it was not him. There was no equip/kills between the two characters. He spoke with Heinous and met the requirements to join the samurai. Afterwards I spoke with Heinous and informed him on what went on. All I wanted to show him was that HL could indeed create a character  that met his approval. I appologized to him for the  deception and I told him that he could do what he wanted with HL's character, he could remove him from the guild, he could let him fail on his own.  Maybe I was too tired, maybe I need to stay away from  players, none-the-less I made a bad decision. A lot of the time I am the only active wiz on, I get flooded with issues like this all of the time. Normally I tell those involved to forward it to Fred. Anyways I'm staying away from players from now on, I have too much work to do and too little time to do it. Vertebraker is only  involved because he backed me up after the fact. I try to be a good and fair admin, I go out of my way to make sure things run smoothly - this was not done to undermine the game itself, my intentions were fully disclosed. I understand that it is not my job to decide, or enforce for that matter, what is fair or right.  I accept full responsibility for this fiasco and await punishment. I just ask that I still have access to work on my projects. Ignorance is no excuse and I truly am sorry. I not only undermined my own authority but that of those that trusted me with this responibility. Sparrow **rumplemintz**Subj: Re: SparrowCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,mizanDate: Mar 11 10:10So, from what I gather, the 'crime' was that he revealed information to a player, that should only be known to wizards (if at all).  I'm not one that has ever been the 'sheriff', so I'm not going to claim to know what type of punishment should be handed out for this.  He does seem to realize what he has done, and admit it without question or lying/trying to hide it.

Since your lack of participation began, the project has strayed and I have added some lack-luster and cliche` abilities. I'm getting ready to gut it back to the core that we originally developed. I have a plan that I am going to  outline in the text documents.

I proposed this a long time ago, was approved in the large scale if I could get a functioning small scale example running to test, lets say limited to an area.  Take a look at : /players/sparrow/open/propDocs/economy.txt  IT is something that Nirvana needs badly, which will also require editing almost every standard file in the game. Want to have some fun then?  Also FYI the skill doc that Illarion is in that directory too. -S **sparrow**Subj: lost causeCc: (To: x) vertebrakerDate: Feb  5 01:56I need to know, are you trying to make nirvana into a viable game again that can compete in the market or are you slapping some smilely face band aids that'll give the two people that still log in a little fun. If it's the latter then by all means carry on. But trying to convert nirvana into a copetitive, modern mud is going to prove to be impossible. Just to implement an  economy would require everything to be rewritten.  I've been looking at mudlibs, I've pretty much setteled on dead souls as my base. I'm not going to try to sell it to you, I'm  not looking to compete with nirvy. But if you are interested in being a creative force behind something fresh then check out the lib and let me know. I love nirvy but she lost her  best feature, the people. They made the dizzyingly con- fusing unmappable areas, zero continuity, pathetic selection of good gear (everyone uses the same "best" shit), and shifted focus to the player run guilds. The flaws, although glaringly obvious became finsignificant next to the RP that dominated in the early 90s peaking during the guild wars. Large groups of players and a simple combat system was all that was needed. Then came what I feel is directly responsible for nirvys demise. Weak Ineffectual Administrators Player run muds work wonderfully as long as nothing under- mines the strictand simple power higherarchy. Jebuly is GC over Wulfgar because Jeb is 19+21(stupidest level structure) and wulf is 15. THis was ruined by letting any pervert that can read a cheat seat turn himself and his tiny penis into what is essentially a god on nirvana. Unrestricted and un- accountable wizzing then began endless cycles of guild pumping and nerfing, closing guild and losing players  until every guild was a generic swiss army knife clone that had everything a lone player could need. So if you want to be part of something epic let me know. Dead Souls 3 is just built right, complete, solid it just feels right. Yes there will be heavy modifications but I wont have to spend two years getting the areas to  load again because we had to update the driver to allow decimals...  anyways...you no dummy you get it... end rant **xero**Subj: Sparrow AccessCc: (To: boltar) fred,vertebrakerDate: Feb  8 16:21looks like my ip changed again could you get sparrow access please thanks Xero, Sparrow **chip**Subj: Mud reunion on Sunday Feb 17, 2013Cc: (To: boltar) fred,sparrow,mizan,rumplemintz,illarion,x,vertebraker,angelDate: Feb 10 12:15Shinshi has set up on facebook, a sort of reunion for all the Nirvanites we can get ahold of, both new and old, on Sunday, February 17th, 2013. On top of those whom he invited, I've invited close to 30 people myself, and hopefully they have more people they can invite as well. In light of this, and knowing I don't have that kind of access, we would like to request a couple of things from the administration, in hopes it will help bring life back to the mud. The first of those requests, is a significant increase, or even maybe removal, of the limit on the number of players that can be in a party. If even half of the people invited make it, there will be 15+ people on at one time, many of whom we can surely say would love to socially group together, definitely with more than 5 to a group. Or, as an alternative (I'm not sure how hard it would be to do by comparison), maybe make it so you can link groups together. Like, form 2 5-person parties, and link them so the channel and experience gains are linked between the groups. Without the social aspect of the mud, it won't go very far in the way of trying to bring it back from the dead, and this sort of thing would help incredibly. The other request is in regards to the alignment killing restriction of Power Rangers. Even if it's just for the reunion day, we would like to request this restriction be lifted, as I know for a fact several of the attendees will be playing their Ranger characters. With this restriction lifted, even if it is just for a day, it will help as far as not limiting where and what these groups (or hopefully, one really big group! lol) can go after. Rangers are generally limited to barely more than half of the mud's npcs, and this would take much of the fun from the reunion day's attentees, knowing they only have a small amount of stuff to do, then waiting for respawns and such. Lastly, this is more of a personal request, if there's anyone you all know, that we were unable to get ahold of to let know this reunion is happening, please take a moment to pass along word of the event, its date, and if they haven't been around since the address changed, the new one of course! Many thanks for the time and help in this from you all. This will hopefully be a day to remember of Nirvana's already colorful history! Hope to see you all there! Sincerely, Chip **boltar** Re:   Mud reunion on Sunday Feb 17, 2013Cc: (To: chip) fred,sparrow,mizan,rumplemintz,illarion,x,vertebraker,angelDate: Feb 11 09:08Paragraphs please.
