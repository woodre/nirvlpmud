In this step you will choose a race for your character. There are some minor
differences between the choices in attributes, but these can be overcome
later through advancement. Race exists as a cosmetic choice for many so
there is a custom option. Simply enter the word custom followed by what it
is you want to appear for your character's race. Custom races will  
recieve the same starting attributes as humans. The choices are
human, elf, dwarf, or custom <race>.
