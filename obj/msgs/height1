Now we move on to your character's height. Height is another physical 
characteristic that you may choose rather freely. There are some 
limitations on the upper and lower bounds due to race. Humans may be 
from 4'0" to 7'11" tall, elves from 3'0" to 5'11" tall, dwarfs from 3'0"
to 4'11" tall.

Height will chosen in two steps, first feet, then inches for the 
fractional portion. For those used to the metric system this may seem
confusing. In order to explain, one foot is equal to twelve inches. A 
foot is equal to 30.48 cm and an inch is equal to 2.54cm. So in this 
step, if a height of 168cm is desired, the entry would be 5, for 5 feet.
In the next step, 6, for 6 inches would be entered to make up for the
remainder. 5'6" is equal to 168cm.
