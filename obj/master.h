 * This file may be irrelevant in your setup if you follow exactly the
 * mudlib 2.4.5 directory conventions and:
 *     - don't want to give the wizard a default workroom
 *     - don't want all new castles to be moved to a particular room.
 * In this case, just make sure everything is commented out.
 *
 * All these defines are straight out of the config.h for the parser but
 * many are not used anymore particularly the ones below as create_wizard()
 * has been replaced by master_create_wizard() in master.c.
