 
Finally, the end of player creation. It shouldn't have been too bad.
You will be asked to approve your choices, if you want to change something
you'll need to start again at the begining. After approving the choices
you will be moved to the Adventurers' guild where you may further 
customize your character or simply begin to play. Good Luck.
