Welcome new player! 
We will now go through the player creation process. First we will
set you up with a password. Please try to pick something unique that
you do not use elsewhere and that other people will not be able to guess.
If you wish to abort this process, simply press return without entering
a password. Please pick a password that is at least six characters long.
