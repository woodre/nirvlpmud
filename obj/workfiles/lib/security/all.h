/* 08/17/06 Earwax: Removed, consolidated them into wiz_levels.h as
 * it's simply too irritating to look through 3 files to find out 
 * what friggin level something is.  Left the other files in as 
 * old files may refer to them, I WILL however eventually move this
 * to either /std or /sys.  I'm really sick of everything I need to
 * look up being divided into multiple files all over the place.
