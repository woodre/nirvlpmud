     The voting system is an automatic issue resolution system.
It is designed to minimize the hassle involved in resolving
player and various mud-related issues, while at the same time
providing a more democratic and documented approach.

     The voting system was designed to account for the fact that
players are not usually logged in all at once. Thus, the voting
system keeps track of vote tallies over the lifetime of a vote.
There are two types of votes: a vote in progress and an expired
vote. Votes in progress are those that can be voted on. Expired
votes have already run their course, and cannot be voted on.
Every vote has a time limit which determines whether the vote is
in progress or expired. This time limit is recorded in cdays
(short for "caucus days"). Cdays are equivalent to real days,
and are automatically decremented as days go by. When the last
cday of a vote has past, that vote is automatically closed and 
can no longer be voted upon. Results are auto-tallied and may
be viewed at any time. In fact, results may be viewed on any vote
at any time.

     The creator of a vote sets up what the choices for the vote
are. By default, the choices are 'yea' for yes, and 'nay' for no.
But, this can be customized to suit the needs for the individual
vote. For example, there could be 5 distinct choices. When a vote
is tallied, the numbers of votes casted for each choice are added.

     In addition, the voting system allows the votes of certain
voters to carry more weight than the votes of others. The voting
system code is easily customizable through include files, which
allows easy do-it-yourself customization without needing to surf
through tons of code.

_____________________Voting Commands___________________
votes
     Displays the current votes in progress.

voters
     Displays a list of those who have voting authority.
     Without voting authority, a player can only view the results
     of votes. No vote creation nor casting of votes is allowed.

vote_help
     Shows this help file.

vote_results <voteName>
     If <voteName> is not specified, shows all the votes that
     have been created... referenced by voteName (a name that
     uniquely identifies a vote).
     If <voteName> is specified, shows the results for that vote.
     Note that if a vote is still in progress, more results may
     come in at a later time.

vote_create <issueName> [secret|open] <cdays> <choices> <issueDescription>
     Creates a new vote.
     <issueName> should be a short one-word ID name for your vote.
     Specify 'secret' if you wish to hide the identities of those
     who vote on your issue (the name "Someone" will appear instead).
     The issueDescription is your chance to explain the issue.

vote_close <voteName>
     Use this to close a vote about an issue that you have
     created. A vote that is closed ends prematurely, and results
     are tallied up and saved. The results can be viewed with the
     'vote_results' command. Closing a vote is useful if you do
     not wish to wait the whole time limit to gather votes
     (i.e. you could hold a 5-minute vote). Remember that you can
     only close your own vote. Office election votes cannot be closed.

vote_cast <voteName> <decision>
     This is how someone actually casts their vote.
     If you created the vote, don't forget to cast your vote.

vote_cancel <voteName>
     Cancels a vote in progress. Note that votes that have
     already closed cannot be canceled.
     You must have created the vote to cancel it.
