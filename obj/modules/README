These are modules for inheriting into other objects so that you don't have
to recode the core functions we use in all objects.  These will move into
/basic at some point as they get tested and approved.

Note: These are LP/Amylaar compatible.  Newer versions for LD driver are
already in basic, do not overwrite or use the newer versions with the old
driver - they won't work.
