not trying to pull one over on you I am not the stupid

'he's disappearing fast :(

You tell Malik: ok. you're not getting the point.

You tell Malik: You abused a cheat. That's it

You tell Malik: If you would have stopped lying, I wouldn't have even jailed you
r first character

You tell Malik: But you persisted

You tell Malik: Therefore you got a slap

e lying to me and insulting me

it cause it makes sense rfor it to be that way

I'm resolving an issue

->> Malik tells you: large but subtle difference

You tell Malik: And I considered it resolved when I gave you a minor punishment 
and told you to report the bug

->> Malik tells you: resolving it incorrectly though

You tell Malik: But now we are STILL wasting time over it.

You tell Malik: Not only am I on a power trip, but everyone else who I have spoken
to about this MUST be a liar, in your eyes

You tell Malik: and sorry, if I am going to make a wrong choice, it will be with
 the most facts? So, if you want to chalk it up to unfair, I don't really care.

->> Malik tells you: time done wasting, and if doing your job as a wiz is too
much of a job for you to handle then why are you a wiz if
you are just going to find the easy way out every time?

You tell Malik: I don't even know what you're saying

You tell Malik: Just shut up and play, or quit. Those are your options

You tell Malik: If you find a bug, report it

You tell Malik: That's all I asked
