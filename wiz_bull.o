new_head "Player Recruit Strategy"
new_text "Through interviews with players, and being a player myself, I've developed a player recruitment/retention strategy, with some key points as follows:1. E-mail campaign, utilizing the emails we have attatched to players2. Create a more robust social media presence3. Player Events (Guild war, capture the flag, mud mob invasion, in game RP events)4. Create incentives to vote on game websites5. Recruit players on game forums, providing a structured reward system for referals6. Rewards for logging in multiple days in a row (ac/wc boosts, items etc.)7. Promote mobile gaming8. Prestige expansionThose are just a few ideas for now that may be beneficial. Let me know what y'all think.-Xiao"

tmp_text "Type 'wizhelp' for wizard help files.Mail Wren for updates and general maintenance.				verte**It has come to my attention that Elysium's new life has been comingfrom the nirvana wizard and player base. I am extremely unhappy about this.As you know, it has been proven and admitted by key developers ofelysium that their base code was stolen from Nirvana. It also obviousto any casual observer that they have stolen much in the way of thewizard lib as well. Elysium was started using the code stolen fromthe classic guild project of Nirvana.The princple adminstration of elysium as their opening celebrationslandered me and acted to damage this mud by sending spam through themud mail system.I thought this was all behind us. Yet I now learn that variouswizards have once again been spreading false rumors to create dis-satisfactionwith Nirvana and bring people to elysium. Suddenly our login numbersare way down, and elysium has new life.I have also found out that nirvana's wizards have once again beenrecruited for elysium. That code from here is flowing to elysium.That these wizards are also coding new stuff for elysium while neglectingnirvana.It appears that those of you who are doing this, and it is a largenumber of the active wizard and player base are voting reflex. I haveno idea why.I have always been fair, just, and allow what is really unheard ofcoding freedom for nearly 14 years. Sure I'll stomp on the sword ofmonster-desting or such, but just about everything else goes.If the wizard base here wants reflex over me, that is your decision.However, keep in mind that elysium sucks it's life force from nirvana.Without nirvana it would not exist. Without the people from here itdies. Conversely, if too much is sucked out of nirvana, Nirvana willdie.If you want to kill nirvana, keep helping reflex. I find this defection,done behind my back, without so much as one item of dis satisfactionbrought to my attention, to be very personal. It says to me that evenafter all these years I haven't even earned to the right to correctwhatever it is that isn't liked. That all my efforts to run a free,fair, and honest mud have gone for naught.I don't want to make a rule banning elysium wizards from here. But itis clear that I am being pushed in that direction. If you want to livein reflex world, I just may give you that wish. I cannot compete withreflex as I will not lie and steal code. I will not spread false rumors.I cannot compete and refuse to compete on that level. If this means Nirvanadies, so be it.I feel insulted and sadened as I have given people free choice and theyhave chosen against me despite knowing the real story. To those just 'hedgingtheir bets' by playing both sides, you're a bunch of chicken shits.To those that have been supportive the last two years, I thank you. I knowwho my real friends are.**There's a new room to the west with a new board for discussing wizard ideas.Have at it.**I have grown tired of your collective actions. It appears that as a group, you have no respect for me. You pass information to reflexworld. You pass code to reflex world.You build on reflex world first. Since you do not respect me, why should I continue to respect you?Why should I continue to be good to you, allow you to be a wizard here, allow you to keep your levels when your loyalites lay elsewhere? When you are willing to harm Nirvana, and through it me, for the benefitof others? I think over the years I've done alot to earn people's respect. How have you earned mine? Showing me you care more for reflexworld than Nirvana is not showing me respect. In fact, it's flipping me the bird. If you actually care aboutbeing a wizard here, you should seek to rectify that. **It appears that a conversation I had with Kazer is being used by reflex as a recruitment tool. He is spinning it as giving my blessing to his mud which I refer to as assium. The conversation was nothing of the sort.First, it was to be between me and kazer, without reflex. It seems thatkazer betrayed my wishes in that regard. second, we were discussing kazer starting a fresh mud, not a new lib forassium. Reflex is stating that it is a new lib for assium, not a new mud.So either kazer or reflex lied to me as both cannot be true. third, kazer promised that no nirvana code would be used on this new mudof his. Only some stuff that was fresh on assium would be carried over. Now it appears all of assium will be carried over and assium will not be closing. My offer to help kazer was based on my general offer of helping people starting fresh muds of their own. If this is not the case no help willbe given. No blessings or anything else. Assium runs my code, without my permission. It does so to this veryday. How do I know this? It's my code, there's alot of it, they'll never be able to purge it without starting fresh. I've see it with my own eyesand seen my comments, my variable names, my code. Code I wrote a decadeago or more. If someone tries to recruit you from there, do not take this conversation as my blessing, it is not. It was a conditional conversationand it appears the conditions will not be met. In fact, I now feel itwas designed specifically to dupe me into saying the things I have alwayssaid wrt new muds being started from scratch.**if players have problems with each other and require wizintervention [or if they have problems with wizes],please tell them to talk to Stardream, asthis takes the load off our backs as wizards andpromotes unity of policy. If they persist thatthe problem be fixed now, please attempt to deal withit and update Stardream as to the situation.In addition, if Stardream asks you questions in regardsto a particular player or wizard problem please answerher as fully as possible as you would any player affairswizard. As all player affairs wizards are effectivelyinactive, she has stepped up to the plate.love, Dr. V**There is now a board 1 down from the Advance Hall that you can post notes on of changes that you maketo mobs/items that are in the game.  The board is totry to keep players informed of changes so all of asudden a regular mob doesn't block exits, or an itemno longer has a certain function.  It is up to the individual wiz to decide if the change warrants beingposted.  Naturally things such as changin/adding color,fixing a typo, or things that players shouldn't know anyway like adding 1 to the ac or lowering a wc ideashould not be posted.Thanks Fakir for the suggestion of the board :)Fred***** NEWS FLASH ***VERTEBRAKER THE JANITOR HAS COMPLETED HIS BI-ANNUALCLEANING DUTIES OF THIS BULLETIN BOARD.Please review /doc/build/RULES ,                   /doc/build/notes ,                 and /doc/notes    as this is a most EXCELLENT time to do so :)*** END FLASH - YOU MAY RETURN TO IDLING, FORBIN *****DO NOT EDIT .o FILES THEY WILL CRASH THE MUD.IT MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH STRING LENGTHS.YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO MANIPULATE VALUES.**Do not restore a player's guild object if you do not knowwtf you are doing. Have them type 'guild_object'.If it does not work, help them get in touch with theirguild wizard or a higher level wizard who knows howto restore their gob. Fiddling around with it causeserrors as Bolts has pointed out before.**I constructed a new prison, still located in/room/prison.The commands are the same, the arguments are slightlytweaked:'imprison <who> <days>' :  Imprison a player for a certain number of days.  You do not need to supply a reason now. There will be a system for tracking player problems later.  The prison will automatically release the player now  after the amount of days that you have specified.'free <who>' :  Free a player from prison.  This will start a cycle wherein when the player logs  in, he will be released from jail. If he is already  present, it will suck him in..Ooh, one thing I forgot to mention. "imprison" also works pending login. You can now jail people when they are logged off for infractions they have committed.There are a few extra commands in /room/prison,you should take a look at it.Do not forget that you can only release the playersthat you have jailed. You must contact Stardream inorder to bail out appeals -- she is the warden.**updated /doc/build/dtype.cats with"sonic" dam type**if you have to delete from an array, you maywant to consider the new sfun i've written, a_delete()the code is in /obj/simul_efun/a_delete.cessentially the -= operator will delete the firstrecord of whatever element you are deleting, evenif you would want it to delete the second or thirdor whatever. this can cause big problems in lists.a_delete() makes sure that it deletes the exactelement that you want.syntax is:   mixed *str;  str = a_delete(int i, str);**New armor types:bracelet, cloak, chest, necklace, earring, gloves, pants, beltPlayers may now wear 2 "ring"s.They may also wear two earrings.Please update your items, such as "misc" armors which mayfall into these categories, or "ring" armors that may nowfall into the gloves category. Thanks.**Need someone to start indexing areas/guilds forthe /open/info project.Check out /open/info/README for more information.All areas need directions on how to get there,[or at least approximations]All guilds need information on how to join.**Enough.If you're a wizard and you're going to talk trashto players, sit around and bitch all day, thenit's time to reconsider whether you want to be a wizardor not.It's time once again to read wiz_behaviorand realize that you are supposed to be an EXAMPLEto players. AS YOUR PLAYER CHARACTERS AND AS YOURWIZARD, THERE IS NO SEPARATION.IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTING IN FOSTERING A POSITIVEATMOSPHERE AND REBUILDING THE MUD AND SEEK ONLYTO DENIGRATE AND DESTROY OUR EFFORTS, THEN YOU WILLFIND YOURSELF DEMOTED.ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.PLAYERS CAN BITCH. YOU CANNOT.**Hogath has been dewizzed for the following infractions[1] Continuing to incite a hostile atmosphere against wizards    by players by talking trash about us when he didn't like    us or our decisions.[2] Spamming idea/bug logs with how much he doesn't like my    code or the recent changes I've made.[3] Passing completely classified wizard information to players,    i.e. giving TRANSCRIPTS of the wizard line to WORM of all    people.and the final straw [4]  Cheating blatantly on the mud for absolutely no reason,  even more stupid cheating in front of other wizards who  were online.It seems obvious he would rather be a player than a wizardat this point or he would have stopped this behavior, but letthis be a lesson to everyone else to watch themselves. Wizardsget no more rights than players do; it's your duty to be socialand honest, but don't let it get out of hand. And as wizards, ifyou DO play, you already have FAR more powers than the players do,you don't need to CHEAT to prove how dominant your other charactersare over theirs, they're completely weak compared to our charactersbecause they don't have the knowledge. This kind of behavior willcontinue to be punished.again, there is no separation between your wizard char and yourplayer char, you are expected to act as a Wizard at all times interms of how you would deal with players [no cheating, etc.]Finally, I did not make this decision alone, it was made via Seniordecision based on who was online at the time, so don't go thinkingI am some megalomaniac [that is besides the point].**Please, please, please....pay attention to note number 16 folks.Vertebraker didn't type it cause he likes to read his own words,just like I am not writing this cause I like mine.  It's time tostart acting like wizards, or you'll no longer be wizards.  Thisgoes especially if you are level 30 and below, cause you obviouslyhaven't proved squat yet.  So quit chirping on public channels(muffle them if you have to), and get coding.  And while your areais in approval - you could always code something else!**If you're changing a mob's weapon_class or armor_class,do not do weapon_class += 5; or whateverdo set_wc(query_wc() + 5);set_wc() uses the correct RegisterWeapon() stuff forexample to set the proper values and calculate the correctrxp... etc.addition: I fixed the bug in the lib that would cause   set_wc() / set_ac() objs to screw with calculating the   worth of the critter, i.e. Mondar jacking up from 600k  value to 1.5 mil**tallos has continually decided to badmouth the wizardadministration here... we have spoken to hi timeand time again and he has failed to change his ways...as such he has been dewizzed.. constant flapping and lyig....talking trash about other wizards... will NOT be acceptable if you area wiz. PLAYERS are afforded these rights because they are the lifebloodof the game. WE do not receive any special treatment, especiallyif we decide to bite the hands that feed us. You don't have to loveeveryone you work with. YOU MUST RESPECT THEM AND THEIR AUTHORITY.As the mud regains more and more players, this nonsense willnot be tolerated by anyone.**need someone else to take over organizing help files**ii'll take a crack at it if no one else is interested.**I've called in Jara and Khrell and a long talk with the bothof them about the code in the Knights Templar guild and withand administrative decisions made therein. I have full faithin their ability to handle the task and think they should beallowed to continue to improve the guild.Larisa will continue to work as a Guild Commander in and/forthe guild, though they are both to consider finding a personto fill that role in the future to avoid any conflict withinthe ranks that might be considered because of her developingthe code that is used in the guild.Switching to a player-run guild is going to be a hard, braveand difficult decision, but one that has great potential forimproving the guild overall.If there are any developers who have characters in the guildthey need to know they are NOT ALLOWED to fume and/or fuss &foment disagreement. If you want to be a player, that can bearranged.Vital**I will go along with Vital's descision concerningthe current condition of said guild, but it isunder scrutiny and if any bullshit goes on againit will be changed...pending a senior wizard review.Any power trips, favoritism, or wizared/player infopassing will not be tollerated.  Wizards talk to playersapply sphere players...wizards talk to wizards as wizards...if you get my drift.**mosobp is backas a wiz ..**/doc/cedit still contains files on crimson editor.I updated the nirvStyle.txt doc slightlyto add "auto-detection" stuff.**Unless you are a Senior or higher level, do nothandle player or wizard disputes yourself.In the case of a player dispute,refer them to Player Affairs [currently Stardream].In the case of a wizard dispute,refer them to the Administration[actively Fred, Vital, Vertebraker or Francesco]If a case arises where you must deal with asituation immediately, i.e. obvious cheating,continued harrassment .. warn the party andimmediately notify the appropriate department.If you had to take a certain action, notify theappropriate department AND note it in your workreport.No one else, especially not BOLTAR is to be involvedin petty squabbling.**For those that are interested, the following commandhas been added to your repertoire:  efunIt can be used alone: 'efun' for a listing of most current efunsIt can also be used with the name of an efun:  efun <efun_name> for more information about that efun.Thank you and happy coding.Vital**Roanan != Thomas.They're on the same network.**As per the post on the green, housing is ready.If anyone would like to make a room (or rooms) in their area land(in other words, allowing it to be sold, and a home to be built onit - basically an object added to it), see the sample room in:/players/earwax/housing/sample_room.c or the rooms in my area,or Fred's that he's so graciously converted already :).  My areais in /players/earwax/area/fields/room/.  To convert a room intoland all that needs to be done basically is adding inheritance to/players/earwax/housing/land.c and setting the cost of the land, size (indicating whether it can support a hut, house, palace, etc),and the name of the area it's in (ie, Fallen Lands, or somethingelse descriptive.  To see what the listings look like, goto/players/earwax/housing/realty.c, which is where players will bebuying these pieces of land.Any questions, feel free to mudmail or talk to me when I'm on andnot idle :)-Earwax**Effective immediately developers need to shift from using yourown versions of ansi.h to the standard one for the mud. Thisis a fairly simple fix of changing any #include statement withansi.h in them to just:#include "/obj/ansi.h"The administration will be going through and checking to seeif there are any extra ansi.h. If you have custom escape codesin your own ansi.h, consider submitting them for inclusion inthe /obj/ansi.h to help yourself and others.Thank you,Vital**I closed my area cause someone is just fucking with meI don't need the fucken aggrivation in my life and I don't wanna deal with shit I didn't have to deal with in highschool.  I may have not been theideal fucken wizard but at least I cared about thisplace and now thats even fucken ruined.**That doesn't make any sense to me. you'll have to better formulate notes if I am to do anything about it.**testing**A few Observations since I have been back.Major props to Gnar for revitalizing the base and giving players adesire including myself to play again.  Mizan's Overpower area is verycool but it is really focusing players to goto the guilds that have notbeen nerfed down for political reasons and players are really only playingRangers and Mages with a few exceptions.  I have also heard talk of other wizards making 'overpowered' areas as I am still not sure the first one isnot ending up just being an xp farm for some people is this going to be okto do in the future of nirvana in a normal area for other Wizards or is it an  for Mizan?  My next question is why has the power level of two weapons in thegame become a step above all other weapons to the point those are the only twoweapons players use at high levels?  Fred approved changes to the Finely HonedLongsword and as it is written very well at +65 it is a much better weapon than anyother weapon in the game right now from a play stand point.  The other weapon isGordie Howes Stick, now both of these weapons are part of Nirvana 'Lore' if you willand Gordie Howes Stick has Been Nerfed and apparently has been unnerfed but this isa game where we have Diaper energy bar heals, Milkshake Heals and Splooge Heals thediverse list gos on and on and when players only used one heal wizards nerfed that one heal.  My solution isn't to Nerf those weapons but to allow weapons that are at least onpar with The Honed sword and the Stick.  I have been on the receiving end of some Nerfingof a weapon of 7 and Fred uses the Elemental Weapon as the Gold Standard but in all Honestythat weapon is not as good as the other two and it should be.  Standards are always basedon who is interpreting the rules on a given day, one day this is allowed one day this isn't.Can we find maybe 3 or 4 other weapons accross nirvana that have been 'Lore' worthy at somepoint in time, Duncan Mcclouds Sword, Iron Death Blade, Elemental Weapon, Mace of Disruption,Nyx (Ice Dagger Forbidden Forrest) Just to name a few.Just my two cents on the subject I may go away but I always tend to find my way backJareel**Sorry the last not was a little jumbled.  I probably should have made a draft but I think I want to keep it unedited and true to what I really think.  If it is hard to follow tell me and I will rewrite it as it is very off the top of my head.**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
