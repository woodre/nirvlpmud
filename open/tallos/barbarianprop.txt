Guild Proposal
Barbarians
By
Tallos

Over View
The barbarians are a weapon based guild  that uses only hps and has no use of power or spell points. Through a “combat mode” known as barbarian rage they gain increased sta, str, and loss ac, ste and charisma. The barbarians weapon training and guild levels affect their overall damage vs. mobs. Weapon damage is enhanced while wielding the trained type of weapon, effectively doubling the Weapon class damage per round of the weapon at the highest guild level. The few combat spells that the barbarians have are subtracted directly from hit points, giving extra damage and effects, but endangering the barbarian by lowering his hit points during combat.

Guild Entrance
Characters must be at least level 10 with at least 20 strength, and at least 20 stamina, and be at least 10 hours old. Entrance can be achieved by any guildless character with the above prerequisites at the guild master in my main area of ravens bluff at the temple of tempest. Barbarians have no guild hall, save the temple of tempest which all characters can enter. The one guild room within the temple can also be accessed by any character, regardless of guild or level.

Rage Mode- the primary attack form of the barbarian. This mode lasts 25 mins and increases strength by guild level, sta by guild level x 2, weapon damage and hit %, reduces AC, ste reduced by 20 (Min 1), cha reduced by 20 (min 1), and grants extra swings on a random basis based on guild level check_guild level > random (40) = bonus swing.


Reckless Abandon- The only attack ‘spell’ of the barbarian it costs 10 hps per level of abandon which raises at each odd guild level, maxing at 50 hps per use at guild level 9. The spell does abandon level x 5 + random (abandon level squared).


Honor the Dead- A reclaim corpse spell that costs nothing and heals hps based on corpse level.


Battle Cry- This ability grants the other members of a barbarian’s party a bonus to hit and damage for a short duration based on guild level. This ability costs 40 hps. The duration increases in heartbeats as guild level increases.


Blood Rage- The barbarian gains a bonus to damage based on 50%, 25%, and 10% hps total compared to max. He deals more damage when under 50% life, even more under 25%, and even more under 10% health.


Berserker Mode- This mode is similar to Rage mode only the bonuses are increased for damage and strength. AC is further decreased. It lasts 25 mins.



Drawbacks
Barbarians cannot use wimpy mode.

Barbarians cannot use mud spells, or any item that produces a spell effect.

Barbarians have a % chance to refuse to leave combat, when engaged. The barbarian will receive a message if they attempt to leave if the attempt fails. This % to fail when leaving combat goes down, dependant on guild level. Roll 20 + guild level > random (50) succeeds in leaving combat.

Barbarians cannot have a mini guild.

Barbarians cannot use a shield, helmet, or heavy main armors

Barbarians cannot use weapons classified as Misc,bows,guns,or crossbows. Only Swords, Maces/clubs, spears/tridents, daggers/knives, Staves, and Axes
