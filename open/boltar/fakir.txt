NOTE: I have made all the changes Maledicta recommended and re-proof read
      the rooms and items.  I believe the area is ready to put into play.
                                          Thank you,
                                           Fakir
      P.S.  I appreciate the time your taking to approve this.  I know you
            don't usually do this.  


     The area is a group of 49 rooms total, all with random exits to any of the 
49 rooms.  The exit function is tied to a simple add_action and the command to 
move from room to room is "travel".
     The ways were a gift, given to the Ogier by the male Aies Sedi.  Built by 
the 'One Power' and the use of magic, they were once used extensivly to speed 
travel from place to place.  Over time, and due in part to the evil influence
of the Dark One, the Ways became tainted and diseased, growing unreliable for
travel, and dangerous due to the ever increasing evil from within.  Because 
the Ways are a living thing, rather than an object or structure, this disease
has progressed over time.  In this age of the Wheel, the Ways are very dangerous
and filled with evil.
     I have attempted to create a large variety of evil inhabitants for the area,
and also provide some interesting types of gear for players to use.  Some of the
items found in the ways are filled with magic, and it is the magic which powers
the items.  If the player does not read or use the items with care, they will be
of little use to them for long.  Many of the monsters have been created with a
variety of random stats to vary the killing experience.  
     Most of the monsters in the area are aggressive...or set on a delayed aggressive
attack. (Thank you mythos)  Some of the rooms have up to three aggressive monsters.
This is thematic for the most part, as the Ways are used by the Dark One to move
his troops through.  The risk of death for a player in the ways should be fairly
high, due to the aggressive monsters, and the lack of available exits to safety.
The only exits from the area are 'Waygates', and of the 48 rooms, only 3 have a 
Waygate.  Of the 48 rooms, 25 are empty of monsters....however, they contain an
invisible emoting monster to provide color and atmosphere.  It is set on a very 
low chat cycle.
     Some highlights of the area:
1)  Machin Shin, the Black Wind, is a very hard monster, and roams the area at
    will, even if in battle.  He is aggressive on initial contact.  He will also
    be extreemly hard to kill, as he leaves the battle at will and has to be
    found again in the random rooms.
2)  Some of the armors and one of the weapons is coded to be usable only once
    by a single player.  They are good while the magic lasts.
3)  Deceiver.c is a monster that 'grows' once it is attacked.  The attacker
    does not get the treasure if they kill the smaller version...which would
    be possible if they used calms.
4)  Eyeless.c has a very nice weapon, a lance, which is dependent upon a pie stat
    and also alignment.  It is also a one time use only weapon, so it is a bit 
    above average and will serve well untill it breaks  or is unwielded.
5)  The signs in each room serve no current purpose, but will in the future, as
    they will provide guides for an eventual quest I have planned.  Two more
    areas are needed to complete the quest sequence.
6)  /WEP/blade.c may be a good weapon, but I doubt many will use it much, as
    it has appearence of a poor weapon and is of low value.  Only by actually
    using it for a time will it show its worth....
7)  Most of the monsters have been coded with some sort of spell damage to
    add some variety to the battle....and increase monster power.
8)  It is thematic that the rooms be so standard and with little change.  I 
    have attempted to highlight the area by creating interesting monsters
    with a bit of color and background.
9)  Rather than just give coins, many of the monsters will have a purse of some sort, 
    or give an item, or an object which will contain coins. (/OBJ/flesh.c)
10) I have created a large variety of Trollocs, with varied treasure items.
    Each will carry/give a different type of treasure/armor/weapon. 
11) There are twenty different, unique monsters created for this area.
