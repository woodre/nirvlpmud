Prison Terms
10-24-97 -Bp

A character may find himself in prison if he harrasses other
players (outside of game based hunting, pking, etc), harrasses wizards,
is a general nusience, spaming, etc and so forth.
Prison terms will be determined by the imprisoning wiz and boltar.
Minimum sentances are as follows:


1st offense:  1 week
2nd offense:  1 month
3rd offense:  3 months
4th offense:  1 year
5th offense:  life or banishment

These are MINIMUM sentances. The severity may be increased due to the
nature of the offense, past history, or simply the players attitude.
While the 3rd offense is listed at 3 months, it is likely that most
players who will likely have gone through numerous warnings will
More: (line 21)
end up with the life/banishment sentance.

Appeals must have good grounds and be submited to Boltar.

->> help multiple
Multiple characters  5-21-96 Bp
added pass through and leave behinds 10-3-97 Bp

There is one simple rule, if you have more than one character they MUST
be TOTALLY SEPARATE. Sharing of equipment, money, and anything else is
NOT allowed. if both players are on at the same time one will be removed,
wizard/god's choice.

Leaving behind money or objects for a second to pick up or
to pass money through a third player, pet or monster is not legal and will
be considered multiplaying.

Also, there will be NO character sharing, give-aways, etc.
If this is done the transfered character will be placed on inactive status
until its disposition is decided.
There are many reasons for this.
1> more than one character loged in at a time IS CHEATING
2> it is against good and honest mudding practice.
3> it takes up extra login slots that can be used by others.
4> it takes up extra cpu time that could be used by others.
More: (line 21)

The honest player should be offended by such behavior.

IN SUMMATION, ONE LOGIN PER PERSON.
