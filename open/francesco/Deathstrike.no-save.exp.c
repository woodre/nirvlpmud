This is Cosmo's log of gained exp for said period

the meaning of the previous log is:

Deathstrike logged in with the said exp, solved several go players games 
and gained some exp that didnt save when she logged off.


Then i logged in a test char, i solved one go player game and logged off:
the gained exp was regularly saved.

I dont know if it is a bug or what.
