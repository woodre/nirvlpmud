First and foremost, Thanks for your inquiry.  I think this project can be fun for everyone on the mud including the wizards involved.  Teamwork is fun and quite rewarding.   

Heres the details on the theatre:

    1.  I prefer that you code it as a true area.   Based on the movie you choose.
    2.  Minimum of 10 rooms.  I would like to see more rooms then that...but its up to you.  The exit to your area should be set for /players/dreamspeakr/CASTLE/c125.c
    3.  Once you choose your area "movie" let me know the name you choose, and what level you will be focusing on so i can put a rating on it.  Also this will assure that no one else will be taking your movie.  
    4.  I would like the opportunity to check out the area before putting the link in for the theatre.  
    5.  Although there are no deadlines, i am looking for a couple of areas to link up in the next couple of weeks.  The theatre will be located in my city in the clouds, which i hope to open in the next couple of weeks.  
    6.  Try and pick a movie that goes along with the rating that will be placed.  Here is a guideline for the ratings: 
        G=General audiance = levels 1-8
        PG=Parental guidence = levels 8-13
        R = Restricted = levels 14-19
        XXX = Adults only = 19 Plus levels only.
        In other words, if your coding the wizard of oz....we wouldnt want it to be XXX.  laff...
     7. The area will remain in your directory and your property.  Your name will be on the marquet showing you as the director of it.
     8.  The player will enter the theatre, choose a movie to go to .. and actually enter your area.  So your first room should be coded accordingly.  I suggest you work the area as close as you can to the way the movie is in rl.  In other words Dorothy and todoo wouldnt be in the castle of oz in the first room you enter. 
     9.  This will be a rocking place for the players.  I have not set any kind of limit on how many movies we will show.  So the possibilities are open.  :)

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions lemme know!  And thanks for your interest. There is listing at the end of this note that list all of the movies already spoken for.  If you see that you would like to join us in this effort, just mail me with the name of your chosen movie.
