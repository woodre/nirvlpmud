Club Fed Path: /players/tristian/realms/ClubFed
Club Fed is a mid level area that is more trying to force player interaction
with my stuff than for actual flavor.  It will be added on in my High Level area 
which will be a SuperMax prison.  For now there are 15 monsters, some good heals
with drawbacks too, prison money system that must be converted on way out...
