I got an indexing on illegal type error the first time I tried to goto 
Cell_A_03, A_05, A_07, A_08, B_02, B_05, B_07, B_08, and B_09.  When I 
popped into them the second time it showed me no desc and no exits.


ROOMS

In the cells..
    Window desc - seems a little awkward..  maybe try just 'A full
        double hung window that is bolted shut and covered with bars.'
    Bed desc -    Its -> It's
    Bathroom desc - bathroom, the door -> bathroom.  The door


court
A court room, with the judges bench, the jury box and two tables
for you, the defendant, and the prosecutor.  <- Not a sentence actually, 
so you ought to rephrase that some.
I fully admit to sucking with commas, dashes, and the like..  but I think 
maybe dashes after plea, and no_contest..


joey_cell
Short desc needs a space between Cell and in
Take out the comma after must be

parole
A panel of three people sit -> people sits


OBJ

eightball
tin foil wraped -> tinfoil-wrapped


MOBS

Tim Dinduse
He had milked a -> He milked a

Oscar Schmidt
Take out the comma after man
Typo at the end of the first line in desc..  ton -> to

Marty Roe
embezelling -> embezzling
He had made off with -> He made off with

Jack Spillane

tattoo's -> tattoos
