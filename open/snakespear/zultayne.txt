This is the help info for my first realm.
   Zultayne, the Gargoyle Stronghold

My realm is almost all Non-Teleport.  It's made for players under level 15.
There is a check in place that will move a player that is over level 14 to
a room with a nasty monster. The monster must be killed for a player to exit.

I used alot of randomness in my monters.  The min for that level of
 monster is the base, with the random going over that.

These are the monsters: (r=random)

Kunzite            15r2     10     24r3    350r50       875
Malachite          15r2     10     24r3    350r50       875
King               20       21     30      600r100      5500
Ruby               17       14     24      450r50       950
Sugilite           15r2     10r4   24r3    350r50       875
Zircon             15r2     10r4   24r3    350r50       875
Teacher            20       30     35      950          2500


There is only one weapon in my area. 
  Scepter of Zultayne

wc 18, storeable, return of 4 with a 1/3 chance of getting the return.
weight 4, value 1300


The King has the weapon and is hard to find.  I have several hidden exits
located through out the realm and a player will have to use several to get
to the king.  Also realize that the player killing the King will be level 14
or under, so I feel that is a good sized monster and will prove a descent
little challenge.  

The Teacher is placed in a room that only players that don't heed the warning
that I have made explicit and very clear.  The Teacher must be killed, in 
order for the player to exit the room.
