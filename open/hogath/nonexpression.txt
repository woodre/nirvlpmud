Illarion tells you: Okay, I'm going to try to explain this one more time. 
You have a wizard char.  Therefore, you are no longer entitled to just bitch.
 Either do something that will result in the problem being fixed, or remain
silent.

Illarion tells you: I strongly prefer the first option, of course.

Yeah you can express your opinion here, as long as you do it how Illarion wants you to
when he wants you too.  yay nirvana!

Maybe if i had been saying something no one else has said i would be able to understand
his comments to me.  As it stands right now tho, it doesn't seem like very many returning
people are sticking around....I wonder why?  I know it's wrong to draw a conclusion based
on little to no evidence *cough mizan* but hey, I just want to be like the mud heroes Illarion
and Mizan :).  yay me!
