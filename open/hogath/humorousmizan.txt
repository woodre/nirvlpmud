Invis) Mizan wizs: how's the elysium coding coming, hogath

(Invis) Hogath wizs: i don't have a wiz on elysium

(Invis) Hogath wizs: are you refering to entrer perhaps?

(Invis) Hogath wizs: entreri?
->> (Invis) Mizan wizs: sure

(Invis) Hogath wizs: that's worm

(Invis) Hogath wizs: i made the char her to taunt him
->> (Invis) Mizan wizs: Interesting.

(Invis) Hogath wizs: yeah, it was fun for a while

(Invis) Hogath wizs: used to get a lot of tells meant for him when i was
playing entreri

(Invis) Hogath wizs: was always interesting when i told them i wasn't him

(Invis) Mizan wizs: so you're telling me that entreri on there is now worm

(Invis) Hogath wizs: as far as i know it's always been worm

(Invis) Hogath wizs: course, since we both have lafayette ip addresses, it
could look like it's me
->> (Invis) Mizan wizs: you might want to tell this to boltar.
Illarion wizs: what, he has bellsouth dsl as well?

(Invis) Hogath wizs: why?

(Invis) Hogath wizs: yup

(Invis) Hogath wizs: he lives in this city
->> (Invis) Mizan wizs: because there's some confusion that you are also an
elysium wiz.
Illarion wizs: pity he didn't get it when I was still working for tech
support

(Invis) Hogath wizs: yeah, i figured that out already
(Invis) Mizan wizs: i for one am responsible, since i spotted 'entreri' on
there and i think i mentioned it to a few other wizzes.

(Invis) Hogath wizs: figured that out too

(wiz) (invis) Hogath winks

(Invis) Hogath wizs: i'll mail him
mail boltar
Subject: fyi
Give message.  Finish message with '**', or '~q' to cancel

I just find it amusing when people do what they accuse me of ;)
Oh yeah, I also like how I'm the one who needs to mail Boltar to correct MIZAN's
misinformation.....isn't it interesting how that works. :)

Hogath a wild and squirrely guy

******A FEW DAYS LATER :)
Invis) Mizan wizs: and on another random note. First time picked up on
snoop today that Worm admitted who his wiz char on assium is.
Bigbadaban ( player 1 ) has entered the game.
(Invis) Mizan wizs: entreri@assium. So i apologize to hogath for assuming
that entreri on there was entreri/hogath on here
wiz ok
(Invis) Hogath wizs: ok
->> wiz is cool ;)
(Invis) Hogath wizs: is cool ;)
->> (Invis) Mizan wizs: worm again, as bigbadaban

So maybe Mizan isn't quite the socipath i thought he was :).

Hogath
