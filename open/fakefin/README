  NOTICE--
This directory is for fake fingers for players.
For a fake finger to show up in the player cmd
you must first banish the name.  Second you then
request for boltar to add that name to the
"/bin/_finger.c".  After that you need to have 
a file in this directory of the banished name
with a .fin extention.  Players will then
see what ever is in that file when they finger
the banished name.  As this is an open directory
please do not touch the files that are not 
created by yourself.
