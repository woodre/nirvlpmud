   Unsane's realm is a realm of hellish monsters, fascinating
    creatures, sinners, wretches, and even gods.  Slay
    the three-headed dog Cerberus - Fend off the god of wealth -
    Duel with the terrible harpies.  But know that if you
    don't, you are to end up in some plane - some circle
    within this hellish existence yourself.

 *BONUS: Storm through Professor X's Mansion in the Comic Book within.

  The realm is recommended for mid-high levels generally, but as
   with most areas, some monsters are exempt from this rule and
              fall under a newbie category.

    Find the "hooded man" in the plains 4w, and 1n from the green.
    Ask him to try his handiwork on you.
