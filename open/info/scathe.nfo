  One of the older areas of Nirvana, this multi-level
  cavern still provides players of all levels with a 
  wide range of monsters to fight.

  For the newbies there are the Dopples, a very
  whiney bunch who just won't shut up.

  Deeper in the cave are the monks and the draks.
  While they are intended for mid-level players,
  tread carefully, for they can be quite dangerous.

  At the bottom of the cave are the most challenging
  monsters of the cave.  You have been warned.
