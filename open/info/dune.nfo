D        The Lothlorien Oracle is an ancient and troubled
U        land. The simple animals of the land, such as rabbits,
N        birds, and crabs can provide challenges for low-level players
E        However, in dark corners and forgotten temples, you may find
         more challenging monsters. If you are in search of a quest,
         find Amerasu and tell her you can help.

D        In Lothlorien, there exists a huge green tower.
U        Atop this tower resides the four Elemental Lords.

E        And for those players who are in search of a true
         challenge, seek and destroy Omni. But be warned,
         only the most powerful players can fight Omni and
         hope to survive... for there is no running away.
