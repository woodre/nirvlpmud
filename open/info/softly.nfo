[2;37;0m	Nearly deserted today, Rocky Point was once the home to
	 an essential lighthouse.  The mystery deepens if you
	 search the deserted area.  Take care in the lighthouse
	 itself though.  Ghosts of ancient pirates roam there.
	  For mid to high levels, with something for everyone.

[33m     Town of Algiers (pop. 621) 
[2;37;0m	A dusty town hides south of the forest.  Beyond the church
	 and fortune teller lie shops to delight and surprise.  The
	 variety shop is stocked with toys while the used clothing
	 store has new stock daily.  An herb shop oddly enough sells
	 voodoo dolls.  And if you happen upon the cock fights, look
	 for Fish so that you can place a wager.
	 There is truly something for everyone in Algiers.
