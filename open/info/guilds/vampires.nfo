One of the oldest, continually active guilds on Nirvana, the Vampires have maintained strict bloodlines and have honed their skills to near perfection. They are the undead minions of the night and are closely bound by the familial ties of kinship that can be traced back through ancient and immortal bloodlines.

The ranks of "The Family" are tight and admission is a slow, sometimes torturous and deadly process. The vampire guild has a unique guild hall that is utterly closed to the outside world and offers them a place of dark safety. The guild members abhor light as it is dangerous and damaging to them.

Players seeking admission to the guild must first post an application on the Vampire Bulletin Board. Give your note some thought. They want to know why you desire to join them and what you bring to the Family. Thay care not about your current stats but more about who you are. Many have been rejected because their note did not ring true to their ears
