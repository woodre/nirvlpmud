  <The Mages Guild of Nirvana -- Est. 11/95>
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      The guild promotes the role-playing atmopshere of the classic
Magic-User class.  A Mage believes that ultimate power is the
only true goal in life and that goal can only be achieved through
the relentless pursuit of Magic.
