The "open info" project:                   [5.31.02]

Originally this was Pathfinder's idea.  He wanted a way for players to get
information about the areas easily.  I guess he wasn't able to pull it off
though, or it simply wasn't maintained.  When I saw it over two years ago
I thought it was a great idea, and so I tried to drum up support for it.
Not many wizards cared though, so it just sat around for 2 years.  Now that
I have clout and Verte is on the scene, it's in the game.

How does this work?

/open/info/room.c is the only actual code for this.  The room is linked
to the west of the Adventurer's guild.  Each .nfo file in /open/info
is information a player can see, based on the wizard's name.  So if you
want players to know about YOUR area, all you have to do is crank out
a text file, name it yourname.nfo, and copy it to /open/info.  If you
would prefer to add color, you'll need to do it via a write_file().

eg:  write_file("/players/zeus/test", RED+"Zeus' MidLevel Area\n"+NORM+
                                      "intended for highlevel players.\n");

Two good things to include in your description:
  1. where your area is
  2. who your area is intended for

Obviously since this is in /open there is a certain amount of trust
involved.  Please don't change other wizard's descriptions of their
areas.  Please don't erase files.  It'll just mean I have to change the
system to something like the PLAN's where every wiz has their description
in their own directory.  I know we can avoid that.  We're all nice people.

If you have any questions or comments let me know.
