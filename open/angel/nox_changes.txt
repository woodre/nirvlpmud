GENERAL NOTES

Ok..  to start with, I love the idea..  It's a great show.  I'm doing this at work and I'm not 
sure if I have the monster docs on my laptop.  I think I do, but I don't feel like looking right 
now..  laff.  You've been around, so you know there's a document out there with monster guidelines.
I'm assuming you know these are within the guidelines, and if you didn't check, please do before 
you put it in..  *8)
Check over all the rooms and capitalize the short descs.
And one more general note..  any time I noted to add an item desc for path or paths, if you 
mention any footprints on the path, add the desc for those as well.  Before you do though, 
check my note for f06 about the footprints desc.  Also, if I missed any places to add one for 
path, the general idea is to put it into any room where the word path is in the long desc..  *8)
And you're going to have to deal with my overly happy notes and observatons and smilies this 
time around cos I'm in a very good mood, and as I type this I see them sneaking in all over the 
place..  laff

ROOMS

entrance.c
In the long desc, I think the third sentance would sound better as "It is rumored that many 
different races of Nox actually inhabit the various parts of this forest and are usually..."
In the items:
The one to exa trees ought to have a plural description too..  "Giant redwood trees.." and I 
think both of those would sound better if the comma was replaced with the word "that"..  
IE: "A giant redwood tree that looks to be.."
The one for footprints..  there is no mention of footprints in the long desc or in the other 
items so no one would ever know they are there to look at them.
For forest..  Capitalize the first word of it even if it's not a complete sentance.  I never 
harp on item descs being full sentances, cos it's not a big thing, but it still looks nicer 
with a capital letter..  likely cos we're all used to the first thing we read having one..  *8)
Add an item desc for shrubs.

f01.c
For the long desc, the third sentance makes it look like the water is doing the peering..  *8)
Maybe "The water appears to be relatively clear and looks at least five feet deep"
In the items:
For stream, capitalize the desc
For trees and tree, same thing as in the entrance
Add a desc for water, which of course can be the same as for stream
You may also want to add one for boat, that says there is no boat there, in case some player 
looks in the hope of finding one.

f02.c
In the long desc, the second sentance, "side" -> "sides"
In the items:
Same thing for the tree descs
For the bird descs, the first sentance is singular and the second is plural.  Since the 
items are singular nouns, maybe the second sentance would be better as "It also has.. "
For the tell_room..  I'm not familier with them, but I'm guessing that Fenri is the name of 
the species and not the bird's name..  so it should be "A Fenri flies in."  This one goes 
for all the other rooms that clone Fenri also.

f03.c
In the long desc, first sentance..  "so the going is not.."
In the items:
Same thing for the trees, and the one for the plural has an A in front of it this time..  drop 
that..  *8)

f04.c
I missed doing a "more" on this one when I was making my log, so I don't have a copy of it here 
at work.  Check it for some of the same stuff I found in others like it, the tree thing especially,
and don't worry about it..  I may think to look at it later, but likely won't.  All the rooms are 
pretty much similar so it's no big thing..  *8)  If it does happen to be a special one, or is 
really different in some way, let me know and I'll look at it.

f05.c
In this long desc I would usually yell at you for assuming a player would jump, since we should 
never put things in a desc assuming what they'd do..  but I like it, so leave it there.. *8)  
It kinda adds some variety and interest.  *shrug*  Just keep it in mind for other things, cos 
stuff like "As you look down into the well.." is supposed to be a no-no..  since we have no idea 
if someone would bother to look..  laff.  This one works for me cos almost anyone would jump if 
they heard that in a quiet forest.
In the items:
The trees thing again
For animal, capitalize it..  but to keep with the mysterious and kinda scary feeling of hearing 
something and jumping out of your skin, maybe write a bit more..  something like..  "Whatever 
may be lurking around, it can't be seen right now."  *8)
Add a desc for path and paths..  something simple would work just fine.

f06.c
In the long desc, since the footprints have never been mentioned in a long desc to this point, 
it would be better to end the first sentance after "heavy use" and start a new one that says, 
"There are footprints here of an unknown origin."
In the items:
The trees thing again.
Add a desc for shrubs.
Add a desc for path.
Maybe the desc for trees should be a little different since these ones are thinner and smaller.  
They might not appear to be as old.
For footprints, capitalize the beginning of it, and maybe add something more descriptive about 
them if you know from the show.  Approximate size, how many toes..  if they don't wear shoes.

f07.c
No changes for this long desc..  *8)
In the items:
The trees again
For branch, capitalize "one".
If I was writing this I'd be a smart-butt and add one for limb, since it's in the desc for branch..
and make the limb one say "One branch in the tree".  But that's just me bein a goof..  Do it if ya
want, but it's not needed..  *8)
For vine, capitalize "A", and I think maybe "A long, rope-like plant.." is a better way to say it.
Add one for shrubs.
Add one for path.

f08.c
No changes for this long desc.  For future reference they should be at least 4 lines long, but 
I'm in a good mood and I'll concede it's not always easy to come up with that much about a plain 
old room..  *8)
In items:
Add path
The trees again

f09.c
In the long desc, either "Listening, anyone can.." or "Anyone listening can.."
In the items:
Capitalize "There is none."
The trees thing again
Add path

f10.c
In the long desc, "small, shallow pool"
In the items:
Capitalize the first word in all the item descs
For opening, "It looks as.."
Trees again
Add one for path

f11.c
No changes to this long desc
In the items:
Capitalize the desc for trail
Trees again

f12.c
No changes to this long desc again..  *8)
In the items:
Capitalize all the descs
For ladder..  "wood and boards.  You could.."
For platform..  service = surface
And the trees again
And add one for path
In the add_action:
I can't think of a single reason anyone might try to "climb ancient" when there's a ladder there.  
Also, if all of the trees are ancient, it doesn't really answer the question of which tree they're 
climbing.  It doesn't hurt anything to leave it there, but I'd suggest that when they succeed the 
message should read, "You climb the ladder." since that's really what it is that they're climbing.

hut.c
In the long desc:
"a couple of mats"
"made from items within.."
In the items:
Capitalize the descs
Add "It" to the beginning of the desc for table.
For chairs, "there" should be "they're"
For chair, add "It" in the beginning

NPCS

anteaus.c
In his long desc, comma after Lya.
Hmm..  In his fist spell..  swings his fist in your head doesn't seem right since it's not inside 
someone's head..  maybe, "swings his fist, hitting you directly in the head"

fenri.c
Ok..  this is one weird lookin bird..  *8)
In the long desc:
Add a comma after "wide" and after "bird" and add the word "it" before "can"..  I hope that makes 
sense to you..  laff

lya.c
In the long desc, add a comma after Anteaus.
I'm guessing the Tollans are a race or a family..  if it's actually a person's name, take out "the" 
from in front of it.  But if it is a race or family it's fine as it is.
nafrayu.c
In the long desc, I don't know what the Nox's ritual of life is, but I doubt an outsider can tell 
by looking that he was revived by it.  Maybe put instead something about how big he is.  And maybe 
also his family ties like the others.  I know no one can tell that either, but I've left it slide 
mostly cos if someone was exploring and talking to the people they might find that out easily enough, 
and also cos there's very little to describe an invisible person with..  *8)
ohper.c
In his long desc, "Ohper is the oldest of this Nox family (432 years old)."  Or you might want to 
add his age in a separate sentance.  "He is.. "  But as it is it doesn't make much grammatical 
sense..  *8)
In the first load_chat, make it two sentances.

And last but not least..
OBJ

boots.c
I only have one question about this one..  looks to me like the lines making it impossible for 
players to pick up are commented out.  I'm kinda half laughingly thinking that it needed done 
when you were coding it so you could clone them to have a look..  laff.  Don't forget to make 
that work before you put it in game..  *8)
