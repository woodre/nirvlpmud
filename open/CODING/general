If you haven't read monsterX, then please do so now.
If all the concepts in monster3 and monster3.exp are clear to you, then you
should understand how that method can be applied to weapons, armors, and
other items based on drivers in /obj.
A few notes about heart_beat, etc.
heart_beat is a function that is called every 2 seconds or so. Mostly, the 
things that have it are monsters, players, kids, pets, etc. Living things.
However, every once in a while you code something that needs a 
delay, or something that needs to do something else on a regular basis.
And although the temptation to put it on heart_beat is great, you SHOULD NOT
DO THAT. heart_beat lags the mud bigtime if too many things are on it. There
is a controlable, much more efficient method of doing things on a 
delay basis: call_out (and remove_call_out).
As of this writing, there is an example of call_out in /open/wizardchild/call_out.c
Simply clone that, then read it. Even using call_out on a 1 second delay is more efficient than heart_beat,
primarily because heart_beat is 'global' and call_out is 'local'.
