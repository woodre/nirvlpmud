The following is the 'common' structure of a room. Note that you do not have
to write your rooms this way, but there are definite advantages to doing so.

inherit "room/room";    /* inherit the room driver */
reset(arg) {      /* called on object clone, and about every 2 hours */
                  /* on clone, arg = 0, otherwise arg = 1 */
  if(arg) return ;   /* don't change anything unless this is first reset */
  set_light(1);     /* creates light source - remove this line for darkness */
  short_desc = "A room"; /* seen on who, etc w/ exits */
  long_desc = "This is a long description. It can be wrapped around\n"
             +"a line like this.\n";   /* seen when a player looks */
  dest_dir  =
  ({            /* assign the array that holds destinations */
  "room/church", "church",    /* notice filename first, then addresable name */
  "room/shop", "shop"     /* notice no commaa at end */
  });  /* end of assignment */
  /* down here you would clone any objects 
   * for monsters, if you want them to come back before reboot, then you
   * would clone them BEFORE the 'if(arg) return ;' line
  */
  move_object(clone_object("/players/joebob/monstersthing"), this_object());
}
