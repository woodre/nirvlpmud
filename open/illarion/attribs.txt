Attribute Change Proposal:

First, I'd like to propose two new attribs, Charisma and Dexterity.

Charisma is, of course a measure of a player's physical attractiveness
and force of personality, and Dexterity, how quickly and deftly they're
able to move.  

Second, a change in how attribs are set at creation.  Currently players
start with all attributes at 8.  In the past, the elf and dwarf race
customized them slightly, but I'm proposing the the player instead be
allowed to customize them, on a point-based system, with the following rules:
    - minimum attribute at creation is 5.
    - maximum attribute at creation is 10.
    - total of all attributes at creation is 80, or an average of 8.

Third, a change in the rules for raising attributes.  The current practice
among players is to stop at level 5 and max all the attribs, or at least
the 'important' ones.  Since players then tend to enter guilds with maximum
stats, it's tough to make attribs actually mean anything to guild powers.
To change that, I'm proposing that players only be allowed to raise 5
attributes per level, including level 1, and that their attributes also
have an upper limit based on their level.  This makes for two rules:
    - total of all attributes cannot be higher than 80+(level*5)
    - no attribute can be higher than level+10
These limitations would be applied when the player attempted to raise stats-
players already past the limit would be prevented from raising stats
until they met the level requirements, but not otherwise inconvenienced.

Fourth, I'd like to propose raising the maximum attribute value to 30 for
all of them. This will allow players more opportunity to customize attribs
to their playing style and to their guild.  This will mean that players can
get all stats to 30 no earlier than level 44(19+23), but they could get one
or two stats to 30 at level 20.

Fifth, a higher stat limit means we need a cost for those stats:
          new stat level   cost per pt.
            -------         --------
             6-7              1700
             8-10             2200
             11-12            3300
             13-14            3800
             15-16            5066
             17-18            6000
             19-20            8000
             21-23            12000
             24-26            20000
             27-29            28000
             30               35000

Finally, and most importantly, I hope that stats will continue to be used in
guilds and for other checks, and, with them hopefully meaning more because
of the above, used more often.
