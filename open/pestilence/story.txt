    A long, long time ago on the island of Cahara there lived a dark
priest.  He went by the name 'Daragor'.  Deep within the island
Daragor found some mystic secrets hidden by the ancient demons
that once haunted the island.  
    Deep inside the core of the island, Daragor lived, devoting
his life to mastering the secrets he found.  Darkness grew
within Daragor's soul, making him secluded, yet very powerful.
Within the darkness Daragor was able to draw strength.  He 
learned there was many spells to learn, aswell as becoming
stronger in physical combat.
    Near the end of Daragor's life, there was a great
earthquake that shook his land.  Rocks fell, caves collapsed,
and he was trapped for what he thought was eternity.  Feeling
the fear of death, he cast a spell of freezing upon himself,
causing him to be frozen alive, in the hopes someone would find
him.
    Then one day, a great wizard named Pestilence had come upon
this island.  Using his great powers, he sensed a life form,
and it was then, he found Daragor.  Pestilence quickly revived
Daragor, but Daragor was in very bad shape.  Just before he
died, he shared his dark secrets with Pestilence.
