~~~CyberNet Image>> Puppy_ROARS
~~~Puppy@CyberNet>> IT'S CALLED i am possibly going to be sending spam over the damn cyber channel   next time i will just do it and scare the hell outta people instead of thinking of the people who use this guild and trying to be nice
~~~Puppy@CyberNet>> and as for snooping    usually people who are doing something wrong worry about that and the people who don't do anything wrong don't worry about it
~~~CyberNet Image>> Korwrath_chuckles and hands puppy a dried pig's ear.
~~~Demonic@CyberNet>> well i used the up key and enter to buy mass heals really fast so 1 i did nothing wrong and 2 if i am being snooped or was there was no grounds
~~~Demonic@CyberNet>> 3 its invasion of privacy when not doing anything wrong
~~~Kaynine@CyberNet>> 1 i can not snoop
~~~Puppy@CyberNet>> 2 if i were to have said magic object for the snooping of demonic i wouldn't use it because i am trying to do something construuctive
~~~Mizan@CyberNet>> lets make something perfectly clear
~~~Demonic@CyberNet>> 1 i did not point the finger at you
~~~Puppy@CyberNet>> 3 i REALLY hate when people do not have all the facts and start pissing and moaning about things they know nothing about
