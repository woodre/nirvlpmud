You open the door and enter your room.
You stand in one of the many identical guest rooms in the
Casa de Nirvana Hotel. (#281) Muted beige walls accented
with a paisley cranberry and hunter green border compliment the
rich shades of the Persian rug covering the polished hardwood
floor. To one side of the room rests an overstuffed leather couch
of deep hunter green with a matching leather armchair, separated
by a marble-topped dark cherry coffee table graced by a large
Tiffany lamp. A four-poster bed of deep cherry dominates the far
corner of the room. The faint scent of sandalwood emanates from
two fat candles on the mantle over the fireplace. A discrete
brass sign hangs on the wall beside the door.
The door is closed and locked.
The only exit is out.
