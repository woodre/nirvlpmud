%Krillgeta leaves into the Cafeteria.
%You follow Krillgeta...

%    The In Campus Cafeteria is mainly used by the professors and
the staff of the University during breaks from their job.  The 
students also like to come here and gather in a relaxed atmosphere.
There arent many tables here to sit around, because the University
management tends to discourage people from lazing around instead
of working.  The bartender works behind the long counter, she is all 
intent upon serving the people that usually come here and run away 
very fast.  She also prepares her own specialties by getting the 
ingredients from the shelf behind herself.  Beware, the bartender
does not work 24/7.
%    There are three obvious exits:% exit%,% enter% and% games%
