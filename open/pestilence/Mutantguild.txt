I have a basic idea for a mutant guild, it's only in the planning stages right now
but here is what i have on it so far.
Basically to become a mutant a player would go into a chamber and expose themselves
to hightensity radiation.  This radiation would then change the players's body
giving them different powers.  The radiaton would cause several different types
of mutants, such as ones who use their minds in combat, those who rely on their
body strength, others that rely on being more agile and elusive, and a few more
possibilities.  Also there is a chance the radiation would change a player into
a gimp.  This would leave them basically like a normal player but with max stats 
of 15, and no other powers to be gained.
When i have more on spells for each different mutant and costs etc i will add 
it here.
