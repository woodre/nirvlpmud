The purpose of this whole project

Extracted from original letter

{
   I suggest that we take some of the old realms and improve them.
   This includes fixing bugs and typos as well as improving slow or
   memory consuming code. Apart from the obvious effect of getting
   more seamless realms, I can see at least two other big bonuses:
   - The old realms are in many cases keeping Nirvana from evolving,
   but it is definitely possible to make realms that are insensitive
   to mudlib changes. Recoding realms can lead to new possibilities.
   - It would be a learning experience. Coding is just one of those
   things that take training and then more training. And recoding old
   realms is nothing but massaging the coding centres of the brain.
}

If progress is good, we can evaluate it now and then. ;-)

Bal:    Since we may add things (expand) to the realms, I suggest
        we do our thing in iterations:
        First iteration: Rejuvenate. Second iteration: Add features

** Something to add? Type away! **
