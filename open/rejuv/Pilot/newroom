Room alternative (authored by Bal)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I took one of Scathe's most simple rooms and "streamlined" it. If
you want to see the original room, it is ~scathe/cave/cave2.c. The
resulting room, also named cave2.c, is in the same directory as
this file.

The purpose of this document is to give an example of what I have
in mind when I talk about streamlining things. It is not meant as
a example of how things should be. There might be design flaws in
my base room - it surely contains some of my idiosyncrasies. It
may seem strange (at first), so please ask, and make sure to drop
me a line with comments.

I don't want to take each line and comment on it, but rather out-
line some of the ideas behind the room:
* Encapsule as much of the basic logic in the mudlib room.
  (e.g. eliminate the need to think about init() and move_player()
  functions)
* Provide as much functionality as possible in the mudlib room.
  (like easy blocking of non-newbies going south)
* Limit the wizard's need to make assumptions about any part of
  the mudlib. (see the first *, and compare the 2 rooms..)

I realize I am talking about getting an alternative (room/newroom.c?)
to the original room/room.c and perhaps eventually fully replacing 
it. I know it won't be easy - it might even be impossible. But it is
definitely not impossible to do something like my example..

If you really need to look at the generic room (like room/room.c)
that I use, see ~balowski/std/room.c.
