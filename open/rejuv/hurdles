   Ok, since not everyone has lev 100 file access, we need a system of
   copying the castles over to a dir where they can be worked on, then
   copying them back. I think it would be a good idea to code something
   that could keep track of this, and would drop it in a file for later
   reference. Also, It will be difficult to do the filename thing - if
   you are fixing scathes castle, and a monster of his clones an object
   of his, then it wont load unless you fix the filename. Perhaps an
   #include with a #define for a base dir would be a good idea. Of
   course this would stay with the code - that is, unless someone wanted
   to go back and remove it from all the files.
   There should also be direct accountability - if scathes castle has cheat
   crap in it, then there should be no more than 4 people that could have
   done it - senior wizards excluded, of course.
