Pool of realms up for rejuvenation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scathe's        see /open/pool/scathe

Predator's
        (without checking)
        Bugged, but otherwise (theme?) okay

Hippo's
        Email sent to Hippo/Rene 96-02-21
        Memory demanding and popular
        Some bugs reported (DNA strings disappearing)

Mizan's
        Okayed for recoding by Mizan via mudmail
        (limited knowledge)
        Big and complex realm. Memory consumptious.

** Not really sure that this file should exist, perhaps one for each realm **
