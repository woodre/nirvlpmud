Ideas for improving realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Longer explanation may be necessary, this is for the short ones.

- use objects provided in /room and /obj (e.g. /room/room.c)
  if necessary, make new generic objects for the mudlib
  + Mud becomes more code homogenous. Saves memory (amount?)

- remove direct references to variables in mudlib objects. (e.g.
  short_desc in room/room)
  + Allows mudlib objects to change without bad effects

- where possible, use clone (not inherit) for unique items.
  + Saves one object every time

- avoid adding string literals. (like "a" + "b") The driver is
  not clever enough to combine them at compile time
  + Saves (>halves) memory used for text

- Stray thought: Remove driver dependencies
  + Allows easy transition to new and faster game driver.
