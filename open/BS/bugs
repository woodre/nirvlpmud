>> BUGS 
This is very important. Bugs are YOUR responsibilty. Everyone makes code        
that has them- but it is _your_ job to make sure everything is bug-free. 
Playtesting is VERY important, and you must understand how to do it.  
You must think like a weasel, and try to break down the code as much  
as possible, and not sit around playing with all your new weapons...
*REPEAT* you _have_ to get in the mentality to exploit your code for    
all it's worth.
