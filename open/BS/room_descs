>> ROOMS

Long describes are VERY important. Refer to that file for a complete
run-down. The mud uses a standard format for rooms- try to adhere to it
as much as possible. By that I mean the last line appended to the
description- '    There are two obvious exits: north and south'
try not to change that around too much- unless the layout of your
castle warrants i- e.g. a three-dimensional box-grid.

I don't care how many 'items' are in a room. Recently, people seem to
be focusing on that. Remember- it's the _quality_ of the describes, and
of the items inside the room as well. A 6-room castle that has been
carefully planned out, and carries its theme well is MUCH better than
a 200 room monster that is complete and utter crap.

Avoid using 5 rooms to show that the player is 'in a very long hallway'.
Clever usage of the describes will illustrate that just fine. If the castle
is compact, and not too spread out like that, players will actually
stop moving long enough to read the describes.

One-way doors and various assorted secret entrances are things that
are excellent for improving the intrigue and mystery level of a castle.
Use common sense though- try not to overdo things.
