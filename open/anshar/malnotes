          Be sure to put the check in to make sure it is a valid object
          that is taken when fighting him(like we talked about)
          
tanu.c - set_spell_mess2(): seer = sear

           Change the call_out to a heart beat function. Right now it will call_out
           even if someone is not in the room. Also, it errors on the line:
               if(!present(this_object())->query_attack(),envto) { 
           Simply change this to: if(!query_attack()){  and you will
           get the same effect. Remember, call outs can be bad unless you
           check to stop them.



Overall: get rid of the call_outs to rebeat, as well as the functions for it.

deathmaster.c - doesn't hurt on call_outs to do a remove_call_out then the next call_out
                just to make sure your not getting multiple calls.
                remove_call_out("check");
                call_out("check", 500);
                for instance...
