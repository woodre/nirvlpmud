The note is titled 'bitch(mizan)':

Blah. This should be on the board downstairs. So sue me (Don't get any ideas
Sado ;)

You people who bitch at me because 'this thing ate me without warning', and
'this Borg cube thing suddenly appeared in my castle, analyzed me, and
 zapped me and i lost all my stuff can you give it back plus the 100K
 experience for my mudkids?' better STOP.

Yes, my jello tub castle has a lot of good stuff to help players, and the
monsters are always at their recommended legal limits for reward-carrying,
but all that stuff comes at a price, namely life-threatening hazards.
There are monsters that will eat you and steal your stuff, and the
occasional tornado will suck you up, and the Borg cube likes to zap people,
but HEY, life isnt always nice and peachy. I could be a real prick but NONE
of my hazards affect new players (level 5 and under) and you have to
physically type 'kill tiamat' in order to experience the abject pleasure of
dying repeatedly. I mean, get a CLUE, the monster has 9 heads and carries
no less than 30000 gold coins and weighs about 100000 kilograms so go figure,
it's gonna be a BITCH to kill... *fbog*
