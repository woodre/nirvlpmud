\viewkind4\uc1\pard\f0\fs20 Proposed Assassin Guild\par
\par
General Concept:\par
\par
Originally this guild was written by Deathmonger, to my knowledge, some time in 92.  I became involved with the guild as a player, and eventually wizzed with the intent of finishing his work and getting the guild into play.  I went into the USMC earlier than I originally planned, and never finished.  Apparently DM returned to Nirvana and resumed work on the guild at some point, but still never finished it.  This is my attempt at finally finishing the guild and getting it in the game.  Another aspect to the guild, is that it will allow the few Warrior Assassins somewhere to move to that's comparable in abilities, effort required to max, and in power and theme.\par
\par
The theme of this guild, as originally put forth, is to have a guild that accepts and encourages contracts on pk-enabled players, and monsters.  Contract terms can be set, ie, return equipment to the contractee, proof of the kill, etc.  The guild originally was to frown on killing anyone without a contract out, but that was due to the rules of Nirvana at that time.  These days, they will have the contracts as well as being able to kill any pk-enabled player.  There will also be a 'Hitlist' as per the original one, that was comprised of targets voted on by guild members.  From a personal standpoint, as an active pker in the Cyberninja, as well as having a pk Dervish (formerly a Shardak), I'd like to see a guild in the game that requires pk to be set, that will be a guild that players actually want to play, despite the potential issues with being pk.  I think this makes the game much more interesting for PKers at least, and doesn't detract from the non-pkers' enjoyment.\par
\par
My plan here is to stick as much as possible to the basic concept of the guild, while updating it to be competive with current guilds.  This involves pretty much rewriting the majority of the abilities, completely rewriting the guild object, and redoing much of the guild hall itself, although the rooms are in pretty good condition.  Out of necessity, I'm having to remove some of the abilities, and replace them with others, and, as there is nothing in the code to support the weapon proficiencies that I've seen so far, I'm going to have to pretty much invent everything.  \par
\par
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\par
\par
Overview:\par
\par
The guild will have a fairly straightforward system of guild levels, which are as follows:\par
\par
Assassin Recruit:             0 exp  Request entrance from a guild member/wiz, minor quest\par
Apprentice Assassin:    500,000 exp  Minor quest\par
Assassin              1,500,000 exp  Level 19, ste and dex maxed, PK set, quest\par
Expert Assassin       3,000,000 exp  Max weapon prof, fairly hard quest\par
Master Assassin       5,000,000 exp  Brutal quest\par
Godfather                            All weapon profs, brutal quest\par
\par
Godfather is more of a GC rank than an actual player level.  It will allow them to have\par
a personal room in the guild hall, see Assassin stats, do misc other things, but won't \par
really allow anything in the way of combat abilities.\par
\par
In addition to those ranks, there are several skillsets that Assassins can train in with\par
exp.  These are, for the most part, optional, although some of them will be extremely \par
useful.  The proposed skillsets are:\par
\par
Poisons:\par
  tranquilizers:     causes aggressive mobs to become unagressive.\par
  agitants:          causes non agg mobs to become aggressive\par
  venom:             constant hp loss\par
  feeblemind:        constant sp loss\par
  paralyze:          short-duration stun\par
  demobolizer:       prevents mob from leaving room (ninja stun, basically)\par
  degen:             like the cyberninja degen, prevents mob from regenning hp\par
  mastery of poison: enhances the effects of all poisons, duration and potency\par
\par
Traps:\par
  snare:             short-duration stun on a player, can't leave room for a hb or two\par
  tripwire:          an alarm basically\par
  blade spring:      rather low damage physical damage trap\par
  poisoned trap:     must have appropriate poison rating\par
  mastery of traps:  lowers setup time for traps, allows them to be done while stealthed\par
\par
Surveillance:\par
  bug:               existing ability in guild..hear what's said on by a player\par
  roombug:           bug a room, hear everything said in a room\par
  spy:               locate a player\par
  scout:             see inventory and coinage of a player\par
  gps tracker:       slap it on a player and it returns their location every hb or so\par
  construct bug:     learn to actually make bugs instead of purchasing them...save coins\par
  cameras:           watch who goes in and out of a room, what goes on there\par
\par
Weapons:\par
  Edged:             parry (defensive, lowers damage dealt or eliminates some)\par
                     riposte (counterattack, when hit, grants an extra hit sometimes)\par
                     dual wield\par
  Firearms           marksmanship (enhances wc/damage a little)\par
                     advanced marksmanship\par
                     dual weapons\par
  Small:             quickstrike (grants extra attacks occasionally)\par
                     parry (defensive)\par
                     dual wield\par
                     throw weapon\par
  Unarmed            very difficult to raise, but will eventually allow an assassin to \par
                     fight very effectively completely unarmed\par
\par
Disguise:\par
  Basic disguise:    mask guild, basically\par
  Improved disguise: name, alignment, guild\par
  Advanced disguise: can change virtually anything, but not mimic existing player\par
  Impersonate:       actually assume a very convincing identity as existing player\par
  Master disguise:   shorten prep time, improve duration\par
\par
Those are outside the guild level progression, can be trained any time.  The lower order abilities are fairly cheap, whereas the more powerful ones will be very expensive.\par
The first weapon proficiency will be around 1.5 mil to max.  Additional ones will cost 3\par
mil exp to max.  In addition to maxing a weapon type, you can also become more powerful\par
with a specific weapon.  This I will base off of damage dealt by a weapon.  For example,\par
what I'm considering right now is to add damage, wc, and possibility of an extra attack\par
once a weapon is maxed.  If player stinknugget always uses nodachi, he will eventually become more powerful with that nodachi, through extreme familiarity with this weapon.  This, of course, will take a very long time, probably on the order of 1 mil points of damage dealt, to become a grandmaster with a weapon.\par
\par
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\par
\par
Guild Abilities:\par
\par
These are the combat abilities and combat-related abilities that they will gain through\par
guild ranks, and are in no particular order as of right now.\par
\par
stealth:        invisibility, improves with guild level\par
                starts off as the standard invis\par
                improves to an invis with a drain, but no exit/entrance messages\par
                improves to where they can have unlimited movement\par
                godfathers are always invisible unless in pk\par
\par
harm:           the primary attack spell, i hate the name, but i'm keeping it in deference\par
                to the original guild\par
\par
backstab:       powerful first attack\par
\par
hamstring:      powerful first attack, prevents mob from leaving, causes minor negatives\par
\par
blind:          blind a mob, causing it to be easier to hit, lowers its wc slightly\par
\par
escape:         port to the guild\par
\par
perception:     see in the dark, basically\par
\par
reserve:        reserve a monster, disallow anyone from attacking it\par
\par
unreserve:      opposite of reserve\par
\par
decapitate:     death blow\par
\par
stalk:          the ultimate pk ability.  this is an auto-follow, that causes the assassin\par
                to follow mob or player every hb until they are dead or assassin is out\par
                of sp.  constant 15 sp drain per hb....master assassin rank\par
\par
there will be some others, i haven't fully fleshed this out yet, but that's the backbone of the abilities.  There are also other abilities of course, such as a channel, a pkers\par
command, hitlist, contract, and some others, but those fall more under support, and I'll\par
document those as I actually code them and decide on where to put them.\par
\par

\par
Assassins in a nutshell:\par
\par
Advantages:                         Disadvantages\par
\par
Do very impressive damage           Take a lot of damage, low defense\par
\par
Can excel with weapons eventually   Are limited in those weapons\par
\par
Strong in pk (stalk mainly)         MUST be PK, even at lower ranks\par
\par
Have a very wide range of skills    A ton of exp to max everything, on the order of over\par
                                    10 mil exp probably, and that's not maxing all weapon\par
                                    profs\par
\par
                                    -(debating this) only able to party with pkers once \par
                                    they reach Assassin rank (grank 3)\par
\par
                                    Limited in armors...either going to check weight or\par
                                    check ac, not sure which yet.  No helmet (they need\par
                                    visibility and hearing), no gloves (misc yes, gloves\par
                                    no...will have a check for gauntlets and gloves), and\par
                                    no shield...they are all about offense, not defense\par
\par
                                    strict ethos to follow....from assassin rank on, they\par
                                    are to be pk at all times.\par
\par
some very powerful abilities        they generally require large exp expenditures outside\par
                                    of the rank progression, and cost coinage to use (ie\par
                                    gotta buy bugs, trackers, disguises, etc) and \par
                                    generally require set-up times/prep\par
\par
                                    Guild quests required\par
\par
                                    Having me as guild wizard (fear)\par
