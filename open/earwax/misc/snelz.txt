>> YOU ARE DEAD!

Spuck opens a fold and reaches in from the ether-muck and drags your soul to
Destination Linna. You have been brought back into the Guild room.

Spuck tells you: I tracked your corpse to be in:
       'Tower Hidden [mirror,back]'!
Spuck tells you: 'Aizen' was present.
Spuck tells you: Good luck getting your corpse back...

        This spot seems to have a very consistent ether-muck viscosity,
  and it seems to lift stress right off your shoulders like a sublime
  form of therapy. You can get a better view of the ether-muck from here,
  in all of its confused glory. You are not exactly sure why, but this
  area in particular feels just like home.
There are many obvious exits: up, machine, adv, fatso, spork, zognut,
trollo and polar.

A toaster.
A huge wooden catapult.
A big cardboard box.
A Wacky Zacko pinball machine.
There is no bag here.
