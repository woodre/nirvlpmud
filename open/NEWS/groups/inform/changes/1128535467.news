The output from the 'who' and the 'who2' commands have been updated to 
reflect some of the internal changes that are going on behind the scenes. 
 
The developer community is shifting to allow for more flexibility in 
meeting [and hopefully exceeding] the needs of the game. Thank you for 
contributing.
