The Mythos chat lines/chatters [createchat, leave_chat...] have
been expanded to include a history feature. If you type 'history'
as the argument for your chat, it will display the last few
lines of the chat.

For Example:
    If you have a chat defined as 'ow', you would type in
    'cow history' to see the history for that chat.
