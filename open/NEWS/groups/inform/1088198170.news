You may 'keep' a given object so you do not accidentall drop it or
sell it.  You must 'unkeep' it to enable these functions again.

You may also 'keep/unkeep all' & 'keep/unkeep eq'.
  Make sense?
  Good.

Do not abuse these functions because I will zap you. Yes, I do have
that power.

Report all bugs.  Have fun.
