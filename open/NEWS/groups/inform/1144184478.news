If you can't find a certain castle where you can buy 
real estate, type 
 
"castle <wizardname>" 
 
That invokes a castle spell. 
If you cannot use it, i.e. your guild disallows game spells, 
 
try the old adventurer in the adventurer's guild. He's 
been updated with very general information on every 
area in the mud.
