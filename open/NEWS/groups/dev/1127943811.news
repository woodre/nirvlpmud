Unless you are a Senior or higher level, do not handle player or 
wizard disputes yourself. In the case of a player dispute, refer them 
to Player Affairs [currently Stardream]. 
 
In the case of a wizard dispute, refer them to the Administration 
[actively Fred, Vital, Vertebraker or Francesco] 
 
If a case arises where you must deal with a situation immediately, 
i.e. obvious cheating, continued harrassment .. warn the party and 
immediately notify the appropriate department. If you had to take a 
certain action, notify the appropriate department AND note it in your 
workreport. 
 
No one else, especially not BOLTAR is to be involved in petty 
squabbling.
