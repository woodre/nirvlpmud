I am planning to group any area which refers to a movie into a single 
location, namely the "Nirvana cinema". The cinema wil consist of several 
rooms which allow to enter different movies, so that each owner can still 
edit / update / maintain his/her own movie. Anyone interested please send 
me a message with the theme of the present / future movie to code or to be 
added to the cinema.
