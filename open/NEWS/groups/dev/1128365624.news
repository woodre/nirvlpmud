Message: 
I constructed a new prison, still located in /room/prison. 
 
The commands are the same, the arguments are slightly tweaked: 
 
'imprison <who> <days>' :   Imprison a player for a certain number of days. 
You do not need to supply a reason now. There wil tracking player problems 
later. 
 
  The prison will automatically release the player now   after the amount 
of days that you have specified. 
 
'free <who>' :   Free a player from prison.   This will start a cycle 
wherein when the player logs   in, he will be released from jail. If he is 
already   present, it will suck him in. . 
 
Ooh, one thing I forgot to mention.  "imprison" also works pending login. 
You can now jail people when they are logged off  for infractions they have 
committed. 
 
There are a few extra commands in /room/prison, you should take a look at 
it. 
 
Do not forget that you can only release the players that you have jailed. 
You must contact Stardream in order to bail out appeals -- she is the 
warden.
