Once again it is time to stir up some trouble, listen to the 
fat old lazy players whine and try to pump some new life 
into our beloved game. 
 
As some of you already know I took a bit of a sabbatical, a 
bit of a tour of the muds out there that are bringing players 
in by the hundreds. Yes, hundreds. Heh who needs pictures? 
 
Now let me just say this right off the bat. I have yet to find 
a mud that captures the heart-in-your-throat pace of combat 
that we enjoy here. Hands down our combat kicks ass. 
 
That being said I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I  
never really thought past that point. What else do you need? 
A lot. A whole lot, well a little that seems like a whole 
lot to the end user. 
 
Here are a few things that I would like to at least discuss. 
They may seem like major changes, but what better time than 
the present?
