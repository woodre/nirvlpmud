 Here we go again, people aren't following the basics. You should all  
know this. Don't make me watch you, don't make start dewizing.  
 
Wizard Player behavior. 
  While I wish to hold wizard player characters to the same standard 
as regular player characters, in a practical sense the standard must be 
effectively higher. Don't take any risk of mistakes that could be seen as 
cheating with or without wizard character powers. 
 
Reading code as a game play advantage. 
  Come on folks, this is just common sense that you shouldn't be doing this. 
It is even more wrong when you use to find exploits. I don't want to hear 
about this again. 
 
Wizard communication leaked to players. 
  The wiz channel and other wizard only type things are just that. They aren't 
to be shared with players. Sharing part stories with players and such only 
makes for trouble and makes trouble worse.  You should all know better. I 
will de-wiz for this. 
 
Lack of character separation. 
  Your wizard character is not to be used in disputes regarding your player 
characters. Player characters of the same person are not to be used to 
settle each others problems etc as enforcers and what have you. Character 
separation is key to the way multiple player characters are allowed for the 
same person. 
 
rutine channel invasion. 
  It's fun to listen in on a guild channel or such every now and then, but 
come on, leave it at that. You don't need to listen to every channel and 
participate / start talking just to annoy people. 
 
bug fixing. 
  Don't leave exploits for your player characters. That's so wrong on so many 
levels and so obvious I don't even know why I have to mention it.
