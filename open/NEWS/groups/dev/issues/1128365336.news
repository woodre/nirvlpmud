[two timing wizards] I have grown tired of your collective actions.  It 
appears that as a group, you have no respect for me.  You pass information 
to reflexworld. You pass code to reflex world. You build on reflex world 
first.  
 
Since you do not respect me, why should I continue to respect you? Why 
should I continue to be good to you, allow you to be a wizard here,  allow 
you to keep your levels when your loyalites lay elsewhere?  When you are 
willing to harm Nirvana, and through it me, for the benefit of others?  
 
I think over the years I've done alot to earn people's respect. How have 
you  earned mine?  
 
Showing me you care more for reflexworld than Nirvana is not showing me 
respect. In fact, it's flipping me the bird. If you actually care about 
being a wizard here, you should seek to rectify that.
