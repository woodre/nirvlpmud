It has come to my attention that Elysium's new life has been coming from 
the nirvana wizard and player base. I am extremely unhappy about this. 
 
As you know, it has been proven and admitted by key developers of elysium 
that their base code was stolen from Nirvana. It also obvious to any casual 
observer that they have stolen much in the way of the wizard lib as well. 
Elysium was started using the code stolen from the classic guild project of 
Nirvana. 
 
The princple adminstration of elysium as their opening celebration 
slandered me and acted to damage this mud by sending spam through the mud 
mail system. 
 
I thought this was all behind us. Yet I now learn that various wizards have 
once again been spreading false rumors to create dis-satisfaction with 
Nirvana and bring people to elysium. Suddenly our login numbers are way

If the wizard base here wants reflex over me, that is your decision. 
However, keep in mind that elysium sucks it's life force from nirvana. 
Without nirvana it would not exist. Without the people from here it dies. 
Conversely, if too much is sucked out of nirvana, Nirvana will die.
