I'm not going to get into the specifics and for the most 
part it's not a problem, but if you are NOT specifically 
the guild wiz of any particular guild, don't try to enforce, 
dictate, reprimand, guild issues unless it's absolutely 
necessary to do so.  If you feel it's an issue contact 
the person in charge of said guild.  If nobody is listed 
as in charge on the 'help guilds' please talk to other 
wizes (pool our thoughts) on the guild issue.  Thanks
