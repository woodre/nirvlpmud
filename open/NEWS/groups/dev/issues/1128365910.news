Enough. If you're a wizard and you're going to talk trash to players, sit 
around and bitch all day, then it's time to reconsider whether you want to 
be a wizard or not. 
 
It's time once again to read wiz_behavior and realize that you are supposed 
to be an EXAMPLE to players. AS YOUR PLAYER CHARACTERS AND AS YOUR WIZARD, 
THERE IS NO SEPARATION. 
 
IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTING IN FOSTERING A POSITIVE ATMOSPHERE AND 
REBUILDING THE MUD AND SEEK ONLY TO DENIGRATE AND DESTROY OUR EFFORTS, THEN 
YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF DEMOTED. 
 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. 
 
PLAYERS CAN BITCH. YOU CANNOT.
