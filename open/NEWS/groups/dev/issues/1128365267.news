[continued] If you want to kill nirvana, keep helping reflex. I find this 
defection, done behind my back, without so much as one item of dis 
satisfaction brought to my attention, to be very personal. It says to me 
that even after all these years I haven't even earned to the right to 
correct whatever it is that isn't liked. That all my efforts to run a free, 
fair, and honest mud have gone for naught. 
 
I don't want to make a rule banning elysium wizards from here. But it is 
clear that I am being pushed in that direction. If you want to live in 
reflex world, I just may give you that wish. I cannot compete with reflex 
as I will not lie and steal code. I will not spread false rumors. I cannot 
compete and refuse to compete on that level. If this means Nirvana dies, so 
be it. 
 
I feel insulted and sadened as I have given people free choice and they 
have chosen against me despite knowing the real story. To those just 
'hedging their bets' by playing both sides, you're a bunch of chicken 
shits. 
 
To those that have been supportive the last two years, I thank you. I know 
who my real friends are.
