Please, please, please.... pay attention to note about Player Characters 
folks. 
 
Vertebraker didn't type it cause he likes to read his own words, just like 
I am not writing this cause I like mine. It's time to start acting like 
wizards, or you'll no longer be wizards. This goes especially if you are 
level 30 and below, cause you obviously haven't proved squat yet. So quit 
chirping on public channels (muffle them if you have to), and get coding. 
And while your area is in approval - you could always code something else!
