Several developers have, as of late, been given the opportunity to explore 
being a player again. That is a polite way to say we've demoted them for 
various reasons. As with any issue regarding players & developer conflict, 
it it best to leave it to the Player Affairs personnel. Stardream, Fred and 
if they are unavailable, myself will do our best to handle these issues as 
required. 
 
Be very sure, that no decision to promote, demote or otherwise assign a 
task to a given developer is done without a lot of discussion between 
myself, Fred, Vertebraker and often the other seniors. If a developer has 
been moved back into the realm of players, it is with just cause and not 
the megolamaniacal whimsy of V, V, F, F & F. [Verte, Vital, Fred, Fakir & 
Fran] 
 
This message refers to ALL former developers in general, and specifically 
to those who have become players within the last couple of weeks.
