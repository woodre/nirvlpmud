It appears that a conversation I had with Kazer is being used by reflex  as 
a recruitment tool. He is spinning it as giving my blessing to his mud 
which I refer to as assium. The conversation was nothing of the sort. 
First, it was to be between me and kazer, without reflex. It seems that 
kazer betrayed my wishes in that regard.  
 
second, we were discussing kazer starting a fresh mud, not a new lib for 
assium. Reflex is stating that it is a new lib for assium, not a new mud. 
So either kazer or reflex lied to me as both cannot be true.  
 
third, kazer promised that no nirvana code would be used on this new mud of 
his. Only some stuff that was fresh on assium would be carried over. Now it 
appears all of assium will be carried over and assium will not be closing. 
My offer to help kazer was based on my general offer of helping people

My offer to help kazer was based on my general offer of helping people 
starting fresh muds of their own. If this is not the case no help will be 
given. No blessings or anything else.  
 
Assium runs my code, without my permission. It does so to this very day. 
How do I know this? It's my code, there's alot of it, they'll never  be 
able to purge it without starting fresh. I've see it with my own eyes and 
seen my comments, my variable names, my code. Code I wrote a decade ago or 
more.  
 
If someone tries to recruit you from there, do not take this  conversation 
as my blessing, it is not. It was a conditional conversation and it appears 
the conditions will not be met. In fact, I now feel it was designed 
specifically to dupe me into saying the things I have always said with 
regard to new muds being started from scratch.
