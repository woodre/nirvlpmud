Message: 
if players have problems with each other and require wiz intervention [or 
if they have problems with wizes], please tell them to talk to Stardream, 
as this takes the load off our backs as wizards and promotes unity of 
policy. If they persist that the problem be fixed now, please attempt to 
deal with it and update Stardream as to the situation. 
 
In addition, if Stardream, Fred or Vital ask you any questions in regards 
to a particular player or wizard problem please answer her as fully as 
possible as you would any player affairs wizard. As all player affairs 
wizards are effectively inactive, she has stepped up to the plate. 
 
Unless you are a Senior or higher level, do not handle player or wizard 
disputes yourself. In the case of a player dispute, refer them to Player 
Affairs [currently Stardream & Fred]. 
 
In the case of a wizard dispute, refer them to the Administration [actively 
Fred, Vital, Vertebraker or Francesco] 
 
If a case arises where you must deal with a situation immediately, i.e. 
obvious cheating, continued harrassment .. warn the party and immediately 
notify the appropriate department. If you had to take a certain action, 
notify the appropriate department AND note it in your workreport. 
 
No one else, especially not BOLTAR is to be involved in petty squabbling. 
love, Dr. V
