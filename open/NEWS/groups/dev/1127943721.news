As per the post on the green, housing is ready. 
 
If anyone would like to make a room (or rooms) in their area land 
(in other words, allowing it to be sold, and a home to be built on 
it - basically an object added to it), see the sample room in: 
/players/earwax/housing/sample_room.c or the rooms in my area, 
or Fred's that he's so graciously converted already :).  My area 
is in /players/earwax/area/fields/room/.  To convert a room into 
land all that needs to be done basically is adding inheritance to 
/players/earwax/housing/land.c and setting the cost of the land,  
size (indicating whether it can support a hut, house, palace, etc), 
and the name of the area it's in (ie, Fallen Lands, or something 
else descriptive.  To see what the listings look like, goto 
/players/earwax/housing/realty.c, which is where players will be 
buying these pieces of land. 
 
Any questions, feel free to mudmail or talk to me when I'm on and 
not idle :)
