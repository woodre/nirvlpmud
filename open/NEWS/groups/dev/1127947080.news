Come one, Come all, to the vNews System. Feel free to post 
messages to the newsgroups. I don't have the poster as far 
along as the reader, but it is functional. 
 
clone /open/NEWS/poster.c and then type 'post'. You'll be 
presented with a selection of the various groups to put 
the message in, then a header, and finally the message. If 
you screw up, the messages are saved in text format in the 
/open/NEWS/groups folders and can be fixed if need be. 
 
Thanks for posting notes. Your support helps make this mud 
the wonderful place that it is.
