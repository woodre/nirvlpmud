  Don't harrass anyone about approvals. If you already 
 communicated with them about it, there's no reason to 
 bug them about it again. This is a leisure mud, not a 
 for-profit game. Therefore have courtesy and respect. 
 Approval is excruciatingly uninteresting, but necessary. 
 If a significant amount of time has passed, submit it 
 to someone else in the "Administration Staff" category. 
 Work up the ladder. (Yes, if no one else is available, 
 Boltar WILL take a look at it.)
