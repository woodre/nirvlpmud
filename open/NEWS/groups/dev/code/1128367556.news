Subject:   'efun' command

For those that are interested, the following command has been added to your 
repertoire:   efun 
 
It can be used alone: 'efun' for a listing of most current efuns It can 
also be used with the name of an efun:   efun <efun_name> for more 
information about that efun. 
 
Thank you and happy coding.
