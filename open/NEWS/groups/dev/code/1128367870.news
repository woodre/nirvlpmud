Message: 
mappings don't save in save_object() !!!! i have no problem with any other 
data types, but mappings simply seem to be invisible to save_object() and 
restore_object(), is there any way around this other than to convert arrays 
to mappings in reset() and then back to arrays when you save?  
 
i was putting together a daemon where mapping was pretty much the ideal 
data type to use, but having a mapping and 2 arrays seems like it's a bit 
inefficient in this area.
