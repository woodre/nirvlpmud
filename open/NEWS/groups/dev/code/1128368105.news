As far as I know, there's no way to keep reset() from being called in an 
object periodically.  However, reset() is always passed an argument- when 
the object is first loaded, that argument is 0; subsequently, it is 
non-zero.  So, if you start your reset function out thusly: void 
reset(status arg) {   if(arg) return; Any initializations you have below 
should be safe from periodic reset() calls. 
 
Note: if you're inheriting another object with reset, make sure to put 
::reset(arg) before your if(arg) return;.
