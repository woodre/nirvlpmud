If you have to delete from an array, you may 
want to consider the new sfun i've written, a_delete(). 
The code is in /obj/simul_efun/a_delete.c 
 
Essentially the -= operator will delete the first 
record of whatever element you are deleting, even 
if you would want it to delete the second or third 
or whatever. This can cause big problems in lists. 
 
a_delete() makes sure that it deletes the exact 
element that you want. 
 
Syntax is: 
   mixed *str; 
   str = a_delete(int i, str);
