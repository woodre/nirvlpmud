Do not restore a player's guild object if you do not know wtf you are 
doing. Have them type 'guild_object'. If it does not work, help them get in 
touch with their guild wizard or a higher level wizard who knows how to 
restore their gob. Fiddling around with it causes errors as Bolts has 
pointed out before.
