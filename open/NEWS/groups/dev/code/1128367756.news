I recently discovered a very strange bug. 
 
restore_object() errors if it tries to restore an array 
of strings if one of them has a backslash at the end of it. 
 
Just bringing this to your attention.. to prevent this with 
the new quicktyper lib commands, I wrote some preventive 
code that perhaps you could weld to your usage in the event 
of this very strange bug. 
 
     sa = strlen(arg1)-1; 
     sb = strlen(arg2)-1; 
 
     if(arg1[sa..sa]=="\\" || arg2[sb..sb] == "\\") 
      return (write("Due to a weird driver bug, aliases may not have\n" + 
                    "a backslash [\\] at the end of either the alias\n" + 
                    "or definition.  Sorry for any problems this may\n"+ 
                    "cause you.\n"), 1); 
 
This isn't a very common error, but apparently it can cause 
a problem.
