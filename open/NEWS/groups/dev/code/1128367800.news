query_property() in room.c is more of a fun to be used within the room obj 
itself, not to be queried by spells, since it will only return the indices 
within the array of property. 
 
Just do your checks for no magic areas and so forth like you normally 
would.. 
 
use add_property()/remove_property() for initializing the rooms to whatever 
:) 
 
I know it's confusing.. but I strove for compatibility rather than 
functionality when I wrote it.
