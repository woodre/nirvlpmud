Bah, I'm using this_player() and it's going fine.  I'd still like to know 
if anyone has any idea on why it bugs that way though.  Is it a driver bug 
(which is what I assume) or is there another way to work around it other 
than by using this_player() (just in case I ever have to use it that way)?
