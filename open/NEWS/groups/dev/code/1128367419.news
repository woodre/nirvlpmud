If you're changing a mob's weapon_class or armor_class, do not do 
weapon_class += 5; or whatever 
 
do set_wc(query_wc() + 5); 
 
set_wc() uses the correct RegisterWeapon() stuff for example to set the 
proper values and calculate the correctr xp... etc. 
 
 addition: I fixed the bug in the lib that would cause    set_wc() / 
set_ac() objs to screw with calculating the    worth of the critter, i.e. 
Mondar jacking up from 600k   value to 1.5 mil 
 
RegisterArmor(object gear, mixed *params)... 
 
You can't RegisterArmor the same piece of eq more than once. It overwrites 
the other params. To set up multiple resistances, you'll have to pass the 
RegisterArmor an array of multiple resistances like: ({ 
({"other|fire",20,20,"this_object"}). ({ "other|ice",.... etc.
