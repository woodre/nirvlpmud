For those of you who may have some older code that you put together before 
you became aware of sane and proper ways to format and layout your code so 
that yourself and others might be able to read it later, there is hope. 
There are some pieces of software available that can reformat/reindent code 
for you, thus making your life with old code much easier. 
 
For those of you with *nix systems [Linux, BSDs, SysV, etc] or if you use 
Cygwin, there is the excellent bcpp.c program that will quickly give you a 
nice document suitable for printing, framing and mailing to your loved 
ones. It will also help get your code approved faster! The address is 
<http://dickey.his.com/bcpp/bcpp.html>. 
 
For those of you still working in the world of William's Windows there is 
the GC or GreatCode package. If any of you have other suggestions for 
programs that might help folks out with their code, be sure to pass them 
along. The GC stuff is at 
<http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gcgreatcode/GC_1_139.zip>. The 1.139 
package has an exe file that can easily be plugged into CrimsonEditor and 
selected from the Tools menu. Ok, relatively easily.
