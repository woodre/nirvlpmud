Along with Vertebraker, Earwax and myself teaching lpc and generally coding 
issues, I wanted to let you know that I'm also available for other sessions 
as needed by arrangement. If you'd like to extend your skills or explore 
some of the topics covered in greater detail. 
 
Send me a mail if you are interested along with any particular things you'd 
like to talk about [or just "general"] if you are unsure about what exactly 
you want to cover. 
thanks,
