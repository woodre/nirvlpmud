Effective immediately developers need to shift from using your own versions 
of ansi.h to the standard one for the mud. This is a fairly simple fix of 
changing any #include statement with ansi.h in them to just: #include 
"/obj/ansi.h" 
 
The administration will be going through and checking to see if there are 
any extra ansi.h. If you have custom escape codes in your own ansi.h, 
consider submitting them for inclusion in the /obj/ansi.h to help yourself 
and others.
