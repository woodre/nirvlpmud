Just a little idea  .. 
 
When you do objs with an extra_look(), why not make it say 
"You blah blahblah " when they look at themselves? 
 
extra_look() 
{ 
    if(environment() == this_player()) 
      write("You have a big boner.\n"); 
    else 
      write(environment()->query_name() + " has a big boner.\n"); 
} 
 
As an example :)
