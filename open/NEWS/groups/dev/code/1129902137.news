Support for multi-slot armors has been added.  What this means is 
that an armor can now be type 'armor', 'head', 'legs' etc all at the 
same time.  Combined rings, for example, now fill both ring slots  
rather than gloves.  This was done with armors such as full plate 
in mind. 
 
To use this: 
set_type("armor") or whatever like you normally would, and then 
add_type("helmet") or whatever to just add one slot, or 
add_types( ({ "helmet", "legs", "chest" }) );   to add multiple. 
You can get an array of all the slots an armor fills by using 
query_types(), and query_type() will return a type set via set_type() 
 
Armors command was changed so that it shows the same armor in all the 
slots that the applicable armor is using. 
 
Also, looking at a piece of armor displays what type(s) it is, although 
that won't go in for all armors until the next reboot.
