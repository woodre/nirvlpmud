Message: 
We are currently compiling information on the various areas, guilds and 
attractions that are available for players across the game. If you have any 
information to share about your area or a guild, please make sure that you 
either create an .nfo file in /open/info or that you update your existing 
file. 
 
If you are interested in helping with the overall /open/info project 
[reviewing current docs, writing new ones for old areas, exploring] then 
please give Vital or Vertebraker a shout.
