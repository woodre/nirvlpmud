Great news for those having issues with finding a good ftp client. 
I was playing around with the Opera web browser and found it to 
work perfectly with Nirvana's mud FTP server. Horray! 
Just enter ftp://nirvana.beanos.com:3500 in the address bar and it will 
prompt you for username/password. From there it's game on! 
Enjoy!
