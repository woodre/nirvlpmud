New armor types: 
 
bracelet, cloak, chest, necklace, earring, gloves, pants, belt 
 
Check your current offerings of armor and see if there are any that
need to be switched to the new types. 

Players may now wear 2 "ring"s. They may also wear two earrings.

Please update your items, such as "misc" armors which may fall into
these categories, or "ring" armors that may now fall into the gloves
category. Thanks.
