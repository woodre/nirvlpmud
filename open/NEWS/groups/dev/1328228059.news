Achievements 
Something else that I just never would have thought of, 
simple to come up with, easy to implement and the players 
go crazy over them. Have different teirs of achievements. 
Here's something off the top of my head: 
Minor: 
"Little Money Bags" - Have 10000 coins on hand! 
Reward: 5000xp       Trophy:Sparrow on the Shitter 
Moderate: 
"Addictive Personality" - Log into Nirvana 100 times 
Reward: 25000xp      Trophy:Boltar's tear of Joy 
You get the point. There are people that ONLY play some 
muds just to fill up the achievement boards, once we 
get LD running we can tie directly into the web and 
players can track progress online. 
 
Thats a good bit to discuss for now, I have more but I  
want to see the reaction on this. I don't mind doing the 
work but I don't want to hear any complaints after I've 
stumbled my way through the dark with these with no input. 
 
I can get people to come here, seriously there is major 
interest in our combat. We just don't have what we need 
to train or keep them here. Sucks but it's true.
