Newbie School - Ugh 
I will admit that we have the best newbie school that 
I ever remember. Isn't it the only one? This we can get 
into more detail with after we decide what changes are to 
be made. 
 
Player Skills - Crafting and Beyond 
Nirvana really has no character development outside of guilds. 
As far as crafting, I'd like players to be able to take up 
a profession that can net them xps and money outside of combat. 
For example Tyr decides he wants to become a blacksmith and 
specialize in repairing weapons. He advances his skill in 
crafting.blacksmith.weapon and since sharpening stones no  
longer exists (yeah I said it) his skill becomes valuable. 
I'm still working on the skill tree but I will post it soon. 
Combat related skills would work as well, supplementing guild 
abilities or guilds could choose only what skills they allow 
members. 
 
Boltar brought up a good point. Money on Nirvana has no value. 
Inflation is out of control and how do we make anything a 
player does valuable unless we get a handle on the economy. 
I took this idea a little too far and found some admins that 
have actually made an Economy work on a mud. Keep in mind,  
this wasnt retrofitted into a 20 year old mud. I have a 
proposal written up at /players/sparrow/open/economy/economy.txt 
It's a bit overboard I hear. Look at it, see what you like, 
what you dont. Discuss.
