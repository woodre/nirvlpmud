Everyone offer a condolence to Glaxgor. 
His father has passed away. 
 
In addition, please take a moment out of your time 
to visit the beautiful memorial Glaxgor and I wrote 
for his father. It's located just south of Puppy's 9/11 
memorial. 
 
Type 'castle puppy' from the village. 
'enter memorial', d, s 
 
Thanks.
