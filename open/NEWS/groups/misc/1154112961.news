Message: 
The donation box at the green has been changed some.  If you 
look at it you'll see that you can't "put <item> in box" anymore. 
The new command is "stash <item>" or "stash all".  With this 
change all items stashed in the donation box will be made non 
saveable and have no value in the shops.  Thanks.
