I have updated my area, it is still 1 west of the Time Warp, read the sign to find out more. 
I have opened a new area as well, it supports mobs of 30-50k range, has some nifty 75/75 heals,  
however they are drugs so watch out for side effects.  Let me know what you think 
and if you find any bugs please mail me and let me know. 
 
Thanks, 
Tristian
