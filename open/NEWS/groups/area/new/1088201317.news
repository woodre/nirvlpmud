Ladies and Gents, Children of All Ages,
My area has been reopened in the south forest.  It
is a lot different now, and a bit smaller for the
time being, but fun none the less.

Ask the old traveller in the Adventer's Guild for
more information. [remember him?]

Enjoy and mail me with any problems,
Forbin
