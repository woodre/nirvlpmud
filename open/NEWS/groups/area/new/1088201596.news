Well, seems you players have forgot that in Nirvana there is a
cinema. The movie played there is amazing and super cool, trust me.
The monsters are weak, the money low and the items of little useage?
This is a good reason to go there and relax, without caring much of
the exp/coins, just enjoying the atmosphere :) Ask Hope for the
ticket and have fun  :)
