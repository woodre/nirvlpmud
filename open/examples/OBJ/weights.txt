An attempt to make standard weights:

1: ring, choker, necklace, button, needle, paper, hat, gloves
2: dagger, bracers, potion, book, helmet, gauntlets
3: short sword, shield, bow, leather jacket, half-chain
4: broadsword, longsword, staff, large shield
5: battleaxe, warhammer, bastard sword, chainmail, polearm
6: two-handed sword
12: full plate armor

* Full plate armor would be an actual 'suit' of armor - taking up all
  armor spots in exchange for ac9. This is presently not in existance.

Exceptions:  magic items will vary slightly from these weights - the
             more magic (and corresponding difficulty to obtain), the
             wider possible variation. Of course magic items can also
             weigh more as a drawback for power.
