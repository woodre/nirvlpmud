Some little functions that do a lot for atmosphere--
capitalize() as in capitalize(this_player()->query_name())
  capitalizes the first letter of the string

query_possessive() as in this_player()->query_possessive()
  returns "his" or "her"

These are nice in weapons and many other things. Try to use them.
