There is a 3-D Flight Simulator in Excel 97.  The constant rain in
Redmond has driven Bill's engineers to
obsessive flights of fancy.  Here are instructions on how to access a
little flight simulator that was inexplicably hidden by
precipitation-maddened programmers deep inside Excel 97.

(1)  In Excel 97, open a new blank work sheet.
(2)  Press F5 and type X97:L97 in the "Reference" box, then click OK.
(3)  Now hit your tab key once (you should end up in cell M97).
(4)  Press "Ctrl" and "Shift" while clicking once on the "chart wizard"
icon (the one at the top with the blue-yellow-red bar chart).

Welcome aboard ! After a few moments you should be flying.  Steer with
the mouse, accelerate and decelerate with the left and right mouse
buttons respectively, and look for the monolith with the programmer
credits.  You can exit the screen by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc.
