Temple is roughly based from dragon ball z but is basically just a set up for the other 2 areas i have planned which will branch off from the temple in different directions. 
The directories for the temple are /players/mosobp/areas/TEMPLE/NPC..../OBJ.....and rooms also map is a map of the area.
there are 8 mobs can  make more if need be. 
there are 5 different objects as well.
it is set up for newbies so low level mobs.
