unicornpark1.c
    Add a desc for "trees"

unicornpark2.c
    Add desc for "leaves"

unicornpark3.c
    In the long_desc:
        "The shadows makes it look like"  -->   "The shadows make it look like"
        "It is a little darker and has spooky"   -->   "It is a little darker, and has a spooky"
    In the items:
        "Thick lushies foliage moving in and out of each other."   -->   "Thick lush foliage 
        weaves in and out above you"

unicornpark4.c
    In the items:
        Desc for house..  enterance is spelled wrong, but you can just copy the desc for cave 
        onto this one as well and it would be fine 
  
unicornpark5.c
    In the items:
        Add a desc for unicorn..  it can be the same as for statue
        You could add one for birds..  something about them being too hidden to see, but are 
        singing prettily..  just because birds is a noun in the long desc, and most, if not 
        all, of those ought to be able to be looked at.


unicornpark6.c
    In the long_desc:
        No need for the comma after "stand so high"
    In the items:
        Again, all the nouns ought to be described, and though I know you hate this, this
        includes nouns within the descriptions of other nouns..  I look at pine and I see 
        needles and cones..  but I can't look at the cones.  So needles, cones, bark, leaves,
        and branches ought to be described..  doesn't need anything fancy..  just a few 
        words will do
    One more thing for this room..  in the very last notify_fail a few lines before the end
        of the file, add a \n like the others

unicornpark7.c
    "From up here" in the long_desc three times is really redundant.  Try re-wording it..  
    maybe something like 
        "This is the top of the redwood tree, and the view is magnificent.  The deep green
        tree tops look so luscious from up here that it seems like you are looking at a 
        giant green carpet."
    Also notice the addition of the word "the" in front of redwood, and the spelling change 
        in the word luscious"
    No comma needed after "blue" in the last line of the desc
    Add items for tree and trees, which can have almost the same description
    Add an item for carpet

unicornpark8.c
    In the long_desc:
        "breathtaking" is one word
        Add a comma after "Both seem to run into each other"
    In the items
        Add a desc for tree and trees, view, clouds (even though there aren't any..  say 
        that), carpet, feathers, and twigs
    In the add_action:
        Again, the last notify_fail a few lines before the end of the file..  add a \n like 
        the others.

unicornpark9.c
    In the long_desc:
        "breath taken"  -->  "breathtaking"
        Comma after "color" in the last line
        Period after "touch"
    In the items:
        Add descs for tree, trees, and view

unicornpark10.c
    In the long desc:
        The first sentence seems a little awkward..  maybe "The only tree in this field
        is a large oak surrounded by flowers."
        Also notice the spelling change on "surrounded"
        In the third line it would likely sound better to just say "brighter and warmer"
        In the last line, comma after "color"
    Add descriptions in the items for tree and field.
