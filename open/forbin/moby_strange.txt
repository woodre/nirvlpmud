the vaulted ceiling sporting brightly colored frescoes vaguely
reminiscent of high Renaissance art and an enormous crystal
chandelier that scatters glittering light throughout the lobby.
The long mahogany counter is polished to a mirror finish which
reflects the tasteful sign hanging on the wall behind it. A
hotel employee in busies himself at the end of the counter,
ready to assist should you inquire. Scattered about the lobby
are several leather couches and mahogany tables, arranged into
intimate conversation groups. An inlaid gold panel above the
door to the west reads, 'Casino', while an identical panel
above the door to the east reads, 'Restaurant'. An eye-catching
playbill is posted beside the east door showcasing the nightly
live entertainment in the Theater. A curved grand staircase rises
from just west of the counter, eclipsing the discrete elevator
just to the east of the counter. A doorman watches the revolving

%This large foyer connects the lobby with the foot of the grand
staircase that rises gracefully upward to the next level of the
hotel.  The cool marble of the floor dully reflects the light from
the elaborate chandelier that hangs overhead.  Two enormous Grecian
urns flank the curved wrought iron handrails, each overflowing with
a tangle of lush ivy and brightly hued flowers. The white panels
of the ceiling, each decorated by a raised plaster flower in 
various pastel shades in its center and gilding along its edges, 
provide a simple contrast to the complicated frescoes in the 
adjoining lobby to the east. The muted, yet unmistakable, sound

corner of the wall reads, 'Rooms 251 - 275'.  Muted ambient
light is provided by a series of tasteful Tiffany lamps resting
on small cherry tables spaced evenly along the length of the
hallway.  A hush lies about the hallway, all sound muffled by
the deep beige carpet which compliments, rather than matches,
the warm paisley pattern on the wall border.  To the east is a
similarly decorated hallway, the marble plate on the corner reading,
'Rooms 276 - 299'.  Another hallway lies to the north, its room

of deep hunter green with a matching leather armchair, separated
by a marble-topped dark cherry coffee table graced by a large
Tiffany lamp. A four-poster bed of deep cherry dominates the far

two fat candles on the mantle over the fireplace. A discrete

%                       [Help Guilds]
%------------------*===================*------------------------
% 
%     A guild is an association of individuals (sometimes of
%various races or creeds) who have banded together to foster
%their self interest.  Upon joining a guild, you agree to obey
%and abide by the laws, limitations, and enhanced abilities
%set by that guild.  
%     As each guild is unique in its requirements, you should
%investigate each guild carefully before you decide which guild
%suits the personality of your character.  Some questions you
%might ask of those already in a guild might be how the guild 
%leadership is structured, or how the guild will benefit you
%in your advancement in the realm of Nirvana.  You might wish
%to know how the guild feels about Pk, or perhaps what 'special'
%abilities you might one day gain by advancing in that particular
%guild.  You should also be prepared to explain what you will
%bring to the guild as a member.
%     Once joined, most guilds require a severe experience
%penalty for leaving, so make your decision with care and
%More: (lines 1-20) % 
%consideration.  The following is a list of current guilds
%available in the realm of Nirvana, and the Wizard[s] responsible
%for its maintenance.

%
%     Consider that each guild will have both advantages and 
%disadvantages.  Most guilds are intentionaly designed with
%some drawbacks which balance the special abilities, spells,
%or attributes granted to the members.  Ask lots of questions.
%Be respectful of a guild's members... and keep guild information
%confidential.  Once you join a guild, try to role-play your
%character to fit the theme of the guild you selected.
%
%[Notes: If you see "[Beta]" next to the name of any guild,
%       that means the guild is currently in Testing, and
%       isn't currently open to the public.  An asterisk
%       next to the name indicates the original creator 
%       who is currently inactive or doing other things, 
%       so mails may go unresponded to. ()'s indicate who 
%       is taking care of things on a temporary basis.
%       Do 'help closed_guilds' to see a listing of guilds
%       that are closed.
