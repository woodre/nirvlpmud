Jal-Hab Desert

Sections:
  Desert
  The Brigand Caves (2,8)

	The Jal-Hab was once a land of lush forests and lakes, and was
the heart of the once mighty Majiri empire.  That was before the lich
king Gardoran made a bargain with a demon of immense power.  Though he
gained immortality, he lost control of the demon and in its wrath it 
turned the once fertile plains into a barren desert.  Using what magic
remained to them, the magi bound the demon to a temple deep in the 
desert.

The Jal-Hab Desert
------------------
	The desert is your standard map type daemon, with Map.c keeping
track of each of the map rooms which are designated with an x.  From
the map, the player can enter different mini-areas.  There is a chance
of getting lost in the desert, but having a map will reduce this.
	Wizards can see their current coordinates on the map auto-
matically, but players need a sextant or the Wanderer's amulet to do
so.  There is a random chance of getting lost if you don't have a map
or the amulet.
