  The hallway within the Necromancer Stronghold ends in this small chamber.
Bits and pieces of bones adorn a large, dark stone altar, made for those who
wish to contact the Realm of Death. The floor in front of the altar bears a
large sigil, drawn in blood, large enough for a Necromancer to drop a corpse
within. Arcane writings stand out upon one wall, while the exit is eastward,
back down the hallway.
