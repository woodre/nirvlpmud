  The Main Chamber is surrounded by white marble walls, interlaced with deep
blue veins. The torches here cast a dim glow across the walls and floor of
the chamber, and the guild board is secured to the east wall. An arched door
leads east into the library, and the marble chamber continues to the south.
There is a spiral staircase in the center of the room, leading deeper within
the earth, and a hallway is to the west.
