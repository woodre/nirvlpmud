Notes:

I've redone the description for necro1.c and added some items, it gave
the room just a -bit- more flavor than just a transition room from the
entrance to the main guild hall

Is there a point to the 'plaque' currently in the main guild hall? It 
doesn't have a desc.

Redid the desc for necro2, also.

Where -does- the spiral staircase go, btw? In the main guild hall.
