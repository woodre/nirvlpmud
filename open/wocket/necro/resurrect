  Wocket draws a circle on the ground in salt and begins to lay out the fresh
body parts within the circle.  As she whispers some enchantments, her eyes
begin to glow red. She pours blood across the patchwork corpse.

around some mist's soul.  Piece by piece, a new body is assembled.

  Just as the last strand of flesh attaches itself, there is a brilliant flash
of light.
