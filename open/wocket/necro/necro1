  The high archways within this room support the vaulted ceiling, chipped by
years of little upkeep.  The walls are carved of a white marble, interlaced
with delicate blue veins, which have also been dulled by age.  The center of
the floor holds a large circle with many arcane markings, inlaid with small
pieces of stone. The circle glows softly, emanating a dark red mist.  The
great hall opens up through an arch to the north, and doors lead to both the
east and west.  A small tunnel in the southern wall leads out to the city of
Qual'tor.
