I propose switching intox rates from usage
to heal value.  I don't feel it is proper to penalize
players or other types of heals simply for the fact 
that they are healing less.  example
    
   heal/charge   charges  intox/charge  totalheal  totalintox
      50             3        14          150         42
      25             6        14          150         126

Currently it is uneffective for a player and limiting to wizard making
effective heals if this system continues.  It is also unrealistic
that a more potent heal would not intox you more then a lighter one.
I propose the intox rate be based off of the healing per usage instead

    (heal*2)/7 for 10 gold coins giving you a similar charge
   heal/charge    charge   intox/charge   totalheal   totalintox
     50            3           14            150         42
     25            6            7            150         42
     15            10          4.2           150         42
     10            15          2.8           150         42
    
The chart would go something like this:

    intox rate        cost

    (heal*2)/7   for 10 coins
    (heal*5)/19  for 11 coins
     heal/4      for 12 coins
     heal*2/9    for 13 coins
     heal/5      for 14 coins
    (heal*2/11)  for 15 coins
    (heal*4/25)  for 16 coins
     heal/7      for 18 coins
      
I realize this would involve changing all of the current heals to
this system but the only ones that should be effected would be
those that heal under 50 since the fomulas are based off of 
50/intox.
