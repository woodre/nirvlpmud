  Hi there. I've taken the liberty to put some sample files in your ~/demo
directory. These files are enough to get you started coding, but before
you do anything, browse through the /obj and /room dirs. I learned
everything I needed to know from the files in that directory, most
notably /obj/player.c, /obj/living.c, /obj/bull_board.c, and /room/room.c
It would be a good idea for you to capture all these files with your
terminal program to study/pick at later.

  Once you get the hang of .ed use and file/directory navigation, it
would be a very good idea if you peruse /doc/build, /doc/lfun and /doc/efun.
I am perfectly willing to drop anything and help you, but please be patient
with me. I miss tells alot... if it's something important you'd better
keep bugging me :)

  Just to let you know, or a better word is 'warning', I expect a certain
high standard to be maintained in your code. By that, I mean an intangible,
undescribable level of excellence that I am sure you are aware of.
You shouldnt care what players think of your code, but what YOU think.
