Yes I have made an area, Check it out!
Dirs from green: 7east, 3south, sponge, beach :)
Beware it's a super noob area.

Slowly working on my next masterpiece, a large
ocean area starring The Little Mirmaid's castle!

Also trying to learn to be helpful on the mud, 
but please don't rely on me to answer your questions
I'm still in training.
