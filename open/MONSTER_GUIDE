SNOW'S GUIDELINES FOR MONSTERS: What to do so they will not be changed.
 
1) Keep your monster within the theme of whatever area they are in. If
   you have a medieval realm, don't put in shotguns. If you want a 
   crazy, anachronistic realm, label it so.
2) Make your monster a power level commensurate with its description. If
   you make a small frog, make it level 1. If you make a large dragon,
   make it level 20+.
3) If you make a powerful monster, make it powerful. A level 20 dragon
   without even a spell attack is not worth making.
4) If you make a powerful monster, don't clone it many times or
   scatter it around your realm. Level 17+ monsters should be unique or
   at least very rare.
5) Give your monster realistic treasure. Animals do not carry around
   coins so don't put 3000 coins on an elephant just because it is high
   level. Have it clone tusks players can sell, maybe a meat heal. You
   can also put treasure in the monster's lair (making sure players have
   to take care of the monster before getting the treasure). Even humans
   and fantastic monsters should be carrying their coins in something if
   they are going to have a lot.
6) Use the monster regs. /doc/build/RULES/monsters and monster.guide
   should be read before making your first monster and regularly
   consulted. The monster stats are guidelines that you can work with-
   Make your monster's stats fit its description. The treasure values,
   however, are maximums - the monster cannot possibly have more coins
   than the maximum unless approved by a senior wiz. That means that
   random(10000) coins for a level 20 monster is illegal even though
   it averages the maximum.
7) Do not make kill zones. Trying to attract players to your realm by
   cloning multiple high-level, high-coin monsters will lead to the
   area being removed.
8) Try to set a monster race with set_race() unless it is clearly
   a unique type monster.
