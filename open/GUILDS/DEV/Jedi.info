[Introduction]
    Sometime late last year I got the itch to do a new guild for
Nirvana.  The theme that I thought would be the most interesting
is that of the Star Wars Jedi.  Maledicta was close to wizzing
and he was just crazy enough to decide to help me with the
guild and take 50% of the responsibility/ownership!
-----------------------------------------------------------
[Purpose]
    Tell any interested wiz about our plans.  Would also be
nice to get some feedback from seniors about the guild (might
save us some time later).  Any suggestions would also be
appreciated.
-----------------------------------------------------------
[Theme]
    Well how many people don't know about Star Wars and
its Jedi?  The guild will have many of the famous powers that
we have come to know.  The more interesting part of the guild
theme though will be the balance between the light and the dark-
side of the force.  A player that joins the guild will be in a 'netral'
state.  The decisions that the player makes will determine his/her
path.  If they choose the ways of the darkside, at a certain crucial
point it will forever consume them.  For the Jedi who choses the way
of the lightside, they will always have to resist the seduction of the darkside.
The darkside powers are based on destruction, personal gain, anger,
aggression.  The lightside powers are more defensive in nature with
concentration on healing.  A player from either the lightside or the
darkside will have access to the other sides abilities, but using them
has concequences.  The road to the darkside is a fast journey, a 
lightside Jedi that uses them too often will be turned to the darkside
(which will result in setting guild experience back to a much lower level).
Both sides will cast less effective spells the more they move toward the
other side.  Movement from the darkside over to the lightside will most
likely be a task which will involve a large sacrifice (the players life?).
-----------------------------------------------------------
[Restrictions]
      Pets: none for darkside, Droid for lightside that will only be
          able to carry objects, no attacking.
      No game spells: (includes mi,sh,fi,so and invis)
      magic drops to 0
      Maximum coins: 35000 (lightside only)
      No wimpy: (darkside only)
      Armor and weapon restrictions(please note below)
      PK: Any Jedi can attack another at any time (Apprentice
      will be exempt from this since they are not a Jedi yet)

Reasons for restrictions:
       No game spells and magic: The jedi's powers flow from
       the force, and they will not rely on a weaker 
       source for strength.
   Restriction on coins(lightside only): A jedi does not
     use his powers to gain wealth, but to defend and to
     serve. A dark Jedi serves only himself and believes
     that power is derived from wealth, and thus is not
     restricted.
   No wimpy(darkside only): To achieve a semblance of
     power with the darkside one thinks only of rage
     and how to feed it, not of running.
  PK: The two sides of the force instantly creates two guilds
     that will be enemies.
-----------------------------------------------------------
[Guild Levels]

Note:  Levels are same for light/dark side, but the guilds will have separation.
    i.e.  Guild tells will be separate, but if someone joins as an apprentice both
    sides will feel it through the force.

Cost for advancement will be high in keeping with the theme.  A 
Jedi requires much training.  Currently, we are thinking of the total
guild exps requirement to reach master being 3.6 Million, with 1 Million
required for the jump to Master Jedi.  Details to be worked out.  There
will be some guild tasks, but will mostly be for bonuses (extra skills points
to put towards skills) or maybe some powers will require them.

Apprentice: (NOTE: An apprentice may use any armor or wep)
  Level:       Bonus:            Concentration points(CP):
     1          ----                 50 base
     2          ----              +Random(5-10)
     3         +1 Luck            +Random(5-10)
     4          ----              +Random(5-10)
----------------------------------------------------------
Jedi:(NOTE:May only use lightsaber and cannot wear armor
                  of any type.)
  Level:       Bonus:            Concentration points(CP):
     1         +1 Luck            +Random(8-10)
     2          ----              +Random(8-10)    
     3          ----              +Random(8-10)
     4         +1 Luck            +Random(8-10)
     5         +1 Luck            +Random(8-15)
     6          ----              +Random(8-15)
     7         +1 Luck            +Random(8-15)
     8          ----              +Random(8-15)
----------------------------------------------------------
Jedi Master:
  Level:       Bonus:            Concentration points(CP):
     1         +3 Luck            +Random(15-25)
                          **MAX CP of 225...Minimum of 144**

Skills and levels: 
      Each level gained will give so many points
   to put towards skills, whether they be force related or
   physical skills. Also, even though anyone can become a
   Jedi master, even the masters won't have all skills maxed,
   but some will be high and some will be medium. It depends
   on where they place their points and what area they wish
   to be proficient in.

Concentration Points: CP is what all the powers use, similar 
   to sps, but a little different. First, CP regens on its
   own, and heals do not raise it. Second, CP only regens out
   of combat, or at a greater rate while meditating. Thus,
   CP is not something you use every round like a fireball, 
   but to supplement the combat occassionaly with some extra
   damage or protection, or healing outside of combat. Actions
   with the lightsaber for the most part are free from using
   CP(there are some exceptions).
Luck Bonus: What some see as enhanced luck is actually the force
   manifesting itself and helping its user (deflect some of the
   damage; will be random with higher chance as the skill
   level is raised through guild advancement).
-----------------------------------------------------------
[Skills/Abilities]

LightSabers:  The main weapon of the Jedi, they are created 
   by any guildmember that is Jedi level or higher. Thus, for
   an apprentice to get one, they must have it created by 
   their master or someone of high enough level. Creation of
   a lightsaber costs 10000 coins. One other ingredient is
   necessary in creating a lightsaber, and that is its 
   activation crystal. An activation crystal is what gives
   the saber color as well as its lifetime(lifetime is 
   explained in greater detail below). Crystals can be
   bought at the guild hall, which will provide weaker
   crystals. Crystals of greater power can be quested for,
   and when used will give a different color and lifetime.
   Lightsabers are autoload objects that appear unactivated
   in the members inventory.
   LIFETIME: Each lightsaber when activated will use 1 point
     of power for each round until shut down. When shutdown, they will
     not use points. The points are subtracted from a pool
     that is determined by the crystal type. The pool itself
     will be a large amount, keeping jedi's from having to make
     a new saber everytime they log on.
*** As the main weapon and main source of damage, the wc and
    specials from a lightsaber should be considerable (dependant on 
    guild level)
*** A lightsaber will act as a light source when ignited.

Skills that are darkside only will move a lightside Jedi towards
the darkside very quickly:
 
RAGE - if member is below 4/10 hps will triple attacks when
       used.  Like Luke going ballistic on Vader in 'Return of
       the Jedi'. (Non-Pk unless fighting another jedi)
CONFUSE - Temporarily drops wc and ac of opponent, has a chance
       of not working. (non-pk)
ENRAGE - Cause an opponent to attack any target you choose.
       (can make them attack pk set players, but not non-pk,
        also works on other jedi. Mainly usable on mobs vs.
        mobs)

Also, each jedi starts with a certain lightside pool of goodness,
they do not know how much they have at anytime. Each time one of
these extraordinary powers are used they fall closer to becoming
a Dark Jedi.
--------------------------------------------------------

Possible Jedi Powers:
Telekinesis(Both):
       Throw objects and do damage, damage depends on skill
       and weight of object thrown. Skill decides max 
       weight. Also lift objects in the air so that no one else can
       pick the item up

Soothe(Lightside only):
       Use the force to calm all fighting in the room.                 

Meditate(Both)
       Stop all actions but a mental tell and access to help
       files, regens hps and CP faster. Lightside regens 
       faster when using this.

Heal(lightside only):
       Heals while in or out of combat. If healing someone else
       must use out of combat.

Mind_reach <direction>(Both):
       Look into another room to see what is there, power of
       it and if aggressive.

Control_body(lightside only)
       Lowers intox levels(soaked,intox,stuffed), and cures
       poison. chance of success and amount of detox based
       on skill level.

Lightning(darkside only):
       The emperors ability to throw lightning from his
       hands. Great damage. Also temporarily lowers opponents ac.

Crush(darkside only):
       A good attack that acts like darth vaders signature move
       of crushing a persons larynx. If target is low enough
       will act as a deathblow move, killing them instantly.
       Deathblow and damage is dependent on skill level. Coupled 
       with lightsaber skill will increase chance of deathblow if
       victim is low enough on hp.

Aid(lightside only):                
       A lightside power that allows the user to lead a fight. When
       used the jedi reaches out and heals the person he is aiding and
       then leads. Level determines amount healed.       

Advance(darkside only):                 
      nearly the same as Aid, but leads the fight and does damage to
      the opponent. Level determines damage done.

Moonsault(Both):    
      A flip move that takes the jedi out of combat.

Lightsaber Skill(Both):
      Determines how many attacks can be blocked(lowers damage from
      each attack, maybe sometimes negating it) and the wc of the
      weapon. Maximum attacks blockable are equal to level.       

Reflect(Both):
      Will reflect attacks back at the attacker, doing partial damage
      from its original amount. Skill determines frequency of reflects.
      Automatically goes off, no control over when.

Punch/Kick(Both):
      Usable in conjuction with the lightsaber or without. Does decent
      damage.

Dodge(Both):
      Dodging attacks, frequency and chance based on skill level. 
      Automatically goes off, no control over when.

Vision(Both):
      See the room that a player is in through their eyes.

Hold(Both):
      Stuns an opponent and keeps them from leaving the room for a 
      few rounds. Skill determines success and number of rounds.

Secure_area(Both):
      Cast while in a room, for an x amount of rounds after that
      anything that enters will set off a mental alarm alerting the
      jedi that cast it.

Wound(Darkside only):
      A power that is related to the lightsaber. When it goes off, causes
      the mob or jedi hit to continue bleeding for a few extra rounds,
      doing an extra 1-6 damage per round. Number of rounds of bleeding 
      is determined by skill level.

Mtalk(Both):
      Allows a Jedi to send a mental image or message to someone. This
      is the only method of communication available while meditating.

Finish(Both):
      An automatic skill that finishes a mob or jedi when they get so
      low in hps. Finisher ability determined by skill level, higher
      level gives kill at higher hp range.

Throw(Both):
      Throw the lightsaber, hits everyone attacking the jedi. Can act
      as a finisher move also. Skill determines damage and accuracy.
      wc drops to unarmed combat for one round.

Steal_force(Darkside only):
      Allows the darkjedi to steal force from a corpse, gives 1 pt of
      CP for each.

Lightsaber moves:

Block: As Skill level increases can block more. For instance, a
       xetra attacks 6 times, if level is 6, can block all 6
       and limit damage to about half from each. A chance that
       an attack will also be completely negated can 
       occassionally occur(Slim chance, but based on skill level).
Reflect: 
     Occassionally reflects the attack back at the opponent.
     Rate of auto success depends on skill level.
Throw:
     A command that uses CP, throw works as a deathblow and if
     opponent is too high in hps does EXTREME damage to the
     opponent, OR all opponents attacking the Jedi. Damage for
     that round is reduced to 0 wc until Telekinesis is used to
     return the saber to the Jedi's hands.

[Potential Problems/Concerns]

    The hardest task in doing this guild will be keeping the balance
between the two sides.  Testing will be required for the theme end
of this guild, as well as the normal powers.  A lightside player should
be able to use the darkside on occasion but not blindly abuse the
powers without any risk.  The darkside player will have to notice
the effects of using the lightside abilitites enough so they only
are tempted to use them when in dire need.

    Weapon/Armor restriction can lead to boring game play.  I think
they are both necessary for the theme, and my hope is that the spells
and the guild theme will keep the players interested.
