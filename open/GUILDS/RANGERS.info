************************THE POWER RANGERS GUILD**************************


Theme:
     The Power Rangers Guild is loosly based on the Fox TV show.
     I have made several adaptations for game compatibility as well as fun.

     There are three basic concepts to my theme:
     The Power Rangers are inherently good.  There are penalties not for having
     negative alignment, but for trying to kill good creatures( see both morphed
     and combat section).
     The Power Rangers main ability is to morph his/herself.  When morphed
     the player aquires more powers and more restrictions.
     The third concept is the non use of sps for abilities.  All guild powers
     are used from a pool of points stored in the master object.  A player
     may transfer sps (with random loss) to power points and may donate objects 
     for a small percentage of their value.  With this system it is possible
     for a player to use powers without any of his/her own sps, but if the pool
     runs out, no guild members powers will work.
     This is not meant as a power guild...although the weapon combat should be
     decent as there are no nonstandard spells (missile, shock etc.)  The intent
     is more of a fun guild, with interesting training, and a sense of individuality
     as well as teamwork (to handle the power points pool).
     Each member chooses his own ranger color, as well as animal name, and
     thunderzord name.  They get a standard option when first joining, and
     I personally change them using my unique guild object, when they decide
     what they want and mail me about it.


How it is set up:
     All objects are in ~beck/rangers/ and all functions are in ~beck/rangers/cmds/.
     I have placed all the functions as well as the power points in a master 
     object.  Every action is called from this object.
     Each player carries a ranger communicator (auto-loading).
     At the start of play the communicator makes a ranger morpher and ranger 
     weapon.  The weapon is always carried and other weapons are dissallowed at 
     all times.  The morpher is used to morph the ranger.  see the morph command for
     more details.
     (*NEW*) A player is now not allowed to wear any extra armor.
             All armor_class bonus comes from /ranger/armor which is
             given to a player when they log in.
     There is a guild hall called the command center.  This can be accessed by
     any player on the mud though.
     (*NEW*)  Players do not automatically get functions.
              All Functions must be learned. When they are learned
              they are added to an array of availible commands which
              dictates the add_action()
     (*NEW*)  Players get offensive and defensive abilities which must
              be learned like any other skill.  each skill has a different 
              combat modifier.
              
Levels:
     Players will advance at /room/adv_guild as other players do.
     There are no set guild levels.  Powers are not based on levels either.


Combat:
     Combat is called from the ranger weapon.  Players all start as having a
     WC 10 weapon.  After this all additional bonuses are called in weapon_hit()
     and pro_hit() functions.  No additional hit_players() are being used at this
     time.
     A player recieves bonus damage for strength, will_power, and luck attributes.
     Also there is a bonus for when a player is morphed.
     The main combat bonuses come from the karate training (explained later).
     Since the power rangers normally dont use weapons. I keep the ranger_weapon
     invisible while a player is not morphed.  It shows a random martial arts attack.
     at all times.
     The low down:
     WC 10
     weapon_hit() bonuses
     str > random 80  +1
     wil > random 200 +1
     luc > random 500 +1
     morphed +4

     proficiency_hit() bonuses
     karate_level > random 30
     use an offensive attack skill that the player has learned

     Attack skills:
     Chop +1
    
     In the future players will be allowed to attack up to 3 npc at once
     when using their metallic armor bonus. (see armor function)

     (*NEW*)
     Defense is now a skill for the guild.  Armor is all called from
     /rangers/ranger_armor.c  This uses a paladin shield_bonus(ob)
     to calculate ac.  ac is modified by several different things.
     AC: 3
     Morphed +2
     Metalic armor +2
     if Karate Level > random 15
     random defensive skill modifier that player has learned.

     Defensive skills:
        Chop +1
        Backflip +1


Player Killing:
     Power Rangers are allowed to participate in PK but remain unprotected
     due to a lack of a guild hall.



Functions:
     These functions are broken down by whether a player can use them
     (morphed), (unmorphed), or (both).


     Morph (unmorphed)
     This Function allows a player to morph into a power ranger.
     It uses 100 power points each time.
     Also a ranger blaster and ranger coin are cloned.  The ranger weapon 
     becomes visible.  
     The ranger morpher is destructed.


     Unmorph (morphed)
     This function returns a player to the unmorphed state.
     It has no cost and destructs the ranger blaster, ranger coin, all 4 ranger
     armors, turns the ranger weapon invisible, and clones a ranger morpher.


     Generate (both)
     Allows a player to turn sps into power points.
     The formula is sps-20 + random(15) = power points.

     Donate (both)
     A function I put in to allow players extra donation power and to keep nirvana
     clean, as well as guild members gold down.  Players may donate any object in
     their inventory that can be dropped for power points.
     The formula is random(value/20) = power points.
     Any object with value above 1000 are considered = to 1000.
     The object is then destructed.


     Rt (both)
     The Power Ranger Talk Channel...Adapted from the Blade chat line by Saber.


     Rwho (both)
     A list of power rangers and npc rangers who are in the game.
     
     Time (both)
     Check the time to reboot.

     Ranger (both)
     Leads to the ranger help directory.


     Power (both)
     Check how much guild power there is at that moment.

     Blast (morphed)
     Called from the ranger blaster is give a player an additional hit
     during a round it is used.  It uses the spell_object() function in
     living.c with a cost of 10 power points per use.
     The max damage varies by level
     Lev 1-5 dam =5 6-10 dam =8 11-15 dam=10 15+ dam = 12
     A player must type 'blast' everytime they use it.  It is not automatic
     ever.

     Megazord (morphed)
     If there are 5 or more power rangers in a room one may call for the 
     thunder megazord (described later).  This command sets an integer to 1
     for all currently in the room and allows each to use the thunderzord command.

     Thunderzord (morphed)
     Once someone uses megazord, each of the 5 rangers must call thunderzord.
     This uses 100 power points per player, and sets an integer that shows the thunderzord
     has been called.  This command will not work if megazord has not been used.
     When the 5th player calls his thunderzord all 5 are moved to the thunder
     megazord onster which is cloned in that room.
     By adding the name of one of the other 6 npc rangers to the command you can
     force them to call their thunderzords and count as 1 of the 5 needed.
     Since the 6 are all located in different places it can only be used once.
     The npc ranger must already be morphed to work...it cost 50 sps.

     Morph (morphed)
     This (when already morphed) allows the player to make one of the six 
     npc power rangers morph by putting their name after the command.
     It costs 50 sps to do  NOT power points.


     Jet (morphed)
     This is the power rangers speedster.  It can only be used while players
     are morphed...to encourage them to remain morphed.  It can be used in 
     the standard directions (u,n,out,enter...etc) with a max of 5 commands
     per round.

     Teleport (morphed)
     The teleport is one of the rangers primary abilities.  A ranger is allowed
     to transport himself to special rooms and other power rangers.
     The cost is 25 power points per use. (A list of rooms is below).

     Teleport (unmorphed)
     same as above but cost is 50 power points per use.

             Rooms:
             Command Center /players/beck/room/headqtr
             Village Church /room/church
     
     *Note:  The teleport in its current form doesnt check for rooms that are
             NT.  Since this is meant as a major ability I would prefer not having
             to do this.  Or maybe a comprimise.  Check for NT if not morphed.
             No check while morphed.

     (*NEW*)
     Armor (morphed)
     This is the rangers metalic armor bonus.  When in battle is allows
     a +2 ac bonus but costs 2 power points per round.


Objects of interest:


     Thunder Megazord.
     This is one of the backbone's of the guild.  though I don't believe 
     it will be used much at first.
     The megazord is a monster (like a pet kinda) in which the players
     use from inside.
     Lev 20
     Hp 350
     Wc 30
     Ac 15
     spell chance 10%
     spell damage 10
     
     When players are inside the megazord (using thunderzord command)
     they have the ability to move to different rooms and attack other
     npc's.  When attacking each round every player inside receives
     damage equivelent to 1/3 of that the thunderzord receives, and exp
     = to 3* amount of damage the megazord's opponent recieves (or 3*exp
     the megazord gets.  The megazord uses 10 power points per round that
     it is used in battle.  If no guild power is left, the thunderzord is
     very weak, and players still receive damage, but gain no exp.
     If no players are left in the thunderzord is will destruct itself.
     Once created the only way out is by teleporting.
     *Soon to come...A way (costly) for players to heal it while in battle.
     *My tests show it dies very quickly.
      Only 1 megazord is allowed in the game at a given time.


Training:
     Training will be accomplished through martial arts training.
     Karate levels will be assigned belt colors.  For each belt color you
     need to know a certain number of moves/skills.  I have it so npc's as
     well as other players, and self training, are all incorporated in to how
     the player aquires these skills.
     There are 10 karate levels for a total cost of 4,000,000 exp to 
     aquire the skills.
     *note all is not completed in this area.  I may add small quests into 
     the training regiment as well as more skills as I feel are neccesary.
     The total cost will always be the same, but as i get more creative...the
     cost per skill will go down as more skills are added
     
     Current standard:
     Cost per karate level:
        Level 1         10,000
        Level 2         30,000
        Level 3         60,000
        Level 4        110,000
        Level 5        170,000
        Level 6        250,000
        Level 7        400,000
        Level 8        620,000
        Level 9        950,000
        Level 10     1,400,000

Disadvantages:
     The Rangers have many advantages but are balanced pretty well.
     The overall combat is not as strong or powerful as some other guilds.
     In fact at low levels the difference between power rangers and non-guild
     players is very small.
     When a ranger is morphed they are not capable of killing anything with 
     alignment greater than 0.  The only reason I did not restrict this to all
     times is so that players may still do quests where killing monsters with
     + alignments is neccessary.
     A player also does not have a speedster while unmorphed.  Thus to move quickly
     they must have be morphed which has a cost to it.  
     Right now I have nothing to prevent other speedsters form being attained.
     If I find this happening (like mythos' bought at vill_green) I will put
     something in to prevent this. (I'm sure I will end up having to do this.)
     A power ranger has no guild healing ability.  To heal they must use the
     standard portable or non portable heals.  I do this to avoid contreversy
     and player whining.
