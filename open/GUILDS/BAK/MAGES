The MAGES Guild  [Pavlik]
-------------------------
Overview:  The Mages guild is based on magic, of course.  And spell casting
is the soul and backbone of the guild.  Player Stats and Guild Stats
are extremely important in the calculations of spell casting.  Mercy
be to the unsuspecting Mage who miscasts a spell.

FILES:
------
Daemon: /players/pavlik/mages/mage-master.c
Guild Object: /players/pavlik/mages/mageobj.c
Spells: all spells are included by the master object.  the spells are all
        kept in the /players/pavlik/mages/spells/ directory
Advance: /players/pavlik/mages/rooms/advance_room.c

Advantages:
-----------
 1) The Mage's primary advantage is the enhanced performance of spells.
    Combat spells slightly exceed the 'normal' regulations for spells.
    Im general the following standards apply:
       1sp = random(2) damage    (normal = 1/1)
       3sp = 2 damage            (normal = 2/1)

 2) Mage's are allowed to go negative with spell points, however, a Mage
    with negative spell points will start to lose hit points.  The HP
    loss is dependent on the depth of the negative SPs:
        -500 or less = -10 HPs
        -300 or less = -5 HPs
        -100 or less = -2 HPs
         -10 or less = -1 HPs 

 3) I should also list the amount of spells avaliable as an advantage to
    the Guild.  Although a Mage will not be able to learn every spell
    listed they still will have more than the average allotment of spells.

 4) The primary pet, the DRAGON works like a mud-kid in that the pet can
    be increased in levels and become more powerful.  The player must use
    his/her own experience to advance the pets Attack/Defense and Level.

Disadvantages
-------------
 1) The Mage must train in 5 primary stats to become an effective spell
    caster.  Not training will result in numerous failed spells.
    The five primary guild stats are:
       Conjuration
       Enchantment
       Evocation
       Illusion
       Necromancy

 2) Spell casting can cut both ways - it is an advantage, however it is also
    a disadvantage.  All spells have the chance of failure.  Every spell is
    based on the players Guild Rank and a Primary stat.  Some spells also
    factor other stats, such as Intelligence or Will Power.  Miscast spells
    can either have absolutely no effect (except 1/2 the casting cost) and
    others miscast spells may backfire on the caster.  Spell Failure results
    are spell specific.
    A Player that keeps his stats high will usually have a 80% chance of
    success.  Lower level spells are always easier to cast for a Higher
    level guild member.  At least a 5% chance of spell failure will always 
    exist.  (there are some spells that do not have any chance of a fail, but
    these spells will have either a high casting time or a spell component)

 3) Spell Components and Casting Time: some of the more complex spells require
    a physical component or take a longer time to cast.  These spells are more
    difficult, but generally have a better result.
