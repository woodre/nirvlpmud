GUILD WEAPONS RULES                               mythos <8-13-1998>

This doc is written in response to the movement to encourage 
players to forage and use various weapons.

The term "guild weapon" is defined by the following:
   a weapon that exists (via spell, exists on a monster on the
   mud, guild object, etc) solely for members of a guild(s) 
   (i.e. excludes those not in said guild(s)). 
   
There are 4 types of guild weapons that this doc is concerned with:
   a> exclusive weapon
   b> non-exclusive weapon
   c> augmented weapon
   d> other
   
a> exclusive weapon
   This type of guild weapon prevents the player from utilizing
   other weapons (weapons found on monsters, treasures, etc).
   (note: the weapon may not prevent the player but this weapon
   is so intertwined with the guild theme that without this weapon
   the player would not consider herself part of said- thus 
   creating an "exclusive" item)
   The damage caused by said weapon is to be considered a guild 
   power- i.e. spell.  This damage should therefore have a cost.
   The cost is to follow the guidelines in the guild_spells doc as
   
   total_damage_considered_for_cost  
                               = 
                            total_damage - random(wc of the weapon)
   
   (there is a danger because the damage is tied to the weapon
   that everything becomes automated.  Let's avoid this.  TOO much
   automation is simply another huge step toward botting which is a
   no-no)
   (NOTE: all must be approved by a senior wiz) (also refer to 
   section <b> to view issues of wc) 

b> non-exclusive weapon
   This type of weapon does not prevent the player from using other
   weapons.  It is a "optional" weapon that a player can callup via
   spell or gain through some task.  Obviously the power of the 
   weapon should reflect how tough or costly it is to get it but as
   a general rule the weapon since it excludes other players from
   using it to its full potential should not exceed the damage 
   potential of wc 16 + return 5 (a tad under the max of a savable
   weapon). (again approval will allow for exceeding this limit)
   
c> augmented weapon
   This type of weapon is more a result of an ability.  The ability
   is to somehow "add" to the weapon (empowerment, wc increase, etc).
   This must be considered as a guild power and must be approved
   by a senior.
   
d> other
   This is to cover all other possibilties.  As with <c> they must be
   approved by a senior wiz.
