                      Guild Summary by Zeus
                        Updated: 4.19.02

  The fallen is primarily a spell based guild, and was coded with pk in
mind.  Each member is more of a rogue than part of a group, someone in
this guild has no more connection to someone else in the guild than
anyone else on Nirvana.  Many of the powers are based around 'shadow'
magics.
  While they are intended to be competitive in PK, many of the
disadvantages which they must deal with make them more targets than
anything else.  They start of extremely weak and do not gain back
the power which they lost when they joined until maybe 750k gxp, 
when they gain the weaken ability.
  This is a very difficult guild, and was coded with players who will
join it already having a vast knowledge of Nirvana in mind.  A 'true
newbie' would not have much of a chance at succeeding.

 Requirements for joining:

 1.  Must be at least level 10.


 Disadvantages (Major and Minor):

 1.  No mini guilds.
 2.  No guild channel or general player location abilities.
 3.  No shield type armor.
 4.  No main armor > weight 2, no other armors > weight 1.
 5.  Cannot wield a weapon until 5mil gxp.
 6.  No spells work in darkness.  Sps drain in darkness.
 7.  Many spells require Sps and Hps, as well as a component(ranging in cost
     from 100 to 6000 coins)
 8.  If other guild members in room, 1:3 drain 2-6 sps per member > 1.
 9.  If spell points drop below 0-15, hp are moved to sp at a 5:1 ratio.
 10. Spell failure.
 11. Log into random room in Fallen Lands.  Possibility of agros.
 12. Cost to max in guild is 8000000 xp
 13. Endurance.  [see note 8]
 

 Advantages:

 1.  Gain a max of 26 on magic and 30 stealth.
 2.  Sps regen faster [very nice] (see note 9)
 3.  Can lower ac of enemy, and have a powerful main attack spell.
 4.  Can do very impressive damage.


 Notes:

 1.  No spells prevent player from going negative, however if sps drop below
     0-15, as many hps as the player has will be moved to sp until they have
     15 sp again at a 5 to 1 ratio.

 2.  Almost all hp and sp costs can kill the player.

 3.  The Fallen Lands is their 'home' however it is anything but hospitable.
     Movement can and will clone fierce demons which attack the player.  It
     is all open, including the guild hall, so there is no place for them
     to be safe.  Logging out w/ low hps is a -very- bad idea.  Movement in
     the area checks hps, and clones demons based on hps.  If a player has
     below 50% health, the chances are 1:3 that a demon will come.  The
     guild hall is located south of path4.c in the /city dir.

 3.  Some of the spells require that a component be bought beforehand.
     Components are carried in a special pouch: ~/zeus/circle/OBJ/pouch.c
     When components are purchased, variables are set within the pouch, so
     it is not a container.	 The pouch and its components do not save over 
     a reboot, so the player is not able to 'stockpile' components.  All
     components bought from g-old.c in ~/realm/NPC dir.  Components are
     essentially an added coin cost to spells, plus it forces them to think
     ahead about which spells they will need to cast.

 4.  This guild is based with PK in mind, there is no guild unity at all,
     and while they are not punished for working together, it is in no way
     encouraged.  I leave it up to the players to decide their roles.

 5.  They wield the guild object, which has a base wc of 3, however they have
     a spell, 'focus' which allows them to raise it for short periods of time.
     The max wc is 21, however the best possible average is about 14.  Once
     5 mil gxp is reached, they can wield any weapon they weave.  Weaving a
     weapon gives it a few small bonuses and additional emotes.

 6.  The player can set the amount of xp to go into the guild for each kill.
     Either 20, 50 or 80 percent [low medium or high].

 7.  The mudspells were redone.  Cost are level and gxp based.  Damage
     is primarily gxp based, but also has a few level checks.  Max damage
     is equal to sonic.  Spell messages based on damage done.

 8.  Endurance:
     The player has a set amount of endurance, dependant on stealth,
     level and guild xp.  Most spells have an endurance cost.  While
     in combat, endurance does not increase.  Outside of combat,
     endurance increases.  Max endurance ranges from 25 to 80.
     If endurance drops below 0, [it can go to -100]:
       * all spells cost 5 sps more to cast,
       * the player loses 1 sp a hb,
       * wc of guild ob is very limited, and 
       * when combat ends, the player takes the negative endurance
         factor in damage, which also sets endurance back to 0.
     Endurance is a constant annoyance for everyone in the guild, as
     it forces them to fight slower than they otherwise would need to.
     Some abilities give small endurance bonuses.

  9. Sps regen rate increases, with a 1 in 3 chance to gain 
     1+random(guild_exp / 1600000) in hb [1-5]

 10. They have their own little 'chat box' built into each guild object.
     It does not use a daemon.  They can not use this to speak to other
     guild members, and other players may only be in one 'chat' at a time.

 11. They occasionally have 'nightmares' after they login.  They depict
     events of when the curse was cast upon the Fallen Lands.  They have
     a negative effect of draining the player of all sps, but can not
     occur while in combat.

 12. 'who2' was recoded so that it does not show player locations, and they
     are blocked from using the 's_who' ability.  However they will still
     be able to use the 'ppl' command, if they get a MK scar.  Any future
     who commands that display player location, I would want to have a
     check for this guild.
