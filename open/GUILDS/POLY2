LAST MINUTE CHANGES & ADDITIONS:

The single_attack() spellcast formula was illegal so it was changed to
a proper setting of:

damage = random ( damage )
cost = damage
where damage cannot exceed 50 per round.



The tetrapod's weapon wielding system  could not pass weapon->weapon_class()
for some odd reason so damage is now:  random( 3/4 player's level)
regardless of what kind of weapon the player is strapped.


Blobels have a spell 'dreamscape' in /players/mizan/closed/poly/blobel.c
under function blobel_dreamscape() which allows the player to eavesdrop
on all guild channels for 55 + random(20) heartbeats.
It costs 60 sp.


Wombats can retaliate in combat, and wield weapons.
