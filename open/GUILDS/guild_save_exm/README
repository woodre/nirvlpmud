These are a couple files about saving guild stats, or variables from any object,
in a file in your directory.
   Teh functions are: 
     restore_object(filename);
     save_object(filename);

   These functions create ( save_object() ) or read from ( restore_object() )
a file all variables ( with the exception of those declared static; see 
"var_int" ) in the file named.  The file will be given a suffix ".o".
   Syntax:  There cannot be a leading "/" in the filename, but the name 
            should be absolute.
            The ".o" suffix should also not be included in the filename for
            either case.
