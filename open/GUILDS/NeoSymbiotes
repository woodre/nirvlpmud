                           [NEO SYMBIOTES]

The new symbiotes are more in touch with what the mud needs
for its players, the ability to use weps and armor and be 
more party oriented.

ADVANCEMENT:

This is an extension of the first Symbiote guild. The first
step is to defeat your symbiote, which is a powerful mob
that, if you lose, you are removed from the guild.
Symbiotic Mob Stats:
Hps 900
WC  Varies (Uses the symbiote gob to calculate wc and ac)
AC  Varies
Specials:  Uses Hypermode, webslam, and web.
Average Xp value of this mob was between 60k - 90k

This mob must be defeated without the use of guild powers,
leaving only game spells, armor, and weps.

After coming into the guild, advancement is in 16 levels,
each at 100k xp.  
Each level will give 1 pt to spend in skills.
skills are broken down into 3 categories:
 combat
 control
 creation
each skill type has 6 levels = 18 total. However, they
only get to spend 16, meaning 2 levels are left out.



POWERS:

Combat:
LVL: NAME:   COST:     DESCRIPTION:
 1   Wep     15sps    Damage = random(11) + 10

                      Cost = combat * 3 + 1 mp
     NOTE: Darts only works from the backline. A direct attack will
           prevent its use.

                       it of the mob. Non-pk.  This body will allow
                       the symbiote to do other things.

                          4 ac.
 2   alarm       5mp      creates an alarm that waits in a room and
                          notifies the symbiote of when someone enters.

                                  See: creationball.c in OBJ/
 6   Createball  50sp+50mp        Creates a ball that can be used as a
                                  heal, attack spell, web spell, or to
                                  transfer mp from one symb to another.
 
Control:
 1   Cleanse    20 sps      destroys poison
 2   absorbi    ------      gives up to 6 mp per item, based on weight.
 3   For future use.
 4   Heal       5:6 ratio of healing(sps to hps)
 4   Gtitle     set your color guild title.
 5   burnoff    Same as Symbiotes of old.
 6   regeneration  10sps + 1mp  gives 1:1
 
Control/Combat:
 3/3 Feed       Drains a KO'd mobs body over time. Give 3x's the
                amount in hps/sps.
 5/5 suffocate  30sps + 5mp  can begin at 3/10 and do damage over the
                             span of the fight. Damage = r(3) + 3 damage

Creation/Combat:
 5/5 Block      15sps     Gives 5 + r(combat) in ac for 1 round.
 6/6 Dominate   100sps + 100mp  Creates a pet from the KO'd body of a mob.
                                See: OBJ/pet.c  (this is a weak pet, but
                                hey)

Auto Powers:
Absorb  -  Same as old Symbiotes
Threat  -   "    "  "   "
Tentacles -  10 tentacles that can be placed into attack, defend, regen,
             or burnoff.  The more in one place, the better, but weakening
             the others.
Lair - Level 16, requires 5000sp, 5000mp, and 1 million coins. Can be
       placed in about any place outside the village and becomes their
       guild hall.  OBJ/cave.c


When fighting, it will be more common for a symbiote to put 5 tentacles into
defense, and 5 into attack.  This will balance for defense and attack. Other-
wise, it would be more like the cyber attack mode if all 10 in attack, with
some good damage but low low defense.  On the other hand, going 10 defend
will not equal up to cybers defense mode.
