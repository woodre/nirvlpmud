REBOOT
MONSTER EXP

DEATH EXP LOSS

TOP PLAYER POWER


These all go together. If possible, reboots should happen once
every few days, rather than once every few hours. Monsters should
not have an exp limit (i.e. Icingdeath should not give
the same exp as a qurd). Players should not lose so much exp on death
(Though if tough monster exp went up, death losses might not be so bad
for high levels). Tough monsters should not be killable by low level players - players with 15million exp
invested should be able to fight tough monsters. This is all scale stuff of course.
If monster exp went up, top exp expenditures could go up, monsters could get really badass (parties worthwhile), healers could also be useful (should remove the heal tox).
