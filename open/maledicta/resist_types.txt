         [ Listing of Resistances and Damage types ]

  The following is a list of resistance types that will 
apply to armor, mobs, spells, weapons, etc. This list will 
categorize the types and standardize them for all of the 
wizards to use.  I have listed examples alongside the type 
to help cover questions that might arise with where a damage 
type or resistancebelongs. This is NOT an instructional guide 
to using the code, but is a supplement to what to use when 
setting a type.

Type:
Heat     - fire, laser, light
Cold     - ice, undead touch 
Poison   - venom, gas clouds, acid
Spirit   - psionics, holy attacks, mental, exhaustion
Electric - lightning, tazer gun, stun, energy
Magical  - darkness, mana, general spells 
Physical - punch, kick, being struck by wind, falling, water 

  This is not a complete list; the possibilities will be
limitless.  You must place an attack type within these
guidelines though, even if it is a stretch.  Otherwise,
players will not be able to prepare against it and will
be confused by a non standard type.
