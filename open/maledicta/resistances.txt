[Armor Resistances]


The key to creating resistances in armor is to allow for
a moderate amount of protection, but not to make the
player character too powerful when fighting something.
Therefore, I suggest capping resistance at 60% per
type.  This will protect for a little over half the
damage, and make it worthwhile for the player to go
out and find armors that will assist them.  To reach
this, I suggest the following numbers:
                    
Armor Type:    Max Resist:   Max # of resists:
armor             9                 1
shield            7                 1
ring              12                2
amulet            12                2
boots             6                 1
helmet            7                 1
misc              7                 1

Max Resist: 
 This is the maximum amount of resistance for that type
 of armor. It is not possible to go over this amount and
 the average should be 50% of the amount indicated. The
 maximum should be rare and probably non storable.

Max # of resists:
 This is the maximum number of resistances a piece of
 armor may have. Amulet and ring are the only pieces of
 armor which may have up to 2 resistances (for example
 heat and cold)  This is NOT necessary and should be as
 rare as getting a max resistance amount.
