~*~Mizan~*~: Is this a common problem?
~*~Armadillo~*~: yes
~*~Mizan~*~: Should i reinstall the OS?
~*~Armadillo~*~: Depends.  How old is the hardware?
~*~Star~*~: You guys are horrible
~*~Mizan~*~: It's not under warranty anymore...
~*~Illarion~*~: I think you'll find she's incompatible with every possible device you might use to reinstall the OS
~*~Armadillo~*~: Might be time to upgrade. Maybe get the extended warranty this year.
~*~Armadillo~*~: err....this time
~*~Mizan~*~: It's really loud in here.. wait, can you repeat that please?
~*~Mizan~*~: Extended... upgrade? sorry.
~*~Armadillo~*~: Sounds like her motherboard is on the verge of a meltdown. Definitely time to replace it with a newer model.
~*~Mizan~*~: Something is definitely wrong, i am being subjected to even louder noise.
~*~Mizan~*~: I said something about 'upgrade' and 'I work in a university' and 'I am surrounded by younger versionsand easily impressionable copies of yourself'
~*~Mizan~*~: Help help tech support
~*~Mizan~*~: I am on fire, and bleedin
