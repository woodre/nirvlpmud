You missed periods at the end of almost all, or maybe
all, of your item descs.
Most of these changes are to add item descs.  Someone
once told me that no one ever looks, but some players
do when exploring a new area.
One of your testers told me the zombies follow, but
very slowly.  I told him I think they're slow on
purpose because they're zombies, but he says even for
zombies there's such a thing as too slow..  laff

In reanimate_corpse2, default the same thing for the
eyes snapping open.

Does the swamp come near to the village at all?  The
first mention of it is in the desc for the forest.
I was wondering if it's meant to be there, or if you
copied in some of the wrong items..  *8)  If the
swamp does not get near the village, then feel free
to take it out of the forest desc and ignore any of
the following nouns that have to do with it.
