A player, through inappropriate behavior or breaking of the rules (help rules)
may be imprisoned by a Wizard.  Inappropriate behavior includes, but is not
limited to, harrassment of other playres or wizards, spamming, or being a general
'nuisance'.  Use your brain.  If you have enough smarts to log on and type and read,
you have enough sense to know what is right or wrong.  When in doubt, ask a Wizard, or
simply DON'T DO IT.  If you are warned to stop doing something, stop it. It is not up
to YOU to decide if your actions are harassing, its up to everyone around you and any
wizards loged on.

If you have an issue, don't immediatly mail or send a tell to Boltar or just a random
Wizard.  Read 'help rule_wizards' for a list of Wizards who's responsibility it is to
take care of such matters.  If you have an immediate concern that must be fixed right
away, please tell a wiz on to stop the behavior, and then mail the appropriate Wizards
mentioned above.  The wiz you called on as a stopgap will also mail the group with what
he/she witnessed.

If you are sent to jail, you may log on another character.  That character, however,
will have special rules attached to him/her. Those rules are as follows:
1. You may ASK ONCE to the Wizard who jailed you WHY. Do NOT reply to their answer in
   any way.  The purpose of this isn't for a debate, its for information on your part.
2. During a cool-off period of 2 hours, you may not send tells or use ANY channel, nor
   can you use 'say' or emotes, etc (no communication basically) in the same room as
   ANYONE involved in the situation.  You may 'reply' to tells.  If someone asks on a
   channel to you, you may, on that channel, inform them that you cannot communicate on
   that channel for 2 hours. Failure to abide by this will result in the first character
   brought on being jailed, the third will be dested as will any that follows.
3. You may mail the wizards listed in help rule_wizards with any information you feel
   mightur cause. (witnesses, explinations, etc.)
4. When the cool-off period is over, you may again use channels freely. However, do NOT
   bring up the situation that had your other character jailed, and do not try to start
   something new with the same person or group of people.

When you submit claims to the rules Wizards, trust that it is being taken care of. When
the situation is resolved, either way, you will receive a mail stating what was decided
and why.  If you disagree with their findings, you may appeal to the higher court. If
they again decide against you, you must get permission from them to appeal to Boltar. Your
first appeal is granted to you, the second doesn't need to be. Spamming Wizards asking
the status of the case, or with claims that do not warrant it, will only bog the whole
process down.  Please use common sense.

Minimum sentances are as follows:
 

1st offense:  1 week  
2nd offense:  1 month
3rd offense:  3 months
4th offense:  1 year
5th offense:  life or banishment
 
These are MINIMUM sentences. The severity may be increased due to the
nature of the offense, past history, or simply the players attitude.
While the 3rd offense is listed at 3 months, it is likely that most
players who will likely have gone through numerous warnings will
end up with the life/banishment sentence.
