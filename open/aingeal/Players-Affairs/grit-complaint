As you look around you notice that there isn't much to
this room.  It's actually rather secluded from the rest
of the mud.  Perhaps this is why Puppy decided to make
it his home.  Everything in the room seems quite bland
except for a tattered blanket on one side of the room
and a small bowl that you should not touch.  You see a
small stream of water trickling down the wall.
    No obvious exits.
