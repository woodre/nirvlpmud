Original Mailing to Puppy:

From: hugh
Subj: symbio

This mail is in reguards to symbio And what i feel is harassment.  
I've been sworn at by him many times.  The various fuck you's, the way i do things, and even being called saddam.

I feel that anything he says to me is rude, hateful, and spiteful.  And any time he sends me a tell it has one if not all of those qualities, plus obsenities.  Quite frankly Anytime he talks to me I lose all interest in the game.  I've taken so much shit from him I've had it.

So after 3 tells from him, I told him to stop sending me tells and that any thing he said could be directed to me from a wizard.

I feel that is my only recourse to stop him from harassing me.
Thank you for your time
Hugh
