		Log of conduct (see /open/aingeal/decisions/logs/blade-multiplaying)


Substance of offense and Wizard's findings of fact:
Blade brought four "Air" weapons to green and placed all four of them
in the donation box, then logged out of the game.  Less than ten seconds
later, Starfire, another of Blade's characters, logged on, came to green,
and took the four "Air" weapons from the donation box and left. Total
elapsed time between Blade placing the weapons in the box and Starfire
removing them from the box was less than sixty seconds.  Martha and
Feyth (Aingeal) were both at green and witnessed the activity.  Martha
reported the incident to Feyth (Aingeal).  Feyth (Aingeal) copied the 
log of the incident.

When confronted with the incident, Blade said that "one of his friends"
hacked his machine from a remote location, logged Starfire on, and took 
the weapons from the donation box.  A log of the investigation is copied
at /open/aingeal/decisions/logs/blade-multiplaying-investigation.

Decision:
Blade was multiplaying in violation of Nirvana rules.

Penalty:
Aingeal issued a warning and told Blade that Starfire would be forced to
forfeit the four weapons.  Aingeal further told Blade that this is his one
and only warning for multiplaying, and that the next infraction would 
result in imprisonment.  Aingeal also advised Blade that he has the right
to appeal her decision.

Note:  As soon as Aingeal told Blade the penalty, he went inactive, then
logged Starfire on literally only long enough to make Starfire inactive.
Aingeal has been unable to mail Blade a written summary of the findings
and the decision because he is inactive, and has been unable as of the
date of the decision to impose the penalty.
