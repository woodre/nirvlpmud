Hello, Cloud was deleted from the game from lack of activity i believe
I was wondering if i could reinstate him back before he was deleted.
The last time i can remember playing him before the deletion was
somewhere between june 2002 - early 2003.
Could you please contact me about what can be done.
Thank You Very Much, 
Cloud

Howdys. This is just a heads up. I imprisoned pan and uriel tonight because
they appeared to have been one person playing two characters. I have a long
screen cap but without seeing the timing between the two character's command
sequences it kind of doesn't do the full justice of it.

Oh well. To make a long story short here is the chain of events.

I login. Puppy suspects that Uriel and Pan might be the same person because
of the slow command cycles, and IP address.

We realize that this is the IP that Kezef and Whitewolf (their primaries)
login from.

I ghetto-snoop them and watch their commands for a while. Fairly slow words
per minute, and lots of random little mistakes that match the confusion of
one person playing two chars. This happened for perhaps 10-15 minutes.

I goto them, and just sit in the room watching. I start talking with both
of them at once and explain i am not convinced they are two people. Words per
minute are still very slow and broken.

I tell them i don't buy the act and imprison both characters (uriel, pan).

Kezef (uriel) logs back in and starts to complain. Still fairly low words per
minute, and Whitewolf (pan) doesn't login until i wonder why only one person
is there.

Words per minute go through the roof. At this point it looks clear that there
are two people logged in.

After seeing for some time that there is definitely two people on at once, i
tell them both that i am going to release both characters in the AM (28 oct).

I tried telling them that having no less than 15 chars and partying them
together is not a great way to get on the good side of wizards who 'p h'.

If you have any suggestions on dealing with this or what the new policies are
please let me know. Luckily nothing got out of hand, there was no violence
from either side other than me imprisoning their chars.

Yes, it is possible that they were multitasking, i.e. watching TV while playing
and goofing around. But to not take it seriously when a wizard arrives and another
is asking them what is going on, that's just reckless. 

A little background story- Kezef and Whitewolf share the same place.
Some of the other chars that originate as theirs:
roc, softwind, mordrin, uriel, maxy, halo, ironman, creep, minsc, angle,
pan, skittles, whitewolf, kezef, fawn.

Thanks for reading.

Is the a rule about logging jailings if there is why wasn't pan and uriel reason logged also we proved that we were not multiplaying yet we were still jailed i even gave a alternative to prove we weren't multiplaying and it fell on death ears.  Mizan is starting up which hunts and i don't like it just because we work off the same line doesn't mean we multiplay its 2 computers 1 connection.
  I was useing my healer he was basing his desision on one incident when i gave coins to my self if he would of looked he would of saw i had coins in my inventory but no he thought ti was a typo and jailed us for it Mizan needs to learn that theres been alot of changes since he left like INVENTORY COINS when you max at 80k.  Intill hes familar with these changes he shouldn't be allowed to jail anyone one.  And if there isn't a rule about jail people and logging it there should be if they break the rule they should be demoted and the person released.  And just because the person isn't killing like mad doesn't mean they are multiplaying i was accaully watching a tv show cooking supper all while i was healing pan so ofcorse my playing will be choppy.  There are my wizards on here that know that WW and I run off the same connection but different PCs that should be taken into consideration too.
  The jailed chars were Uriel and Pan
Kezef
