halo mizan Nice!  Do you care if I swipe the object and play with it a bit?  I'll let Boltar know that I have it, and obviously I won't abuse it.  I've had so many complaints about Kezef harassing people that, frankly, he needs to be watched.

Twig tells you: Can I be of some assistance here since I had a char on that
night and was partying with him?

haloe mizan nods, "I think so too.  Some might abuse it, it's always a danger....but it sure would come in handy in my job.  You wouldn't believe the stories that some of the players try to feed me!"

->> Twig tells you: Well, we were partying when someone said something to him
and he got the chars mixed up when he answered, but didn't
intensionally say anything to Passion. It was a mistake and
he said so at the time to her.

being spoken to while you are fighting, I know because I do
the same thing.

Kezef tells you: ok if you do jail me please right down my stats and mail it
to boltar and when i'm getting out becasue for some reason

halo mizan Oh, I love it.  Twig just sent me a tell to support Kezef.....he should have worked harder to get the story coordinated.

halo kezef I have Passion's log, and I also have Twig's version of what happened (which is different from yours, by the way.  He said you made a typo in replying to someone, a mistell, rather than you thought someone else owned Passion's character.)
