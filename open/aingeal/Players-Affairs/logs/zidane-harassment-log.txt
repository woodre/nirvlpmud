General Jadeite Zidane the General of the Negaverse. (neutral) (disconnected) (female).
Zidane is dressed in an entirely black ensemble. His collared shirt tight around his masculine arms, his pants over his firm legs. The Executives black cap, white leather gloves, white boots and white belt complete, refined and masculine look...an aura of trepidation hypnotizes the room upon the Executives entrance. This exquisite conquerer's quests outnumber those of the greatest ones. His reaction is swift as wind and his armor as strong as dragon scales. He rides a silver dragon, a great silver dragon. He wears a black leather trenchcoat on the rest of his black and white clothing. He has a pair of long, red, soft feathered wings which also catches your attention. Do not take his company lightly, for you are in the very presence of a sinister, evil, sadistic and insane man with no sanity at all....he pushes his small framed glasses up the bridge of his nose, smirks, points at you with a gun gesture and says "Bang, you're dead..."


Zidane is a human, 5 feet 2 inches tall, 107 lbs.
Zidane is in good shape.
Zidane has an air of flamboyance about her.
Zidane has a small gold star tattoo on her inside right ankle.
Zidane has a long tail and whiskers.

        Zidane is carrying:
A gold wedding band (Blackrose) (worn).
A hotel key card.
The scabbard of a dueling knife.
A ball 'o string.

  This is the innermost room of Aingeal's Cloud.  It is lined with mahogany
bookshelves containing esoteric texts from distant lands.  Against
one wall is an antique mahogany desk neatly stacked with ancient scrolls.
A large brick fireplace dominates the opposite wall, its broad, polished
stone mantle supporting a magnificent crystal longsword that glitters
brilliantly with the red and gold reflections of the merry fire as it dances
in the hearth.  Two overstuffed leather armchairs of deepest ebony
rest comfortably before the fireplace, separated by a small mahogany end
table.  A plush, wooly rug of light beige warms itself upon the floor before
the fireplace.  In the relative shadows to the east of the fireplace rests
a long couch, matching the leather chairs in every detail.  To the west
is the cool expanse of a picture window, complete with padded window
seat, that looks out upon the countryside below.  Tucked away in one
corner is hidden an azure portal, and the center of the room holds a 
mirror-like reflecting pool that is as smooth and still as glass.
    There are no obvious exits:
Ok.
