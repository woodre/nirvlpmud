After reviewing all of the evidence contained in the log provided
by Katya, and upon determining that this is the first recorded 
offense by Khrell / Mortarion, I am going to make Mortarion's
prison sentence ONE WEEK from the date he was imprisoned.  I am 
also going to require that he turn over the Katana as soon as he 
is released, and I will destroy it.

My reasons for imposing the maximum 
first-offense sentence are: 
   1) Khrell / Mortarion knew that his action was a violation of 
   the rules, and was specifically warned to not do what he did 
   by Katya literally moments before he took an Ancient Ninja
   Katana out of Khrell's locker, dropped it on Lance Road, 
   logged Khrell out, then logged Mortarion in and went to retrieve
   the Katana from where Khrell had left it.
   2) Khrell / Mortarion acknowledged that this act was a violation
   of the rules, and exhibited no remorse whatsoever.  He merely
   replied that "everyone does it".
   3) Khrell is reputedly attempting to wiz.  This demonstrates 
   very poor behavior for someone who wishes to hold a position
   of wiz on this Mud, and does not speak well of his capacity 
   or willingness to follow the rules or to acede to the wishes 
   of those in authority over him, should he ultimately qualify 
   to become a wizard and find the appropriate sponsor(s).

I provided a copy of this to Khrell and Mortarion via mudmail today.
