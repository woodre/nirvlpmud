After reviewing all of the evidence contained in the log provided
by Katya, and upon determining that this is the first recorded 
offense by Khrell / Mortarion, I am going to make Mortarion's
prison sentence ONE WEEK.  My reasons for imposing the maximum 
first-offense sentence are: 
   1) Khrell / Mortarion knew that his action was a violation of 
   the rules, and was specifically warned to not do what he did 
   by Katya literally moments before he took an Ancient Ninja
   Katana out of Khrell's locker, dropped it on Lance Road, 
   logged Khrell out, then logged Mortarion in and went to retrieve
   the Katana from where Khrell had left it.
   2) Khrell / Mortarion acknowledged that this act was a violation
   of the rules, and exhibited no remorse whatsoever.  He merely
   replied that "everyone does it".
   3) Khrell is reputedly attempting to wiz.  This demonstrates 
   very poor behavior for someone who wishes to hold a position
   of wiz on this Mud.

I am also instructing Mortarion to turn over the Katana as soon
as he is released, and it will be destroyed.

I sent Khrell and Mortarion a copy of this decision today.
