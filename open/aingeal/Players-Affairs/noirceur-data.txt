mizan should be sending you a log of data's misconduct.
pulling a prank on a wizard or his test character is one thing, setting aggressive monsters to kill someone's character is
definitely over the line.
either you deal with him or i will, and he won't like what i do to him.

The purpose of this log is to record all wizard-made commands to the
monster's guild. It is a little cryptic, and is missing one key piece of
info- namely the type of monster being ordered, but in this particular
case I had been watching over the radio. Here is the snippet...

Now all of the previous monsters were Beanos for the most part. But the last
line, 'order 5 harrass noirceur' was a fully pumped Karate Normal Man.
Noirceur claims it attacked him, and i cannot verify that. KNM is not an
aggressive monster, but he was very pimped out on heals at the time, so
a realistic possibility is that Noirceur attacked it, realized how strong
it was, and quit out.
According to /log/ENTER at the time, Data quit out of the game immediately
after issuing this order.

I will be modifying the log output to contain more details...

If you scan through the contents of the full /log/mizan.orders.log file,
you will notice a lot of other wizzes are issuing monster harrass (i know,
just one R:) orders. I happened to be around for most of those and they 
almost exclusively involved Beanos. You will also note that Data is the
most prolific user of the command sets...
