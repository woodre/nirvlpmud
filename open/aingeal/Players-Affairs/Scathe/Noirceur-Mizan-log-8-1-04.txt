You tell Mizan and that was the decision i was asking about, if i'd be informed/advised.
Mizan tells you: i have no idea what decision you are talking about.
You tell Mizan i was banished.
You tell Mizan which is new since i logged in around 8pm mudtime and was still a wizard.
->> Mizan tells you: so, uh, i dont get it
You tell Mizan don't get what?
Mizan tells you: nothing.
Mizan tells you: So you're telling me that you did NOTHING to deserve this?
You tell Mizan apparently desting a wizard twice.
You tell Mizan since i've been dested far more often than that, no, i don't think i did.
You tell Mizan yes.
->> Mizan tells you: who did you dest twice?
You tell Mizan i thought you knew?
Mizan tells you: and why? that's kinda odd
Mizan tells you: no, i dont know what you're talking about
You tell Mizan then what was aingeal talking about earlier?
->> Mizan tells you: who did you dest twice, and why?
You tell Mizan hogath, for emoting to noirceur some rather tasteless things.
Mizan tells you: What kinda emotes?
Mizan tells you: like the kind you always send me?
You tell Mizan you didn't hear about this?
You tell Mizan no, i don't nibble on your ear or moan at you.
->> Mizan tells you: You emote me random slop all the time though
Mizan tells you: i've never dested you for it
You tell Mizan yes, but it's usually nothing along those lines.
You tell Mizan okay, so then what was i banished for if i may ask?
->> Mizan tells you: you've nibbled, and moaned at me for no reason
You tell Mizan uh, no way.
Mizan tells you: so i dont see why you went lance armstrong about it
Mizan tells you: i can search my logs :)
You tell Mizan i've never done either towards you that i can ever remember.
You tell Mizan go ahead.
Mizan tells you: i see lots of pokes in the ribs, eyeball jabs, some groping, moaning, and a fondle or two
Mizan tells you: hypocrite :)
Mizan tells you: i've never dested you though, so i dunno why you went all Jay Leno on hogath
You tell Mizan i groped or fondled you?!?  i'd think i'd remember something as horrifying as that.
Mizan tells you: i think you're turning all herbert hoover on me here
You tell Mizan so what was i banished for?
Mizan tells you: i dunno, what were you banished for?
You tell Mizan i don't know, that's what i'm asking you.
->> Mizan tells you: i think you went all donny osmond on us
Mizan tells you: well, i figured you would know, so i am perplexed why you're asking me
You tell Mizan no, i don't.
->> Mizan tells you: i can only think of about three wizzes who got dick cheney'ed
Mizan tells you: and it was for some pretty severe kinky shit
Mizan tells you: vulture got bob doled for cheating, pogg got roger moored for the same
Mizan tells you: and ladyfinger got persephoned for handing the char away
Mizan tells you: so i figure since you're in that club you would know what you did
Mizan pokes you in the ribs from afar.
->> Mizan tells you: come to think of it, i never emoted anything more severe than a poke at you
Mizan pokes you in the ribs from afar.
->> Mizan tells you: i suppose i would have dested too for a moan
Mizan begins to moan at you from afar.
