Stardream says: dirty dogs

Mizan grins evilly.
Khrell jumps up and slobbers all over Stardream's face!
Mizan says: so i guess you guys are all on the same page...
Khrell nods solemnly.
Stardream says: I'd have to say so, yes

'I completely agree that he should be dewizzed.....and he needs to be sent a hard message.
You say: I completely agree that he should be dewizzed.....and he
needs to be sent a hard message.

->> Stardream says: we all have our own grievances

Mizan says: so the only missing part was my conv with aingeal
Mizan nods solemnly.
Mizan says: ok, in a nutshell... what i think the punishment should be
is- instant de wiz
'I agree with that.
You say: I agree with that.

->> Mizan says: NO chance of return as a wiz, he has had enough chances
Khrell nods solemnly.
'Again, agreed.
You say: Again, agreed.

->> Mizan says: option to retain his code or have it removed, his
discretion
Khrell says: no arguements here.

Mizan says: his main char (noirceur) outed
Stardream says: nod, I think even Verte would agree with that, he just
wanted to wait for everyone else to agree

Mizan says: and a PERMANENT note in the village green:
'This is a creative idea....and I like it.
You say: This is a creative idea....and I like it.

->> Mizan says: saying why he was de wizzed, listing noirceur as well, and
indicating that we dont take shit for this kind of harrassment
~*~Hedren~*~: SNATCH AND RUN!
~*~Thomas~*~: lol
Mizan says: and an apology to those who were affected in the past and
felt that they were let down by admins here
Mizan says: plain and simple at that. i think that he is easy to track
in terms of new char login
Mizan says: so i would rather not siteban him altogether.
Hedren tells you: can i visit the soft fluffy cloud too?

Hedren grins evilly at you from afar.
->> Hedren hugs you from afar.
->> Mizan says: and lastly...
Khrell says: Siteban is a bit extreme.

Mizan says: i would have no problems writing a draft of that note
Mizan says: and putting my name behind the finished product
'As Stardream and I were discussing, it's almost been a dirty little secret for so, so long.  He effectively prevented most of the women he treated this way from comparing notes with one another.

You tell Hedren: We're doing some stuffy wiz stuff, hon....but later, yes.

->> Khrell says: Maybe mizan should be a PA or at least an assistant PA

Khrell nudges Mizan.
Mizan says: i dont think i should take that role
Khrell says: He does ALOT of work seemingly when there is no other
authority abouts.

Mizan says: in fact i think i work better when not aligned to any
resolved interests
emote chuckles.  "He practically is......but I agree.  He very quietly investigates things to help the PA's, and is invaluable to us."

Stardream says: perhaps, what could happen, is that it could be a
coauthorship.... one person writes, others add to or edit
things

~*~Thomas~*~: hit after me

~*~Hedren~*~: talk about some annoying scrap metal
~*~Thomas~*~: lol
~*~Hedren~*~: heh
Mizan says: i definitely dont mind that aspect of it, i just think the
finished product has stronger effect with my name on it
Mizan says: since he can capitalize on a personal vendetta with pretty
much every other wiz on here
Stardream asks: actually, i was thinking, perhaps, the note could be written
by the two of you, but let puppy put it up?

Mizan says: pain, fakir, verte, all of PA, and eurale
~*~Sin~*~: lmao
~*~Thomas~*~: i love my kid's name
~*~Hedren~*~: ?
Mizan says: he can play the puppy angle
~*~Thomas~*~: Mp40
~*~Sin~*~: hoth would probally spit out the ball of circuit after trying to swallow it
Stardream asks: he can?

Khrell says: Well it's hard to nail Eurale at times.  he seems to
randomly pop in for scant moments ;)

~*~Thomas~*~: lol
emote nods.  "Yep, you're right.  He's gotten into it with Puppy before as well, over other PA investigations."
Aingeal nods.  "Yep, you're right.  He's gotten into it with Puppy before as well, over other PA investigations." 
->> ~*~Hedren~*~: damn that would definetly not class as a hairball
Mizan says: yeah, since puppy has ruled on things in the past
Stardream says: ah, i see

Mizan says: i have been the wildcard (to players) thus far
'I agree, Mizan is the logical choice.
You say: I agree, Mizan is the logical choice.

logical choice

Mizan says: also i dont have any dirty laundry with females on here

~*~Hedren~*~: imagine if he had to shit it out
Stardream nods solemnly.
~*~Hedren~*~: hahaha
~*~Sin~*~: or does that come out of hoth's ass
Mizan tells you: its good knowing that... i quite seriously didnt expect to
hear it..

Stardream says: its sad when every senior wizard we have nearly, has a
problem with scathe

'So, subject to Puppy's input, Scathe is de-wizzed permanently.
You say: So, subject to Puppy's input, Scathe is de-wizzed

->> smile mizan
You smile at Mizan.
->> Mizan says: i might be feared and hated but i would like to think that
i at least try to be consistent
Mizan says: and that i havent been a femme stalker- so the random
people who were affected by this can read it and say:
'As for Noir, the general consensus is that he should be permanently destroyed as well, do I understand that correctly?
You ask: As for Noir, the general consensus is that he should be
permanently destroyed as well, do I understand that
correctly?

->> Mizan says: That mizan might be a mean fucker but i he hasnt harrassed
ME etc
~*~Wolfsbane~*~: eeewwwww
Stardream says: I dunno, part of me thinks yes

Stardream says: part of me thinks that may be too much

Mizan says: not destroyed but outed
Mizan says: his identity as that char revealed
'Ah, okay....I misunderstood what you meant, then.
You say: Ah, okay....I misunderstood what you meant, then.

->> Khrell says: Well to let him remain may generate problems in the future.

Stardream says: i know it will cause problems in the future, when he feels
he's safe to start talking to/harassing other people again

Khrell says: Char coudl be demoted in levels and removed from the guild

Mizan tells you: i just hope that B knows that i am not infallible

Mizan says: chars are easier to track than wizzes too
~*~Hedren~*~: damn i just got dizzy all of a sudden
Stardream says: nod

Khrell says: I know Eurale takes dim views of things like what
scathe/noir has done.

~*~Thomas~*~: nog

You say: Again, my initial reaction is to leave Noir intact, but at

->> Mizan says: that works
Stardream says: i think though, without his ability to see ip's and lurk
around invisible, he will be less of a nuisance than before

Mizan says: yes
emote nods, "I agree, Stardream."
Aingeal nods, "I agree, Stardream." 
->> Stardream says: works for me as well

'And.....honestly, it's giving him enough rope to hang himself.
Mizan says: the key for me is this... that if he is smacked down, he
might not be emboldened to take another step

Mizan says: and if he wants to bring this to another mud- lets just
say i dont know anyone as lenient and forgiving as boltar doing mud

given the chance

You say: It would be consistent with his past behaviors to lay low
for a few months after we do this...then start with a few
small things, feel his way.  We'll be waiting.

->> Stardream nods solemnly.
Stardream says: he will wait

Stardream says: its his MO to wait until the tension has eased

Mizan says: but he has not had to deal with an active information
campaign before
Mizan says: like i didnt even know he was demoted to L21 earlier
emote nods.  "I agree...this will take him by surprise."
Aingeal nods.  "I agree...this will take him by surprise." 
->> Stardream says: then begin again, talking to someone, lurking, slowly
harassing

Khrell says: Like Star said he will wait until he feels things have
cooled down before he starts being a pest again.

Mizan says: if there's a 'sex offender' stylized note in the green it
makes things different
'And...we'll be waiting.  We have the ability to watch everything he does, and I think this situation is extreme enough to warrant it.
You say: And...we'll be waiting.  We have the ability to watch
everything he does, and I think this situation is extreme

->> Stardream says: perhaps, you should place a bug on noirceur

Mizan grins evilly.
Stardream says: inform him of that fact

'Once he screws up again, he's gone, and that serves as a reinforcement to the warning we issued.
You say: Once he screws up again, he's gone, and that serves as a
reinforcement to the warning we issued.

->> Khrell asks: Like the inability to communicate?

smirk
You smirk.
->> Stardream says: and just tell him its going to be there for an indefinate
amount of time

Stardream says: it was a mistake for the bug that was on scathe to have been
removed

'Very reasonable.  If he does nothing wrong, it shouldn't matter to him.
You say: Very reasonable.  If he does nothing wrong, it shouldn't
matter to him.

->> Stardream nods solemnly.
Mizan says: it works for me :)
Mizan says: btw he does have a bug on him as of now
Khrell says: You know he may go off if he considers he's got nothing left
to loose.

Stardream says: oh, i thought it was taken off

Mizan says: i put it on earlier in the eve
Stardream says: ah, nod

'Well, honestly.....what can he do?  
You ask: Well, honestly.....what can he do?

Stardream says: true, you'll catch some heat too

~*~Wolfsbane~*~: hehehe this movie is so funny :P
Khrell says: He better not try nothign to you ladies..

Mizan says: but i am used to it
Mizan grins evilly.
Stardream chuckles politely.
'No....in fact, as you may recall, he told me that he would be surprised if you supported his demotion.
You say: No....in fact, as you may recall, he told me that he would
be surprised if you supported his demotion.

->> Khrell says: I stated before I take a dim view of going after a woman no
matter the situation.

Mizan says: and the reason i have not conflicted with him for years-
lets just say that was the outcome of WK on my part
~*~-*-~*~ Seymour announces: party on cloud 9....party on cloud 9
~*~-*-~*~ Seymour wonders on who to send the booze to.
Mizan says: he didn't dare push that frontier for years
Mizan says: and also boltar yelling at me for what i did to his player
char
Stardream says: i recall a falling out a few years back though between the
two of you

Stardream says: verte had to settle things at that time, if i remember
correctly

'It's very simple.  The consequence for harassing (as opposed to merely questioning) a PA wizard regarding a decision is imprisonment.  
You say: It's very simple.  The consequence for harassing (as opposed

->> Mizan says: this was pre-verte. I engaged in WK with him, locked his
char out of the game for 2 wks before B got involved
Stardream says: laf

Mizan says: he does not react to someone who uses force against him
very well
Mizan says: i think he will initially resist, then buckle
Stardream says: no, he doesn't

Stardream says: there isn't much he can do

Stardream says: right now he's doing the silent treatment thing

Stardream says: which means he's simmering

Mizan nods solemnly.
Stardream says: pretty soon he'll blow his gasket

emote nods.  "And, likely, planning."
Aingeal nods.  "And, likely, planning." 
->> Khrell says: and/or plotting

Stardream says: indeed, he'll be going to boltar as soon as possible

Mizan says: one other wiz who he tangled with- and F'ed him up was
Mythos
Mizan says: he is TERRIFIED of mythos
Stardream says: heh

Khrell says: That might explain why he stopped playing when mythos was
lev 700

Mizan nods solemnly.
Khrell says: THem mythos leave and Scathe pops back in the pic.

~*~Crack~*~: I'm prolly gonna die =)
Mizan nods solemnly.
~*~Thomas~*~: how big is he
Mizan says: and he always has been kissing my ass
Stardream says: he's quite lucky that Verte is generally a fair admin

to me

'Well, Boltar probably won't be back until tomorrow.
You say: Well, Boltar probably won't be back until tomorrow.

->> Mizan says: i am going to be at the beach starting tomorrow
Stardream says: there have been quite a few times in the past he probably
should have been demoted

  This is the innermost room of Aingeal's Cloud.  It is lined with mahogany
bookshelves containing esoteric texts from distant lands.  Against
one wall is an antique mahogany desk neatly stacked with ancient scrolls.
A large brick fireplace dominates the opposite wall, its broad, polished
stone mantle supporting a magnificent crystal longsword that glitters
brilliantly with the red and gold reflections of the merry fire as it dances
in the hearth.  Two overstuffed leather armchairs of deepest ebony
rest comfortably before the fireplace, separated by a small mahogany end
table.  A plush, wooly rug of light beige warms itself upon the floor before
the fireplace.  In the relative shadows to the east of the fireplace rests
a long couch, matching the leather chairs in every detail.  To the west
is the cool expanse of a picture window, complete with padded window
seat, that looks out upon the countryside below.  Tucked away in one
corner is hidden an azure portal, and the center of the room holds a 
mirror-like reflecting pool that is as smooth and still as glass.
    There are no obvious exits:
Mizan the professional bastard (neutral).
Blech: Stardream thinks she's fried her brain (toast).
Warmaster Khrell the Astartes Primarch (Fanatic).
