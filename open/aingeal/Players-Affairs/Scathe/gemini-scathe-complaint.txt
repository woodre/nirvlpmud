i am tired, and sick, and sick and tired
of noirceur / scathe running their mouth about my significant other.

if this keeps up, i will take action into my own hands.

please tell him to knock it off.

aingeal, i am clueless as to what his problem is...

yes she plays here, but thats not the point.

one say scathe was on as someone, and on a public channel he says:
someone beats the shit out of gemini's wife
then he quits the game

then last night, he starts running his mouth about stuff like that in tells as noirceur.

i'm not dealing with it.

my wife does play here, and dosent talk to him.

he just does this to piss me off. it doesnt work, but its annoying to the point the annoying is pissing me off.

and he does this clearly out of the blue.

i poke fun at people, but i never go after and publically emote that i beat the shit out of someones wife.... that is just uncalled for on a game.

thats all the info i have, and thats all that has happened. if this keeps occuring, i will just disallow her and myself to play here any longer i am that annoyed.

However, I have nothing to say about someone that infers motive from my speech
when he knows nothing about me or the relationships I have with people I'm
speaking about.  If he can't understand that, it's not only his grammar which
needs work.

  This is the innermost room of Aingeal's Cloud.  It is lined with mahogany
bookshelves containing esoteric texts from distant lands.  Against
one wall is an antique mahogany desk neatly stacked with ancient scrolls.
A large brick fireplace dominates the opposite wall, its broad, polished
stone mantle supporting a magnificent crystal longsword that glitters
brilliantly with the red and gold reflections of the merry fire as it dances
in the hearth.  Two overstuffed leather armchairs of deepest ebony
rest comfortably before the fireplace, separated by a small mahogany end
table.  A plush, wooly rug of light beige warms itself upon the floor before
the fireplace.  In the relative shadows to the east of the fireplace rests
a long couch, matching the leather chairs in every detail.  To the west
is the cool expanse of a picture window, complete with padded window
seat, that looks out upon the countryside below.  Tucked away in one
corner is hidden an azure portal, and the center of the room holds a 
mirror-like reflecting pool that is as smooth and still as glass.
    There are no obvious exits:
Ok.

halo scathe Okay...Gemini made a complaint that you are harassing him.  He specifically takes issue with you making comments about his wife.
You tell Scathe: Okay...Gemini made a complaint that you are harassing him.  He specifically takes issue with you making comments about his wife.
->> Sparkle gossips: Its a game people. If you lose your stuff cause you die,
you kill and get it back. You dont whine about it.
Happy gossips: I like whining about it.
(gossip) Happy smiles.
**>> Scathe tells You: Then I guess he shouldn't make comments about me when I don't speak to him.
Clair gossips: What intregues me is I got killed because I seemed naive and
polite...
Dazzler gossips: NOOOO
Sparkle gossips: You are a noob. You dont trust people. That is how you
keep your things.
Sparkle gossips: But you dont whine about it and expect 'justice'.
Dazzler gossips: u got killed because u are saying u are polite but u arn't
Clair gossips: Well then I shall stick to this advice and trust now even a
person of high power then?
Clair gossips: Not
Dazzler gossips: i did nothing to you
Sparkle gossips: Trust who you choose. I'm just telling you like it is.
Boltar wizs: hmm... might want to go easier on ther real newbies...
**>> Scathe tells You: Oh, and btw...he made HIS comments on the star channel for all to see.  I sent him 2 tells, one telling him if he has so much time and energy to go take care of his wife, and the other in response to a tell of his to go work on his spelling.
Clair gossips: I am not accusing you, Dazzler.
Crip gossips: yea
Sparkle wizs: That isnt a real newbie Boltar.
Crip gossips: believe sparkle
Boltar wizs: who is it then?
Sparkle wizs: Just pretending to be.
Crip gossips: <----- psychotic bastard
Sparkle wizs: One of the kids from Maryland.
halo scathe He specifically said that you made a comment on gossip "Someone beats the shit out of Gemini's wife" then logged out, and that you started sending tells to him along the same line.

for the guidence, Sparkle.

halo scathe I was not here, and saw none of it.  What comments did he make to you on the star channel?
You tell Scathe: I was not here, and saw none of it.  What comments did he make to you on the star channel?
->> Sparkle wizs: Its a he and he died and someone took his things. So he
spammed me wanting justice.
**>> Scathe tells You: I don't recally ANY message of the sort appearing on there, and it would've been hard for me to do since I only had Noirceur on, who cannot speak on any channel as "Someone"
**>> Scathe tells You: Sounds like you were sold a few lies
halo scathe I was not sold anything.  I am telling you what Gemini has alleged, and I'm asking for your side of the story.
You tell Scathe: I was not sold anything.  I am telling you what Gemini has alleged, and I'm asking for your side of the story.
->> **>> Scathe tells You: You can ask Sparkle to verify what was said on public channels and the tells since I sent both to her.  I wasn't on as Scathe, so his allegation that I said anything about his wife is a fabrication of the highest degree
Happy ( player 19+12 ) has left the game.
**>> Scathe tells You: As for what he said about me on star, I don't care to repeat it unless you need the comment verbatum.

Sparkle wizs: Aingeal, when you have a moment, I would like to speak with
you and Mizan.

**>> Scathe tells You: He was trying to drum up trouble for me, including sending tells to the people I was talking to who told him it was all in good fun.  If he can't accept the fact that when he makes rude and negative comments about people, they might respond in kind, he needs to go back to grade school
halo scathe Do you recall any other comments that were made by Gemini?
You tell Scathe: Do you recall any other comments that were made by Gemini?

haloe sparkle nods.  "Do you recall anything else that happened?"
You faremote to Sparkle: nods.  "Do you recall anything else that happened?"
->> Halo ( player 12 ) has entered the game.
Sparkle tells you, "Just that Gem was making some pretty rude comments to Noir. Something about him being so mean now and all. And Noir wasnt doing anything at the time.. what he does in tells is his business. But I saw them too. Gem just seemed to be upset that night and it got lashed out on Noir."
Lesa ( player 8 ) has entered the game.
haloe scathe nods.  "Alright.  Thank you for letting me know what happened.  In my opinion, this is not harassment by either of you, although it sounds like you were both being a bit juvenile by the time you had made each other angry."
You faremote to Scathe: nods.  "Alright.  Thank you for letting me know what happened.  In my opinion, this is not harassment by either of you, although it sounds like you were both being a bit juvenile by the time you had made each other angry."

You tell Sparkle: One second, then on my way....

**>> Scathe tells You: I don't give a shit what any of you think
halo scathe I'm going to mail Gemini with my decision, explaining that I do not believe this was harassment.  
You tell Scathe: I'm going to mail Gemini with my decision, explaining that I do not believe this was harassment.
->> haloe scathe sighs.  "Yes, you've made that perfectly plain many times.  Just a piece of advice that you can take or leave:  You know that Gemini can push your buttons.  If you let him get a reaction out of you, then your behavior may become destructive and juvenile."

I reviewed your two mudmails, and I have spoken with both Scathe and a witness who was aware

Vital wizs: hungry...bah
Mizan wizs: it's commented out in the /room/init_file file
(wiz) Vital is typing like Maddog again
of your exchange with Scathe / Noirceur (as you indicated that both were on).  Although it is clear
]Mizan wizs: until it'
the two of you were not very nice to each other, I did not see any behavior that rose to the level
]Mizan wizs: s in production mode, it stays commented out i think
Mizan wizs: so you can load and unload it manually, and keep people from
wandering in :)
Lexi wizs: it was there yesterday
of harassment.  Juvenile flapping, yes
harassment, no.  Thus, I am taking no official action against
]]Scathe / Noirceur.  However, I have suggested to him, as I now suggest to you, that

Mizan wizs: mmm, from what i know it usually stays unloaded

Mizan wizs: it might have been in the game because it was loaded
Mizan wizs: but not automatically :)

Gargoyle ( player 18 ) has entered the game.
Lexi wizs: hmmm it won't load either and i haven't touched it
Mizan wizs: 'load /players/lexi/castle' doesn't bring it up?
