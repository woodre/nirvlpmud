I demoted Scathe to L21 again for desting Hogath repeatedly.

Khrell and Hogath were in Stardream's workroom talking and
Noirceur (Scathe) told Stardream they were having mudsex,
so Stardream told Khrell and Hogath, and Hogath moaned at
Noirceur as a joke, and Noirceur logged on Scathe and
dested Hogath repeatedly.

I'm sick of these bullshit games and I think you are too,
so I demoted him to L21 for now.  As far as a dewizing
is concerned, it's up to Puppy and Aingeal to decide but
we all know about good ol' Scathe and his harrassment/
bullshit for the past 7 years or so.

[Of course, you can reverse any of this you want, but
I'm only doing this for the good of the mud ;)]

Mizan knows some more about this mess, as well.

Subj: scathe booting me ;) on saturday night

Cc: (To: puppy) aingeal, vertebraker
Date: Aug  1 18:05

It has been brought to my attention that i should mail you all concerning an incident that occured on sat
July 31/Sun Aug 1.  Three wizes, Stardream, Khrell, and myself were all talking in Stardream's workroom when
Noirceur made some lewd references to Stardream about what was going on in the room.  So i being my impulsive
and whitty self decided to flirt with him a bit.  I licked him once and got booted/dested by i assume his wiz.
Upon returning to the mud I, and i know i shoulda stopped but it was so funny, moaned at him.  Bam! I was booted
again.  He then proceeded to go off on Stardream about it, and you would have to ask her what was said in the
inccident.  As for my part if he was really upset about it and would have said to leave him alone i would have
done so gladly.  I'm not upset about it, nor do i really seek anything against him.  I would just like for it to
be clarified as to what proper behavior in player wiz sep is for him.

Hope this helps and doesn't hinder

I think your action was wholly appropriate.
Just as an FYI, I received a complaint from Noirceur (via mudmail) today
complaining that he received one time: "Khrell spanks you from afar!"
He apparently believes this to be harassing behavior, as he and Khrell had some issues
in the past and were asked to stay away from each other.  Noir did not even
mention that Scathe had been demoted, nor did I receive a mailing from
Scathe about the demotion.  
At any rate, I'll be happy to deal with the problem if Scathe complains about
the demotion (as well as the complaint about Khrell's emote), and I'll
post a full write-up in the next few days documenting this incident.  
Puppy, feel free to chime in if you disagree, or have anything to add.  *grin*
Thank you!

  This is the innermost room of Aingeal's Cloud.  It is lined with mahogany
bookshelves containing esoteric texts from distant lands.  Against
one wall is an antique mahogany desk neatly stacked with ancient scrolls.
A large brick fireplace dominates the opposite wall, its broad, polished
stone mantle supporting a magnificent crystal longsword that glitters
brilliantly with the red and gold reflections of the merry fire as it dances
in the hearth.  Two overstuffed leather armchairs of deepest ebony
rest comfortably before the fireplace, separated by a small mahogany end
table.  A plush, wooly rug of light beige warms itself upon the floor before
the fireplace.  In the relative shadows to the east of the fireplace rests
a long couch, matching the leather chairs in every detail.  To the west
is the cool expanse of a picture window, complete with padded window
seat, that looks out upon the countryside below.  Tucked away in one
corner is hidden an azure portal, and the center of the room holds a 
mirror-like reflecting pool that is as smooth and still as glass.

Everyone,
I've had a chance to talk to Hogath, Mizan, and Khrell, but am still
awaiting a chance to talk to Stardream.  Although I want to speak 
with her, and with Scathe, as well as consult with Puppy about this,
I am leaning toward recommending de-wizzing Scathe.  This incident
alone certainly doesn't warrant such action, but after reviewing the
problems he has caused or has been directly involved in, and considering
the lack of other contributions he makes as a wizard (i.e. he no longer
codes, he does not involve himself in player disputes in a positive 
manner that would help resolve them, he does not assist newer wizards
in any way, etc.), I believe that it would be in the best interest of the
mud to de-wiz him.  Again, I wish to speak to a few more people
before making my final recommendation, and I'm sure that Puppy 
will want to speak to this issue as well.

                     Dest

Syntax:    dest <obj>

Desc:
           This is a counterpoint of clone. You use this command to 
           remove an object from your immediate surroundings or 
           inventory. Be considerate and do not dest things in public
           areas like green that are not yours or that are still in 
           use by others.

Warning:   If you dest a monster it drops all its current inventory
           as it departs so if removing a bugged monster remember 
           not to leave things for players to find. Don't dest mobs
           for players and don't dest players without good reason.

Example:   dest bag
                  results
           bag is destructed in inventory or if not present there 
           then in the room

no, in my opinion it wasn't teasing.  teasing is done
between friends or people who know one another.  i'd
consider this a crude taunt of some sort, for what reason i
don't know of care.

halo noirceur Yes, you both should.  However, could sending her a tell referring to Khrell when he is with her and talking to her be considered 'contact'?  What is your opinion?

why would this be?

->> halo stardream Hey, there.  I heard there was a problem yesterday with Scathe.  What happened?
You tell Stardream: Hey, there.  I heard there was a problem yesterday with Scathe.  What happened?
->> Breeti ( player 19+100 ) has entered the game.
Stardream tells you: well, essentially, there were two wizards sitting in my
workroom conversing with me, hogath and khrell

Korwrath ( player 16 ) has entered the game.
Mizan nods solemnly at you from afar.
->> Stardream tells you: noirceur sent me a tell saying we were having mudsex, i
shared that with the two of them

Stardream tells you: they both jokingly sent him an emote moaning at him

Breeti ( player 19+100 ) has left the game.
Stardream tells you: he subsequently logged on scathe and somehow booted hogath
twice in a row

Stardream tells you: i confronted him on it, he admitted it was him that did it,
i asked him why he didn't simply tell them not to bother
him, he said someone had to teach them a lesson

Stardream tells you: i told him he went about it wrong, and he mentioned how
khrell was not supposed to be bothering him in any way

Stardream tells you: only he never did anything to khrell, only to hogath, so I
don't see how he thought it was an excuse

Bishop ( player 19+19 ) has entered the game.
Stardream tells you: and thats basically what it amounted to, was not a huge
ordeal, but was uncalled for, and out of line if you ask me

halo stardream Did he say or do anything to you that upset you?
You tell Stardream: Did he say or do anything to you that upset you?
->> Hedren ( player 16 ) has entered the game.
Stardream tells you: well, his attitude when I asked him why he did it to hogath
was rude and he essentially told me to mind my own business,
but other than that... no

haloe stardream nods.  "Okay, fair enough.  Who did you originally report this to?"
You faremote to Stardream: nods.  "Okay, fair enough.  Who did you originally report this to?"
->> Stardream tells you: I asked mizan originally if a wizard was allowed to do it,
he said no, it was highly frowned about, asked me what
situation i was refering to, and told me to have Hogath
report it to you and puppy

Stardream tells you: then i mentioned to him that I had considered telling Verte,
but thought I would be a 'tattle tail'

Stardream tells you: he said I ought to anyways, so that a senior wiz was aware
of it

haloe stardream nods.  "Okay....is that when Verte logged on and demoted Scathe?"
You faremote to Stardream: nods.  "Okay....is that when Verte logged on and demoted Scathe?"
->> Stardream tells you: nod, he spoke to mizan about what happened, and myself, then
decided to demote him

Poggio ( player 19+31 ) has left the game.
halo stardream nods again.  "Do you have a history with Scathe?  I know Verte's reasons for what he did, and I believe the action was appropriate, but I'm interested to know whether you have had problems with Scathe in the past."
You tell Stardream: nods again.  "Do you have a history with Scathe?  I know Verte's reasons for what he did, and I believe the action was appropriate, but I'm interested to know whether you have had problems with Scathe in the past."
->> Stardream tells you: we have a 'complicated' relationship, I would consider him
to be a friend in some sense of the word, but he has had
ocassions where he has been very nasty towards me, spoken
inappropriately, and I believe he has on ocassion, in the
past, although I can't prove it, snooped my conversations

Stardream tells you: I consider him to be a very childish and spiteful person at
times

haloe stardream nods.  "I actually understand all of that very well, believe it or not."
You faremote to Stardream: nods.  "I actually understand all of that very well, believe it or not."
->> Stardream tells you: I'm sure you do, heh

chuckle stardream
You chuckle at Stardream from afar.
->> Cloud ( player 10 ) has left the game.
halo stardream I try not to let my history with him cloud my judgment in these matters, which is why I'm talking to everyone involved, as well as consulting with Puppy, before Puppy and I make any final recommendations.
You tell Stardream: I try not to let my history with him cloud my judgment in these matters, which is why I'm talking to everyone involved, as well as consulting with Puppy, before Puppy and I make any final recommendations.
->> Seymour hugs you from afar.
->> Stardream tells you: understood, I, even considering him a friend in some sense
of the word, see no purpose in him being a wizard anymore
really, he seems to only want to be a wizard to find out
people's alts for his own personal reasons, snoop on people,
and be a general nuisance to the populace.

halo stardream I'm going to be very frank.  When I searched my PA write-ups, I found Noirceur or Scathe involved in four of them within the past year.  There have been other incidents which were minor enough I didn't do a write-up on them, but I recall his involvement.

->> halo stardream I agree with you that he is not being productive, and appears to be disruptive.  He appears to use his wiz abilities inappropriately.
You tell Stardream: I agree with you that he is not being productive, and appears to be disruptive.  He appears to use his wiz abilities inappropriately.
->> Pike ( player 19+100 ) has entered the game.
Seymour tells you: ugh...I got a headache...

Stardream tells you: ever since I've wized, it seems he's felt like he could
share all his gossip with me more freely, which has made me
more convinced that he's only using his wiz powers for his
own personal interests

Stardream tells you: since he doesn't have to worry about getting in trouble for
sharing alts, he discusses them quite freely

haloe stardream nods.  "Do you have any specific recollection of him doing this, or is it more a general feeling based on the long-term contact?"
You faremote to Stardream: nods.  "Do you have any specific recollection of him doing this, or is it more a general feeling based on the long-term contact?"
->> halo stardream Use of his wiz powers for his own personal interests, I mean.
You tell Stardream: Use of his wiz powers for his own personal interests, I mean.
->> Thomas ( player 19+11 ) has left the game.
halo stardream I also know that something happened some months ago between him and you that Boltar has directed him not to talk about and that was not handled by the PA wizards.  Are you under the same directive?
You tell Stardream: I also know that something happened some months ago between him and you that Boltar has directed him not to talk about and that was not handled by the PA wizards.  Are you under the same directive?
->> halo stardream I bring this up because he seemed to think it was some sort of mitigating circumstance to offset his behavior this time, but he would not tell me what happened or how it acted in mitigation.
You tell Stardream: I bring this up because he seemed to think it was some sort of mitigating circumstance to offset his behavior this time, but he would not tell me what happened or how it acted in mitigation.
->> Stardream tells you: mostly its a general feeling, although I do know he logs in
quite a bit as scathe just to check people's ip's if he
doesn't recognize the name, i've seen him do it, and he's
then talked about that person as soon as he's discovered who
it was

Stardream tells you: heh we have such a rocky history, i'm not entirely sure
which incident you're refering to

haloe stardream nods.  "It is as if he skirts the edge of propriety, but stays in a gray area much of the time."
You faremote to Stardream: nods.  "It is as if he skirts the edge of propriety, but stays in a gray area much of the time."
->> (Invis) fred wizs: evening all
haloe stardream chuckles, shaking her head.  "I'm sorry....it's not funny, but I SO understand what you mean."
(Invis) hogath wizs: lo
You faremote to Stardream: chuckles, shaking her head.  "I'm sorry....it's not funny, but I SO understand what you mean."
->> Stardream tells you: indeed, he knows the lines, he knows where he can push the
limits and where he can't

wiz Hey, Fred!
Aingeal wizs: Hey, Fred!
->> (Invis) khrell wizs: holas Freddie
Fred licks you from afar.
->> Mizan wizs: bork
Noirceur ( player 19+49 ) has left the game.
cuddle fred
You cuddle Fred from afar.
->> Stardream tells you: and of course, he makes sure to say anything truly
incriminating on AIM instead of here

haloe stardream laughs.  "Yes, he does.  I do not IM with him anymore....not in a long, long time."
You faremote to Stardream: laughs.  "Yes, he does.  I do not IM with him anymore....not in a long, long time."
->> (Invis) fred wizs: geez I thought you said bjork don't scare me like that.
Stardream tells you: nod, heh, if I block him then he pouts and whatnot

Thomas ( player 19+11 ) has entered the game.
halo stardream So, you don't know which incident, if any, was serious enough to warrant a directive from Boltar to not discuss it with anyone?  Or, if you're not permitted to discuss it, just tell me, I won't press.
You tell Stardream: So, you don't know which incident, if any, was serious enough to warrant a directive from Boltar to not discuss it with anyone?  Or, if you're not permitted to discuss it, just tell me, I won't press.
->> (wiz) (invis) khrell sneak up behidn Fred and goes 'BJORK!'
Stardream tells you: hrmmm, specifically no, if you have any type of reference
you could give me regarding it, the approximate time it
happened, anything like that?

(wiz) Khrell jabs Fred in both eyes!
Khrell sticks his hand up goofily in between his eyes.
What the hell?
Sweetpea ( player 19+19 ) has entered the game.
(//Fred//): how goes it?
Stardream tells you: i mean, a couple years ago, i can remember a time when he
went absolutely balistic on me, called me every name in the
book, and did numerous mean things and continued his little
jabs for quite some time

haloe stardream shakes her head thoughtfully.  "No.....I don't have any idea when it was, to be honest.  By the way, what happened when he 'went balistic' on you a few years ago?  Were there any consequences?"
You faremote to Stardream: shakes her head thoughtfully.  "No.....I don't have any idea when it was, to be honest.  By the way, what happened when he 'went balistic' on you a few years ago?  Were there any consequences?"
->> haloe fred cuddles you close, then smiles warmly.  "It goes well!  How are you, dear?"
You faremote to Fred: cuddles you close, then smiles warmly.  "It goes well!  How are you, dear?"
->> Stardream tells you: well, specifically for that, no, it was a whole batch of
things that caused him to be demoted at that time, that was
just a tiny factor as far as I was told, may not have ever
figured into it

Stardream tells you: think it'd be unwise for me to ask him what type of thing it
was that Boltar told him not to talk about?

Stardream tells you: i'd just like to have some clue, I wasn't aware boltar ever
told him not to talk to me about it

Stardream tells you: it is possible it was someone else however, he's been told
to not talk to or about so many people at so many different
times

haloe stardream arches one eyebrow thoughtfully.  "Well....I don't know that it would be unwise, although he may not tell you.  He is aware that he may face more serious consequences than the demotion, and he's being very cautious."
You faremote to Stardream: arches one eyebrow thoughtfully.  "Well....I don't know that it would be unwise, although he may not tell you.  He is aware that he may face more serious consequences than the demotion, and he's being very cautious."
->> (//Fred//): it's going fine for me =)
Stardream tells you: nod, true

halo stardream I don't have any objection, though, if you're willing to ask him, and it would help me to know what happened.
You tell Stardream: I don't have any objection, though, if you're willing to ask him, and it would help me to know what happened.
->> grin fred
You grin evilly at Fred from afar.
->> halo fred Are you enjoying this lovely summer we're having?
You tell Fred: Are you enjoying this lovely summer we're having?
->> Stardream tells you: odds are, he won't speak to me at all

Stardream tells you: after i told him how wrong he was last night for his
behavior, i got the silent treatment

halo stardream It's hard to tell.  At any rate, if he is willing to talk about it, please let me know, okay?
You tell Stardream: It's hard to tell.  At any rate, if he is willing to talk about it, please let me know, okay?
->> Stardream nods solemnly at you from afar.
->> (//Fred//): trying to when I'm not at work, or sitting on here, or working around the house. =)
halo stardream Do you recall what prompted him to go off on you a few years ago?
You tell Stardream: Do you recall what prompted him to go off on you a few years ago?
->> Guest ( player 1 ) has entered the game.
Levus ( player 19+3 ) has entered the game.
Levus bows with vampiric grace to you from far off in the distance.
Stardream tells you: he considered me to have 'led him on' when I told him I was
not interested in him, but instead in someone else I had
been speaking to here, he started calling me a whore, bitch,
slut, added in every choice word and combination you could
possibly come up with

Sweetpea ( player 19+19 ) has left the game.
smile levus
You smile at Levus from afar.
->> haloe stardream frowns.  "I'm sorry you had to go through that.  I know what that's like, and it's really unpleasant."
You faremote to Stardream: frowns.  "I'm sorry you had to go through that.  I know what that's like, and it's really unpleasant."

**Short deletion of very sensitive RL information at the request of Stardream**

Stardream tells you: btw, I asked him about the boltar thing, he's not speaking
to me apparently, he's been ignoring me

Crack ( player 19+14 ) has entered the game.
haloe stardream sighs.  "True......there's nothing I can do about IM.  Have you considered just severing your ties to him altogether?"
You faremote to Stardream: sighs.  "True......there's nothing I can do about IM.  Have you considered just severing your ties to him altogether?"
->> haloe stardream smiles ruefully.  "Figures....."
You faremote to Stardream: smiles ruefully.  "Figures....."
->> Stardream tells you: nod, and have on several ocassions, only to have him
basically convince me to forgive him, or that i was being
ridiculous

Stardream tells you: I just happen to be too forgiving I guess

Stardream tells you: usually i just let things go after a while

haloe stardream nods.  "That's certainly his MO.  Once he does something, he attempts to twist everything to make it appear that he is blameless or misunderstood, or that you are overreacting."
You faremote to Stardream: nods.  "That's certainly his MO.  Once he does something, he attempts to twist everything to make it appear that he is blameless or misunderstood, or that you are overreacting."
->> Stardream tells you: this time I doubt it will be a problem, I don't think he'll
be speaking to me again

Jae ( player 5 ) has left the game.
Stardream tells you: although of course he is the one who acted out, i'll be the
one blamed for it in some way, by his standards

halo stardream So, is there anything else about this latest incident, or about Scathe's behavior or discipline problems, that you want to tell me, or that you think would be helpful in this decision?
You tell Stardream: So, is there anything else about this latest incident, or about Scathe's behavior or discipline problems, that you want to tell me, or that you think would be helpful in this decision?
->> Stardream tells you: I've known him since i started here

Stardream tells you: and I've seen him 'harass' I don't know how many women at
different times during the span of the last 8 years or so

Stardream tells you: including myself

Stardream tells you: I don't know how many women have complained to me, about
him, and I can't tell you how many he's complained to me
about

~*~Mizan~*~: hmm
~*~Thomas~*~: hi mizan
Stardream tells you: but his behavior and 'MO' have never changed at all during
that time... he is nice until they show the slightest bit of
interest in someone else, then he does his balistic routine,
where he harasses them, trashes them to everyone else, and
makes everyone he's around think less of that person

Stardream tells you: I can't see that changing at any point in the future

~*~Mizan~*~: Reading the last thing on channel star made me think of the old Canadian adage.
Juniper ( player 19 ) has left the game.
~*~Mizan~*~: "Don't whizz on the electric fence"
Stardream tells you: if you asked all the women he's talked to on this game, I
think they would tell you the exact same thing

~*~-*-~*~ Wolfsbane giggles at Mizan.
~*~Korwrath~*~: that your secret, eh?
~*~Wolfsbane~*~: gotta love those Canadians :P
haloe stardream nods.  "I completely agree with your assessment."
You faremote to Stardream: nods.  "I completely agree with your assessment."
->> ~*~Mizan~*~: well, someone was talking about peeing on a cyber to short out their circuits...
Stardream tells you: and even from a guy's perspective, I can't tell you how many
guys have complained about him, his behavior, his rudeness,
the entire guild hates him because he hasn't even the
slightest bit of respect for any other players

~*~Mizan~*~: and i pondered the intense penile electrocution that would ensue
~*~Korwrath~*~: you know golden showers may turn some cybers on and act like a contuctive liquid.
~*~Wolfsbane~*~: yeah it kind of goes along the lines as dont eat yellow snow...one of those common sense deals :P
Stardream tells you: and I'm honestly not angry at him for anything, this is just
my honest assesment of him as a player/wiz here

~*~Sin~*~: lol
~*~Mizan~*~: mmm
~*~Mizan~*~: yellow snow
~*~Wolfsbane~*~: heheh there is actually a road here in town clled Yellowsnow Trail :P
~*~Mizan~*~: WOOT

You tell Stardream: I need to talk with Puppy, who may temper the seriousness of my intended recommendations.....
->> Stardream tells you: nod, perhaps he's more objective

halo stardream Thank you for your insight, though.  Please let me know if you have any other thoughts.  Puppy may speak with you as well.
