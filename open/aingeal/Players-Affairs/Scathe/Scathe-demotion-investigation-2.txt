 Stardream tells you: of course, again, he was also smart enough to use IM instead
of game to say it

Stardream tells you: not much anyone can do about what someone says off of here

Stardream tells you: btw, I asked him about the boltar thing, he's not speaking
to me apparently, he's been ignoring me

Crack ( player 19+14 ) has entered the game.
haloe stardream sighs.  "True......there's nothing I can do about IM.  Have you considered just
severing your ties to him altogether?"
You faremote to Stardream: sighs.  "True......there's nothing I can do about IM.  Have you

->> haloe stardream smiles ruefully.  "Figures....."
You faremote to Stardream: smiles ruefully.  "Figures....."
->> Stardream tells you: nod, and have on several ocassions, only to have him
basically convince me to forgive him, or that i was being
ridiculous

Stardream tells you: I just happen to be too forgiving I guess

Stardream tells you: usually i just let things go after a while

haloe stardream nods.  "That's certainly his MO.  Once he does something, he attempts to twist
everything to make it appear that he is blameless or misunderstood, or that you are overreacting."

->> Stardream tells you: this time I doubt it will be a problem, I don't think he'll
be speaking to me again

Jae ( player 5 ) has left the game.
Stardream tells you: although of course he is the one who acted out, i'll be the
one blamed for it in some way, by his standards

halo stardream So, is there anything else about this latest incident, or about Scathe's behavior or
discipline problems, that you want to tell me, or that you think would be helpful in this decision?
You tell Stardream: So, is there anything else about this latest incident, or about Scathe's

->> Stardream tells you: I've known him since i started here

Stardream tells you: and I've seen him 'harass' I don't know how many women at
different times during the span of the last 8 years or so

Stardream tells you: including myself

Stardream tells you: I don't know how many women have complained to me, about
him, and I can't tell you how many he's complained to me
about

~*~Mizan~*~: hmm
~*~Thomas~*~: hi mizan
Stardream tells you: but his behavior and 'MO' have never changed at all during
that time... he is nice until they show the slightest bit of
interest in someone else, then he does his balistic routine,
where he harasses them, trashes them to everyone else, and
makes everyone he's around think less of that person

Stardream tells you: I can't see that changing at any point in the future

~*~Mizan~*~: Reading the last thing on channel star made me think of the old Canadian adage.
Juniper ( player 19 ) has left the game.
~*~Mizan~*~: "Don't whizz on the electric fence"
Stardream tells you: if you asked all the women he's talked to on this game, I
think they would tell you the exact same thing

~*~-*-~*~ Wolfsbane giggles at Mizan.
~*~Korwrath~*~: that your secret, eh?
~*~Wolfsbane~*~: gotta love those Canadians :P
haloe stardream nods.  "I completely agree with your assessment."
You faremote to Stardream: nods.  "I completely agree with your assessment."
->> ~*~Mizan~*~: well, someone was talking about peeing on a cyber to short out their
circuits...
Stardream tells you: and even from a guy's perspective, I can't tell you how many
guys have complained about him, his behavior, his rudeness,
the entire guild hates him because he hasn't even the
slightest bit of respect for any other players

~*~Mizan~*~: and i pondered the intense penile electrocution that would ensue
~*~Korwrath~*~: you know golden showers may turn some cybers on and act like a contuctive
liquid.
~*~Wolfsbane~*~: yeah it kind of goes along the lines as dont eat yellow snow...one of those
common sense deals :P
Stardream tells you: and I'm honestly not angry at him for anything, this is just
my honest assesment of him as a player/wiz here

~*~Sin~*~: lol
~*~Mizan~*~: mmm
~*~Mizan~*~: yellow snow
~*~Wolfsbane~*~: heheh there is actually a road here in town clled Yellowsnow Trail :P
~*~Mizan~*~: WOOT

halo stardream  Just between you and me.....subject to Puppy's input, it is my intent to
recommend that he be de-wizzed with a warning that if we receive another substantiated
complaint about him in the next year, no matter how minor, he be imprisoned for a substantial
period of time.

Bambua ( player 18 ) has entered the game.
Stardream tells you: I would have to say, I agree with that recommendation, I
just can't see him changing his ways, and he's caused a lot
of people grief here

halo stardream And, to be perfectly honest, I have concerns about him being dangerous.  I, too,
would consider him a 'friend' of sorts, and I received the same treatment you did....for a long
period of time, actually.

->> Stardream tells you: heh, i just said to him on IM 'i can see you're not idle, so
you must be ignoring me' ... he logged off immediately after

halo stardream I'm honestly not angry about it, but objectively, his possessive 'over-the-top'
behavior is way too close to stalking-type behavior.   That's what concerns me.

->> Stardream tells you: not that i'm recommending this, but if you took a poll, i'm
nearly possitive that everyone would feel he's a general
nuisance to the game

halo stardream chuckles.  "I suspect you're right on that."
You tell Stardream: chuckles.  "I suspect you're right on that."
->> Stardream tells you: indeed, it has concerned me in the past as well, i worried
about that particularly after he went balistic on me

halo stardream He seems to follow the classic cycle of an abuser, including the escalation of the
abuse from cycle to cycle, until he focuses on someone else after the clean break.

->> Stardream tells you: nod, I agree, he's not mentally stable, I think he prays on
women and when the realize that he's the wrong kind of guy
for them, thats when he goes crazy on them

Stardream tells you: he slowly gets more and more possessive, and sees nothing
wrong with it

halo stardream I'm afraid that if he became too attached to someone here (recall, I was -always-
unavailable irl, and made that clear from the start -- it sounds as if you did as well, so I suspect
that gave us some measure of protection)....

You tell Stardream: ....that he could easily cross the barrier between possessive in-game (or

->> Stardream tells you: nod, I think its possible if he had the funding to do so,
he'd be much more inclined to cross the barrier, i think
that may be one of the major things holding him back

Stardream tells you: you may want to speak with his most recent girl/victim...
dasani.... although it doesn't hold relevance to this
particular case, I think she might offer some more recent
insight into his behavior

halo stardream I suspect you're right about that.....and that slim a protection does not give me
much comfort.

the original situation started, b/c i shared that with the
two wizards in my workroom, so they decided to mock him
about it in innnocent ways, by sending him emotes

halo mizan Agreed.  So, as to my recommendations:  Subject to Puppy's thoughts, I'm going to
recommend that he be de-wizzed, and warned that if we receive even ONE substantiated
complaint about him in the next year, it's prison for an extended period....

->> Mizan tells you: i think he should be dewizzed- period

halo mizan i.e. 6 months to a year.  Second substaintiated complaint, no matter how minor, he's
sitebanned.
Mizan tells you: too many chances

he's sitebanned.
->> Stardream tells you: thats another thing i'm talking about, how when you're on
with 'unknown newbies' he still contacts you, like you want
him to know or bother you if you're on as a new char... if
you did, you'd contact him

halo mizan You think so?  You may be right, I'm soft.  But de-wizzing is a certainty right now.
You tell Mizan: You think so?  You may be right, I'm soft.  But de-wizzing is a certainty right

->> Mizan tells you: he has had about 5 or 6 chances since i came back even...

Mizan tells you: i think it should be just done with

Stardream tells you: sorry, it appears you've cracked a hole in the dam... now
i'm just rambling about things he does

halo mizan You mean sitebanning right now?
You tell Mizan: You mean sitebanning right now?

Khrell huggles you warmly, making you cuddle up with him.

You tell Stardream: It's okay....believe me, I'm more than happy to listen.
->> Mizan tells you: as a wiz he should be effectively gone. As a player, the
main offender (noirceur) should be outed

Mizan tells you: i mean, just my opinion of course but he needs to be sent a
hard message

Mizan tells you: and then this note for the green, i would not mind even
preparing a draft that can be tweaked

Stardream tells you: mind if i drop in on your room and your convo w/ khrell?
