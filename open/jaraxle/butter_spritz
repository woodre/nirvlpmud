Ingredients     
      2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1 cup butter, softened 
1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar 
2 egg yolks 
1/2 teaspoon almond extract 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 

 Directions     
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Sift together the flour and salt; set aside.  
2 In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Stir in the egg yolks, almond extract and vanilla extract. Gradually blend in the sifted ingredients. Fill a cookie press with dough and shoot cookies about 1 1/2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet. If you like, decorate with sugar or sprinkles at this time.  
3 Bake for 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven.
