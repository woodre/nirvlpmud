Ingredients     
      1 cup pecan halves or pieces 
1 cup honey 
3/4 cup butter 
1/4 cup vegetable oil 
4 (6 ounce) filets salmon 
 salt to taste 
 freshly ground black pepper to taste 
 

 Directions    
 
1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pecans in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake until brown and crisp, about 5 minutes, stirring 2 or 3 times to toast uniformly. Cool to room temperature, and chop coarsely. 
2 In a small saucepan over medium high heat, combine honey with half of the butter. Stir in the toasted pecans. Cook until pecans are coated in a glossy glaze, about 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm. 
3 In a large saute pan over high heat, melt remaining butter with oil. Season fish with salt and pepper to taste. Saute until filets are firm to the touch, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to serving plate and spoon glaze over top.
