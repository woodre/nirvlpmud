 'spaghetti alla carbonara'
 4 people serving
 6 spoons of parmigiano cheese (please, parmigiano and not parmesan)  *grin*
 some salt and some pepper
 at your willings
 mix for 2 minutes the previous ingredients all together in a bowl
 let it be
 cut 3 oz of a single slice of bacon into small cubes
 the slice must be thick, about 1/2th of an inch
 cut the slice into small cubes
 put two spoons of olive oil into a small pan, let it run hot and dive the bacon into it. let it get to crispy but not to carbon  *giggle*
 the bacon still needs to be brown, not black
 buy thick spaghetti, not the very thin ones
 do you know bucatini?
 also other kind of thick spachetti are ok
 cook the spaghetti at your willing BUT, they must be still hard
 do you know the meaning of 'al dente'?
 between al dente and hard
 to test it, get one noodle, break it, in its inside there must still be a very very small hard part
 take the spaghetti off the water
 and dry them
 pour the spaghetti into a large pan where there are the eggs, the parmigiano, the pepper, the bacn and all
 put on the fire again, for one minute or two, shaking continuosly
 the serving is ready when the egg are cooked
 the eggs were almost liquid, but when you shake them with the hot spaghetti and on the fire, they will cook
 last touch: you can put more pepper on the single servings and more parmigiano, at your willings
 and eventually some more bacon as well, still cut into small cubes and crispy
