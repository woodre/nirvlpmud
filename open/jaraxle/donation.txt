[:] Proposal for items awarded for donations to Nirvana [:]

	I would like to make a proposal towards other
   players to reward them for making donations to the
   game.  I am thinking by making unique, loading
   items that are not overbearingly powerful, yet that
   are useful to the players.
	I think by making the rewards monetarilly based
   we could influence donations and increase the 
   specialty of the reward.
	This would possibly bring in some donations 
   from sources who would not thing to donate to the
   game.  This would help keep the mud going, and Boltar
   from being broke ;)
	The items can have a time life.  Perhaps 3 to 4
   months long (to keep donations comming).  This way
   the players can feel like they are getting something
   of value and return for their donation.  Other than 
   the 'thrill and excitement' of playing Nirvana.

   I am thinking of using three tiers for donations items

   $35 donation:  A whet stone.  A stone that can sharpen
                  a players own weapons for no cost or a
                  pair of infra red goggles (that do not
                  need to be worn) to see in the dark.
                 Autoloads.

   $50 donation:  Enchanted Pocket.  A bag with no weight
                  restriction that autoloads.
  
   $100 donation: House.  Just like a hotel room, but it's
                  a house.  Can store 6 items, and bank 
                  80k in coins.

	These are just ideas I came up with, I am going to
   let this toss around to the wizards and see what everyone
   thinks and any other ideas you can come up with.
