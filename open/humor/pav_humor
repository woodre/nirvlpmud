Fellow Magi,
   The 'management' has seen fit to close this guild for 'illegal' code.
I am told that if I 'fix' the code and have the guild reviewed by a
senior wizard then it may be reopened.  I have gone through this enough
times now that I'm not really sure I want to reopen the guild ... however,
I realize how unfair this is to all the players who have invested so much
time and energy to this guild.  I will do what I can to get the guild
reopened, my time is very limited, and it takes the 'management' forever
to approve code, but I will work as fast as I can.
Thank you,
        Pavlik
