Note regarding pclean.c

To allow the tool to work properly, the tool must be
copied to the player directory that you wish to clean
files from. Thus, if you are Mizan, you would copy
/open/dune/pclean.c to somewhere in /players/mizan/...

Updates:
- results are now nicely sorted
- the tool is safer to use: it only cleans .o files
