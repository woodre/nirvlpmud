From green go w,w,w,w,n,n,n,w,w,w,n,in,touch orb,say fallen.
  Talk to tyborlek, say story, say demons, say how you can help, 
  say where is the place where the talisman is.

To get the pieces:
  go e,e,n,n,nw,n,n,nw,n,n,ne,nw,n,w,n,kill guard,enter tower,u,u,u.kill auseth
  WIZNOTE: the new version, there is a secret exit in the east room, plus
           an extra exit that leads to the top of the tower.
           goto /players/zeus/realm/d/NEW/tower7.c
  move rug, go d,d,d,d,n,enter vortex
  now, you want to go to each 'p' room and kill the planar demon there.
  3 of them will have spirits which in turn have pieces of the talisman.
  See map of area below.   (FYI, all demons block movement for players.)
