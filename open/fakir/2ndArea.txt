   My second area, as requested, will be primarily for those level five and under.
In fact, it will be protected by hard code or an 'unkillable' monster so higher level
players cannot enter and wipe out all the small monsies.  It is rather silly to build
areas for newbies to gain coins and experience only to have upper level players clean
the area in a matter of moments.
     The Whispering Woods has 31 rooms total, with complete discriptions and a
group of add_actions which will allow players to interact with their surroundings 
and "discover" hidden monsters in the vegetation of the woods.  In other words, some 
monsters will be in the rooms when the player enters, but a bonus monster can be found
in some of the various rooms of the area if the player reads and follows directions.
     There are about 38 monsters total in the 31 rooms...but never more than
a total of three to a single room, including hidden monsters.  Most of the monsters
give items rather than coins...or at least a combination of items and coins so
the player will need to take booty to a shop part way through the area.  This also 
means he will have to find his way out and back again.  I plan to put a small shop in
close proximity to the area so the journey will not be a long one...but at least it
will take some time and effort to gain all the value within the area itself.
     The theme of the area is one of fantasy...the inhabitants being fairy folk. Most
of the mobs will wield a weapon, though it is of very low value and power.  It is my 
desire to make a newbie area that will not bore the player, but rather be something
which will teach them how to approch the larger more difficult areas in the realm.
I realize we dont have a lot of true newbies here...but I still feel the direction
is a good one to pursue.
     I have also added a few human woodcutters into the area, as well as a few animals
that might normally be found in a woods.
     I ran a maxed level five test char through the entire area when it was 90% done, 
and gained a total of 3,380 coins, and 2760 exp pts.  He had a 19wc weapon and ac of 5.
     Below is a chart of the monsters, thier names, class, etc.
