    The Brandywine Inn has a total of 32 rooms with complete discriptions.
It consists of a two story inn with a one room basement.  Main floor of inn
has approx. 21 rooms including a kitchen, pantry, and stairs up and down.
The upper floor of the inn has six guest rooms, five occupied by guests,
one room having a hidden aggressive monster.  A player must search to find
it, and the room disc. hints one might be near.  The bar area in the inn is
interesting, as it has bran.c who guards a cashbox of some value.  Bran must
be killed to obtain the cashbox.  The focal part of the main floor area is
a 'gleeman' or traveling entertainer.  He is a level 20 with an ac2 cloak
which has been designed with secret pockets.
     Most of the higher level monsters in this area have at least a decent
spell special.  The two level 20 monsters are relatively difficult for most
players.  
     One interesting aspect of some of the treasure items is that the coins
given as treasure are contained in a 'purse' which must be opened and the 
coins 'snatched' from the purse.  
     Many of the monsters have been built with random stats and random coin
treasures inside the purse to provide some variety and interest.
     One treasure in room 31 is hidden and must be searched for.  It is a
'jade statue' and can be obtained at no cost or battle.  It is a valuable
treasure item, worth about 1k at a shop.  However, if taken, it will set
a players crime flag.  There is a warning in the disc. of the statue which
more or less points this out.
     There is also a coin purse hidden in room24 which can be searched for
and found at no cost...but coins are low and the search is very specific, 
so a player must read fairly deep to find it.  I figure thats worth a reward.
     The basement room will eventually become the entry to a secret area
know as "the ways".  This will be a very high level, dangerous path of random
rooms which lead to other areas of my realms as well as any other wizards 
who wish to have a 'waygate'.
     Eventually, the Inn will be one building in a small village known as 
'The Two Rivers' and no longer an area unto itself.  In turn, the village
will be but a small part of a realm which is based upon a book by the author
Robert Jordan...called "The Eye of the World".  There will be areas added 
such as "the boarderlands" and "skull mountain" and "tar valon".
     I am also planning a newbie area in the boarderlands which will be
protected from higher level players.

     I ran a test char through the entire area.  I used a level 19 dervish
duel wielding my aielstaffs. (/players/fakir/blands/OBJ/aielstaff.c)
I used honeycomb and lemonade and ale as heals, and had an ac of 3. Net 
result was thus....exp gained by killing all in realm...31,655 exp pts.
                   coins gained (taking all treasures)   - 365 coins tot.
The area is a net 0 gain on coins for most single high level players, and a 
rather severe loss of coins for most low levels.  Exp gain for cleaning the
area total seems in line with most other areas, or even much lower.

     Below is a chart of all the characters, the rooms they are located in, and 
a listing of the items gained by killing them.  I have enjoyed building this
area as a first project, and look forward to building some additional areas
that will hopefully surpass this small effort.  I submit the Inn as a first
project and display of my work and respectfully ask it be put into play.
