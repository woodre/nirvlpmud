[18:29] glaxgor11889: she hates drama then she picked the wrong guy rofl
[18:29] glaxgor11889: worm's life is the most drama i have ever seen in my life
[18:30] Kimmy Jinatsu: actually worms stuff on nirv doesnt interfere with his rl
[18:30] glaxgor11889: rofl nirvana has nothing to do when he is on the hit list of a couple of people hired by people who hate him
[18:31] Kimmy Jinatsu: blah
[18:31] Kimmy Jinatsu: is that what hes says?
[18:31] glaxgor11889: no thats what iu have found from his background check
[18:31] glaxgor11889: and talking to my connections everywhere
[18:33] Kimmy Jinatsu: Ok so why you checking up on Josh
[18:34] Kimmy Jinatsu: Why would you check up on someone you don't know.
[18:35] Kimmy Jinatsu: I mean its just a game, if it was irl, i mean I would understand someone checking up on someone else, do you have a hit out on him?
[18:35] glaxgor11889: because i check everyone
[18:35] Kimmy Jinatsu: You check up on me?
[18:36] glaxgor11889: i don't make hits
[18:36] glaxgor11889: i usually am the one that is hired rofl
[18:36] glaxgor11889: nah
[18:36] Kimmy Jinatsu: why not
[18:36] glaxgor11889: i know u and ur cool
[18:36] Kimmy Jinatsu: heh
[18:36] Kimmy Jinatsu: right
[18:37] glaxgor11889: i even checked jen before i went out with her
[18:37] glaxgor11889: i just check everyone
[18:37] glaxgor11889: except you
[18:37] Kimmy Jinatsu: So check me
[18:37] glaxgor11889: rofl
[18:37] glaxgor11889: i have used up my last check for the day with worm
[18:37] Kimmy Jinatsu: I wanna see exactly what you know without me having to tell you
[18:37] Kimmy Jinatsu: Right.
[18:38] glaxgor11889: i have no more background checks for the next week rofl
[18:38] glaxgor11889: my access is limited now
[18:39] Kimmy Jinatsu: So what did you find out about Jen
[18:39] Kimmy Jinatsu: And Josh>?
[18:41] glaxgor11889: can't say sorry
[18:41] glaxgor11889: all my access stay in my laptop
[18:41] Kimmy Jinatsu: I knew you would say that
[18:42] glaxgor11889: hey top secret files i can't say shit more then what i said
[18:42] Kimmy Jinatsu: How can you check on someone who's last name you don't know
[18:42] glaxgor11889: i just need the ip address and i can find out all info on them
[18:43] glaxgor11889: and a couple of my friends are tracers
[18:43] Kimmy Jinatsu: yeah yak now I used to do that too..
[18:44] glaxgor11889: they trace ips from anyone i tell them to if i give them the game i am playing they give me ip adresses and i check the info of anyone who logs from there
[18:45] Kimmy Jinatsu: Im still not impressed.
[18:47] Kimmy Jinatsu: You can trace ips, but only to the point of origin, then you have to call the company whos name is listed and ask them for the info, you cant just load up someones IP and get all that info...I have done it before, but that was ONE time, because I had someone stalking me. Prove to me you can do all this and I will believe you, when i have someone knocking on my door saying hey Roy sent me then I will believe you
[18:50] Kimmy Jinatsu: So which is it, are you a gangster or wiccan because um if you were wiccan you would fucking know that they dont just go out and put hits on people, they respect all life..
[18:51] Kimmy Jinatsu: You are an idiot. I believe everything Jen says about you, you are a liar. Grow up.
