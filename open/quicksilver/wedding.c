            The harp begins playing softly in the background as the Goddess 
            of marriage, Hera, enters the chapel.

            Hera raises her hands and all become quiet.

            KENNETH enters the room and stands beside Hera.  You turn as 
            you hear the door open to the chapel to see ELIZABETH standing
            there.  

            You feel the love in the air as ELIZABETH begins walking 
            slowly down the isle towards her beloved.

            KENNETH takes ELIZABETHS hand and turns and faces Hera.  

            Hera speaks:  Friends we are gathered here at this hour to
            witness and to celebrate the coming together of two separate 
            lives.

            We have come to join this man Kenneth and this woman, Elizabeth
            in marriage, to be with them and to rejoice with them in the
            making of this important commitment.

            The essence of this commitment is not to be entered into lightly,
            but rather undertaken with great consideration and respect for
            both the other person and oneself.

            The physical union of marriage is one of life's greatest joys,
            and when this is combined with real friendship and a union of
            spirit, it is infinitely enhanced.

            The day-to-day companionship, the pleasure of doing things
            together, the delight of exchanging experiences, are all a
            central part of what a man and a woman who love each other 
            can share.

            We are here today to celebrate the love which KENNETH and 
            ELIZABETH have for each other.  Out of their desire to have
            their marriage be more than a bond between two people they 
            declare that their love is an expression of their commitment
            to improving the quality of life on Nirvana.  

            KENNETH, Do you agree to join your life with ELISABETH, not 
            merely as her husband, but as her friend, her lover, and her 
            confidant.  To be the shoulder she leans on, the rock she 
            rests on, the companion of her life.  To walk your path with 
            her and make a your home in her heart from this day forward?

            ELIZABETH, Do you agree to join your life with KENNETH, not 
            merely as his wife, but as his friend, his lover and his 
            confidant.  To be the shoulder he leans on, the rock he 
            rests on, the companion of his life.  To walk your path with 
            him and make a your home in his heart from this day forward?

            These rings are a symbol of the unbroken unity of love to be 
            manifested in your married life. As they are made in the form
            of a circle, they represent the truth of that law of life,
            as we give to each other, we receive from each other.

            Insomuch as you KENNETH and you ELIZABETH have consented 
            together in the bonds of matrimony before your family and 
            friends present, and have pledged your faith and love, each 
            to the other, I pronounce you husband and wife.

            KENNETH, you may kiss the bride!
