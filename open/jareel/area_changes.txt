Here's something to go on..  keep in mind that it's only the long
descriptions so far..  I didn't look at the add_items or anything
yet.  I just figured you'd want something, since you've been
waiting for a while now.  I'll get you more as soon as I can.

If there's stuff in here that you've caught on you own since the last
time I looked at it, of course disregard it..  some of these I looked
at a couple weeks ago..  *8)

    There's something about this desc I can't get my head around..  it
        doesn't sound right and I don't know why...  I'm thinkin it has
        something to do with the columns foreboding chaos..  I don't
        think that's the right use of some words, but since I don't know 
        why, or what idea you were trying to get across, I don't know 
        what to suggest..  try to re-word it and we'll see..  or catch
        me and tell me what you wanted to get across and we can work 
        on it.
