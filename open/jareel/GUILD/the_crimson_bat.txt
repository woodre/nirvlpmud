The Guild of "The Crimson Bat"

History
    The Crimson Bat once was a nutural animal, but was horrible mutated by the flood of 
  chaos which infected the world after 'The War of the Gods'.  It grew to a tremendous 
  size, and glowed with chaotic forces.  The glow was the Glowspot, and it was a source
  of chaotic power.
  
    To feed these energies, the Bat consumed enormous amounts of food and for survival 
  required the power from intelligent beings.    
  
    During the first age, the Crimson Bat roamed the world without restraint.  It descended
  upon towns and cities without warning, devouring the people.  The Crimson Bat ran into the
  Hero Arkat who banished the Bat from this realm during the first age.  The Bat was not seen
  during the second age of man. 
  
    In the golden age of the Luner empire (The third age) before the Red Goddess ascended to
  immortality.  The Red Goddess brought new radicle ideas to the realm of man.  Filled with 
  inspiration the followers conquererd and converted the world around them to the words of 
  the Red Goddess.  While the Red Goddess was on a Hero Quest to forge her place amongst the 
  pantheon of the gods, several war lords attacked her lands while she was away besieging her
  capitol in the heart of her empire.
 
    She returned to the capitol riding the monstrocity of the Crimson Bat.  Enemy Forces Knew
  great Terror, and died in regiments as the bat made war.  Many of the 'lucky' survivors went
  mad.  Lunar historians refer to this battle as the first battle of chaos, and use that day,
  Freezeday as the feeding day for the crimson bat.
  
Runic associations
  The Death Rune - Symbolized as a Cross or a sword, this rune represents the bats constant
                   hunger and lust for blood.
  The Rune of Chaos - Symbolized as a two half circles over laped.  This represents the
                      birth and just how chaotic this creature is.
  The Rune of the Luner Empire - Symbolized as a circle with a dot in the center, this 
                                 represents the bats tie to the Red Goddess and how she
                                 brought this great beast back from the abyss.

Theme
  This is a guild built on the bloodshed of non-believers.  All men and women who do not worship
  the bat or the Red Goddess should not exist on this plane of existence.  Evil does not start
  to explain the heart and soul of this guilds followers.  This sect of the Luner empire was set
  up to feed the bat.  Keeping the bat satiated is the primary focus of this guild, even if it is
  at the expense of their own well being.
  
Drawbacks
  The Bat must maintain satiation or a guardian will warn the Bats followers and the followers will
  have 30 minutes to satiate the bat.  If Satiation is not fullfilled the bat will eat causeing the
  players or players logged in at that time deaths untill satiation is fullfilled.  Six Player deaths
  for every player logged on in this guild (I.E. 1 Person logged in, the bat will eat 6 times, 2 people 
  logged in the bat will eat each player 6 times, meaning six deaths) If a player quits out when the 
  bat needs to be satiated the bat will eat that player 10 times and the hunger will be satiated.
      
  Players must have their PK Flag set, or take 30 points of damage every round of combat.
    
  Players must maintain an evil alignment.
  
  Players leaving the Crimson Bat will be eated and Banished from the realm.
