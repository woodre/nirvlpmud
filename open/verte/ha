You can toss your ALTS files. Forget it. Why did we have it?

Because this isn't a closed community.
It's supposed to be developers and player characters
not being separate - treating others with respect.
I'm sick of wizards talking shit with
their player characters to other wizards or other players
and getting away with it. I'm actually pretty saddened
that I received so much negative mail about this matter
because it shows that you all still have an extremely high
level of mistrust towards one another. Why else would you NEED
to be anonymous? No one complained when Mizan had NDML active.
And that was much more severe - this was simply a matter of
YOU registering your own characters and putting them in a textfile.
Not tracking all sorts of information about your play habits.
I guess I could have added something automated, but I didn't
want to be underhanded- I guess this is what I get!

If you really want this mud to succeed, people need to
rethink the way they treat/talk to people. Otherwise
it will continue to exponentially stagnate and eventually die.
 In Zeus's words: 
 if(!wizards || !players || 
  ((int)fun->query_fun() <= 0)) return (::no_mud());

I have zero interest in explaining this to you.
In any case, you don't have to keep an ALTS file;
you don't have to do anything I say, because I'm simply
done saying anything more. From now on, I will cease
enforcing policy, encouraging development, or doing anything here.

If I were to assign people to take over, it would look
something like this:

Fred - level 10000
Earwax - level 5000

Pain/Forbin - level 1000 Gameplay
Illarion/Vital - level 1000 Technical

Francesco - level 1000 Area Dev/Revitalization
Sparkle - level 100 Area Approval

Fakir - level 1000 Policy
Stardream - level 700 Player Affairs

Thanks!
