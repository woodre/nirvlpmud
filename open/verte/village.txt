Fishing Village:    17	24	14	350	2100

	A small fishing village is in distress. A small group of organized Orc's have
been kidnapping the residents of the village. There are, however, no warriors are amoung the 
village, and people are too afraid of the Orcs to go after them. The outpost is a few miles 
from the village. The people of the village are fishermen, hunters, and holy men. There will 
not be to fight in this section of the area.

Orc Outpost

The Orc Outpost is small fortress. It was designed train Orci to fight and take commands. Lord
Sirion has formed this area to build an army and march across Nirvana. He is a power hungry commander
and dreams of nothing execpt total annilation of any race other than Orci. This training ground is
built on a plateau with only one path to the top. It is defensivly fortifide and difficult for any
army to penetrate its deepest reaches. The occuping army is a small, but growning force. There will
be a range of weapons and armors here. Anything you might fight on a military outpost.

* Note: each of these will be a seperate mob, but these stats will remain the same throughout 
        each of them. the coins will be coins or wep (value), not both.

The last 3 of these mobs will be in a hidden room, and hard to find. I would like to set up some
kind of attack special, that if Lord Sirion is attacked the other 2 will attack as well. Lord Sirion
will have the directions to the cave in the mountains where he holds the captives.

One of the hunters in the fishing village will barter the Orcish weapons for coins. They will also
be usable weps as well. Nothing like the Gordie stick, but nice wep's none the less ;).

Weapons:                       WC         Value              Specials           

Orcish WarAxe                  17         4000                (3) returns. WarAxe will do fire|damage
Orcish Spear                   17         7000                (3) returns. Spear will do physical|damage
Orcish WarHammer               17         8000                (3) returns. WarHammer will do physical|damage
Orcish WarSword                18         10000               (4) returns. WarSword will do magical|damage


There might be various items created for themeatic purposes, but nothing usable as a weapon or armor.
If you have any questions or suggestions please feel free to let me know. Any help would be appricated.
