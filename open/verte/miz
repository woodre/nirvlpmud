I appreciate the heads up. It sounds cliche, but i am done with the game as a wizard.
I could go into the specifics but it isn't really necessary.
 
Caelin should stay if she is being useful and it doesn't really bother me at this point.
I actually am cool with Boltar too, there's no anger or resentment from my end about it all.
 
It's just that all of the fight and motivation for me to do useful things on the game disappeared once Caelin went insta. I'm just not inspired by the game anymore.
 
Also the resistance/armor i once had to the typical politics and issues like wizards leaking info to players is gone. I used to relish those engagements, it was fun and adventurous but now i would rather just not bother with it.
 
For now i'm just content to lurk and not get involved with anything.
 
Thanks for listening though,
