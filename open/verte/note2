You may have noticed that Fastkill/Nameless/Akira/etc. have been forced to start
over again as utter novices. This is because they have refused to abide by the
basic rules of Nirvana that the vast majority of you are fine with. That is, not
passing equipment or money between your characters (no matter how veiled), and
not trying to hack, break into, or otherwise use anyone else's characters.

Another case in point is our old friend Billy. Billy has decided that it is a
good idea to either give his characters away or lie about his friend's hack.
(As well as openly refuse to follow the rules set down by Boltar).

Please, do not engage in character sharing or multiplaying.

Take the time to read and re-read the rules defined in 'help rules' through the
associated help files so you do not end up like these poor, lying bastards.
If you need clarification, ask a wizard :)

And if you do unwisely decide to engage in these sorts of actions, please have
the wisdom not to lie to the wizards who confront you about it. It's very insulting.
