i. Outline:
 Essentially our goal here is to re-introduce old, classic guilds
that were the staples of Nirvana in their individual time periods.
This will allow old players to re-experience the very first guilds
they joined and allow newbies an even wider array of guild choice.
 This will involve a variety of duties from simple reorganization
to coding to administration once the guild is up and running.
 What we don't want to do is completely re-author the guild.  We
want to keep the themes and general guild structure together as it
was originally intended.  Add-ons are great, however.

ii. Guilds:
  Black Circle Mage                Glaendor*

Warriors, Symbiotes: Both of these guilds need a replacement as well
 and "transference" for those that joined either of these guilds.

iii. Areas to focus:
(consider this your bible of re-code, but it's not very complete)
[1] Preservation: Preserve the theme of the guild at all costs.
[2] Aesthetics: Give that guild a nice ANSI polish, but don't
    oversaturate it.  Eliminate typos and increase verbiage.
[3] Legality: Make sure objects are legal.  This is an obvious
    one, but the ancient code may have been legal back then,
    but isn't any longer.
[4] Documentation: My major stipulation is that a writeup must
    be performed before a guild is approved.  Please check out
    previous docs in /open/GUILDS/ [I think].  Keep this updated
    frequently.
                        and most importantly..
[5] Fun: Have it.

iii. Lib work:
 Mudlib duties will be handled by me, Vertebraker. Let me know
if you need something.
 I have a general plan for organization that will help in
general guild structure as well.  I will be creating std
guild objects, daemons, and a channel object.  That is a
long-time priority.  What is most important now is getting
these guilds up and running, so I will be first assisting in
loading the objects up and getting them running into player
testing.

iv. Joining the project:
 Let me know and I'll add you on to wherever you decide.

v. Approval:
 Write a nice document explaining the overview of the guild.
Mail me requesting approval. I'll go as fast as I can. :)
