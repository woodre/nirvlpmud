** movies cannot be ranked if you do not finish them **

10/10 - cinematic perfection. no way to improve it over the source
        material. strong feelings [hate/love/fear] during the film.
9/10  - a step away from greatness. almost reaching the cinematic
        apex, but there is some fundamental flaw keeping it from
        achieving that knock.
8/10  - a great film worth owning and watching again. entertaining
        in a major way in some facet.
7/10  - interesting elements, but doesn't quite come together to
        realize itself. a "good" film.
6/10  - a watchable film on a rainy day.
5/10  - there's other things you should be doing. like cleaning
        your bathroom or doing the laundry. feh.
        
4/10  - you're agitated 'cause you just wasted a couple hours.
3/10  - you're angry now and want your money back.
2/10  - beyond angry. you're now physically abusive and throwing
        furniture. you may have destroyed the movie itself at this
        point.
1/10  - you want to put a gun into your mouth.
0/10  - you can't vote because you are dead.
