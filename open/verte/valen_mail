It's true.  The nerfing by earwax was excellent.  I fought Oz.  Who is only 
guild level 6 bloodfist.  I was barely able to do any damage but I was 
taking damage very easily.  Even in the Gedan stance I was getting owned by 
Oz.  He used only 10 kits while I used up over 22-25 kits and a wocket 
heal. I can understand taking the damage.  What brothers me most is that 
the Samurai don't have the spirit of the warrior anymore.   No bladestorm 
or the ability to do damage.  Not to be feared or respected.  Earwax says 
bladestorm is illegal because of the area of effect has no real rule for 
it.  I can see that more players would punish the Samurai in a 2v1 fight.  
Bladestorm would assist the Sam 
Samurai's most powerful spell.  Earwax also said the dervish should set the 
standards for the highest possibly offense because they have no defensive. 
Which I can understand. Earwax said 
because he would like to nerf the Samurai even more.The bloodfist already 
do serious amount of damage and take it rather well.  The Samurai should be 
able to dish it out.    Yes.  In a 1v1 fight.  A maxed out bloodfist should 
take down a maxed out Samurai.  But a maxed out Samurai should be able to 
take down a guild level 6 bloodfist.  Obiviously, there are some problems. 
Bloodfist seem to get defensive and offensive skills.    While Samurai 
don't get either because both offensive and defensive were nerfed with no 
bladestorm.  I ask you.  Is what earwax really said true?  Do you think it 
its really fair that non maxed bloodfist could smack around a +100 Samurai? 
Also, Earwax said that senior wizes should be working on the LPMUD and 
not making new guilds.I love the new guilds.  It really put a breath of 
life into Nirvana for me.    Your decision.  I ask that you help making a 
compromise from where Earwax put the Samurai at and what you had them at 
after all your nerfing
