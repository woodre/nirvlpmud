Yup, still alive and kicking... how are things going
with you?  I'm still in school, got a way to go
though, working on my masters and then doctorate.
Just put together a new computer, athlon 64, etc etc.
Good for gaming, bit of an overkill for
wordprocessing.  Tony is out in california right now,
he is doing well.  He has another year to go in the
navy.  Hmm... i'm still working on a pen and paper
RPG, which is my only creative outlet right now, but
it is going well.  Found an artist to illustrate it,
working on it in my freetime.  So, where you living
now?  You still mudding?  School?  Tell all, and hope
to hear from you soon,
  Matt
