Ok:

 The traditional way to do strings:

"Hi mom, how are you. Boy I'm having a great time in sunny\n"+
"Montana. How's that new Johnny Cash album? Ok, Bye!\n";

 Ok, the problem with the traditional way is that it increases
 memory. Why? It's called concatenation. Basically by adding
 strings together it creates 3 strings, not 1. And it fails
 to remove the previous 2 strings from memory.

 Consider this:

String A: "Hi mom, how are you. Boy I'm having a great time in sunny\n"
String B: "Montana. How's that new Johnny Cash album? Ok, Bye!\n"

 Now add A and B. You get String C. But A and B are never removed.

 So the best way is this:

"Hi mom, how are you. Boy I'm having a great time in sunny\n\
Montana. How's that new Johnny Cash album? Ok, Bye!\n";

 It creates only one string.

 Now the only things to look out for in this format:

Use of the \ character for strings is convoluted. Certain characters
    that follow it, such as the letter 'n' do certain things. In
    the case of 'n', this means to print a new line. Other usages
    are \" for printing quotes, or \t to print a tab.

But if it is not immediately followed by a character, it will ignore the
    rest of that line of code and go immediately to the rest.  This
    still provides adequate formatting.

Hope this makes sense!
