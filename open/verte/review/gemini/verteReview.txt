[~/myarea/room/main] -item 'flowers': daffodils spelled wrong.
[~/myarea/room/main] -missing item 'flower pots' / 'pots'
[~/myarea/room/main] -There is a smell from the long desc and from the item 'flowers', but I can't 'smell' either.
[~/myarea/room/main] -..so to fix this, add this in reset(): odors_msg = ({ "flowers", "Whatever", "main", "Whatever" });  Mail me if you need help with this.
[~/myarea/room/main] -missing item street
[~/myarea/room/main] -This doesn't make sense: "a plain street that the ground has been chip sealed." Should read something like: "This is just a plain street *where* the ground has been chip sealed."
[~/myarea/room/main] -'The buildings to your left right' = 'The buildings to your left and right'
[~/myarea/room/main] -Where is the school in the distance? To the north? To the south? Where?
[~/myarea/room/main] -Again, reference the "food smell" in your odors_msg array.  When I type 'smell', I should be able to have at least an idea of what smell that is and where it should be coming from.
[~/myarea/room/main] -intimadating = intimidating
[~/myarea/room/main] -item "ground": has an extra \n at the end, unnecessary.
[~/myarea/room/main] -missing ending . in long desc
[~/myarea/room/main] -i can't go south.. is that going to be the entrance to the area?
[~/myarea/room/main2] -'familar' = "familiar"
[~/myarea/room/main2] -need item store/game store/video game store
[~/myarea/room/main2] -add a smell here
[~/myarea/room/main2] -also should be able to 'listen' for the voices
[~/myarea/room/gamestore] -need a 'listen' here.
[~/myarea/room/gamestore] -"You are in awe at all the shelves" = "You are in awe at all of the shelves"
[~/myarea/room/gamestore] -item "counter" has an extra \n
[~/myarea/room/mpcroom] -need a 'listen' here for the buzzing and clicking
[~/myarea/room/mpcroom] -also a 'smell' for the silicon
[~/myarea/room/mpcroom] -OK. I JUST NOTICED IN THE CODE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN USING MY ADD_LISTEN AND SO FORTH.  THAT'S COOL BUT YOU'RE USING IT WRONG.  add_listen() and so forth doesn't support multiple syntax.  Needs to be something like add_listen("buzzing", "You hear the buzz of transformers and other components"); and another one of those with a first argument of "buzz"
[~/myarea/room/mpcroom] -ALSO.  DO NOT INHERIT /open/gemini/inherit/vroom.c  inherit /players/vertebraker/closed/std/room.  I make frequent changes to my code and don't want to be updating everyone else's.  Also inheriting from /open/gemini/ is bad because other wizards can alter it.
[~/myarea/room/yankerburger] -You should add a healshop at Yanker Burger.  This area is quite boring ;)
[~/myarea/room/yankerburger] -need item "seats", "seating area"
[~/myarea/room/highschool] -'mr.hand' should be 'Mr. Hand' in all cases, properly capitalized
[~/myarea/room/highschool] -'teachers desk' = 'teacher's desk'
[~/myarea/room/highschool] -i can't read the blackboard. What does it say?
[~/myarea/room/highschool] -I can't spin the globe. But it spins.  Why not?
[~/myarea/room/highschool] -i should be able to look at franklin, edison, and roosevelt and get a description of each one of them.
[~/myarea/room/main] -make sure you add smell/listen "main"'s for EACH of these rooms where applicable [where i can smell or hear ANYTHING to hint me at what specifically to smell/listen to]
[~/myarea/room/la] -heh. sweet. add a listen/smell to this.
[~/myarea/room/muppetland] -chairs and a couch: But I can't look at them
[~/myarea/room/muppetland] -Ms.Piggy should be "Ms. Piggy" in all cases
[~/myarea/room/muppetland] -need item lighting
[~/myarea/room/muppetland] -'undescrible' = 'indescribable.  if it's indescribable, why is it attempted to be described? it has to be described in some way or another. Is it nasty?  Does it smell like popcorn from the people in the theater?
[~/myarea/room/muppetland] -one MAJOR note: the line lengths of your rooms are very sketch.  they need to be standardized in length.  in this case, the length goes from 67/70/59/48/58 .. we should be looking at a 70 max and all lines should be roughly 65-70 characters long.  Type 'ruler' to check.  70 is the standard.
[~/myarea/room/main2] -I think i hit the majors for now.  When you're done with all this, mail me or let me know.
[~/myarea/room/main2] -Also.. minimum for a first area should be 15-20 rooms.  You will need to add on to this area before it goes in the game.
[~/myarea/room/main2] -Do yourself a favor and clone /obj/wizbook .. type 'read area1', 'read area2', 'read area3', and 'read area4' and try to get a better idea of what we're going for nowadays.
