		I. Two-handed weapons.

	I. The only function I have currently is for two-handed weapons, but it
		makes sure all the checks exist.  Simply add a:
		set_two_handed(1);
	   And voila, your weapon is now two handed [cannot wear a shield].
	   This accounts for Dervish/Warrior code as well.  Standard.
