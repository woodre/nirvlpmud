Hiyo,

We need to start testing on the LD port again.

IP address is the same, port is 3535.

We will run double xp day for those characters who participate, and
there will likely be free custom prizes for those who continually
submit bug reports and so forth.

Basically log in, break shit [find bugs/exploits/etc.],

if a wiz is on LD:

1) Report it to the wiz 

or if the wiz is idle/no wizes on:

2) Report with "bug <report>" - with
as much detailed information as you can.
