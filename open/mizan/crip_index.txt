An outline of what is going on here...

[SECTION I]
Please read the contents of [crip_notes.txt] first. They sum up what 
is happening. If you are really bored or are checking my conduct please 
proceed further. Otherwise, those notes pretty much sum up what has happened
for sections II and III and you can just skip to section IV.


Unless otherwise indicated, these files are captures of my terminal session.
With an ANSI-compliant text reader you can see exactly what i saw on my
screen- or just use the 'more' command to view through to get full ANSI. 

[SECTION II]
The contents of [crip_setup01.txt] contains all the setup for what had
occurred that got Crip pissed off. In summary:

- Crip is fighting a monster that was the setup from crip_notes.txt.
  He cannot kill it.
- Crip has managed to piss off several other wizards in the process
  of a run-and-gun flamewar. I am not involved at this point.
- Mizan has no fucking clue how to use the 'xtitle' command :)
- Things don't get particularly exciting until about halfway through 
  the file when i goto crip and watch him fight for a while.
- Crip had died in combat.

This file is much more boring but provides setup. It is not advised 
to scan this file unless you are really bored. Repeat! :)

[SECTION III]
The contents of [crip_part02.txt] illustrate me trying to explain to 
Crip what had happened. You will note that he does not like what he hears.

A summary of what happens in this file:
- Crip and i have at first what is a conversation in tells.
- Crip does not like my answer.
- Conversation moves to channels, escalates in violence.
- Crip quits the polys, says he is leaving the game.
- Violence escalates, I make things worse by baiting him.
- I start imprisoning his character for a time out.
- Some wizard discussion at the end among those currently logged in.

[SECTION IV]
Please see [crip_nitara.txt]. This is the copy of
/players/mizan/logs/snoop/nitara 

Note that in the beginning, it is clear that a girl is playing. 
This is Crip's cousin. From what Sparkle has said, Crip's cousin jessica does
sometime play on this mud. However it quite clear at a certain point it 
sounds like a guy :)

[SECTION V]
This is what happened today, in [crip_part03.txt]. In summary:
- I told Crip via proxy by Billy to stop playing as Nitara
- Crip logs in to deny it, hilarity ensues.
- Characters start getting imprisoned for 'timeouts'.
- At one point he logs in as Nitara. You can see this at the end
  of crip_nitara.txt.

That's where we are now.  
Thanks for reading...
