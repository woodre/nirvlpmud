**Mizan** home
A voice echoes: mizan, level 21 fades into view.
	You are drifting in a ever-changing environment of pure color
  and sounds. Typically, no naturally occuring laws of natural physics
  apply here. Entropy is an sharp understatement.
    There are infinite obvious exits.
A tombstone.
A petrified log.
Ok.
->> 02h
players/mizan/core/home
    You are standing in the Operational Nexus of 02h. Power punches and
  the humming of machines drowns the room, which seemingly extends to an
  infinite expanse. The gleaming, crystalline floors are warm to the touch
  and almost emit a pulsating feeling with you could swear to feeling.
  A spiral staircase on one side of the Nexus leads downstairs to the
  Proving Grounds control area. To the east is the laboratory access
  junction.
    There are four obvious exits: out, north, east and down
A giant black mainframe computer.

/players/mizan/core/02h/room01.c
    You are standing in the northern side of the Operational Nexus.
  There are more machines here, but they are smaller in size, and seem
  to be running much quieter. Unlike other parts of the Nexus, some
  chattering noises which seem to be verbal communications can vaguely
  be heard. It appears to be coming strongest from the west.
    There are three obvious exits: west, east and south

/players/mizan/core/02h/room03.c
    You stand in a quieter section of the Operational Nexus. Before
  you are a large array of what appear to be power cables and punches.
  Gleaming, hard plastic-like material forms a barrier between you and.
  certain death if you were to touch the exposed connections at the
  termination junctions. Further east is a different part of the Nexus,
  as it seems to be bathed in a soft orange light instead of the crystal
  bright white lamprails that envelope the rest of the area. To the
  north is a sign proclaiming the Ops center for the Monster's Guild.
    There are three obvious exits: west, east and north

    This is a brightly lit area in the Operational Nexus. Devices sit
  here in a neatly packed cluster in the center of the room. Additional
  power punches can be seen in a lineup servicing these devices.
  Yes, all of the equipment used for operating the Monsters' guild
  lives here. You notice that things are very clean around here, despite
  the added activity caused by all the monsters. There is a shimmering
  portal leading down, presumably to the locker rooms of the Monster's
  Guild. In addition, there is a portal north to the staging area of the
  next generation series.
    There are three obvious exits: south, north and down
A network server named (monster-daemon).
The Nexus of Power.
A network server named (waypoint-daemon).
A network server named (tactical-daemon).
A network server named (popman-daemon).

    This is a large, brightly lit but ultimately very cold and unforgiving
  sort of a room. There are no windows, only large, heavy looking doors that
  face the north and west exits. A shimmering portal lies open to the south.
  Equipment and materials lie in large organized bins all over the eastern
  wall. Large workstations stand with half-completed projects in the works.
  For some reason, you are very nervous standing in this room.
    There is one obvious exit: south

>>*******************************************************<<

VERY IMPORTANT: 

*CLARIFICATION* The PK restriction i am talking about is in regards
to wandering in PK areas, not the ability to PK other players.
Please check the recenty news articles in guild.announce for details.

The PK restriction has been lifted. This issue is closed and dealt 
with. Please read the updated information in: 'info playerkilling',
'info playerkilling2', and lastly 'info playerkilling3'. I plan on
really ironing down the language because i have no choice in it, so
these documents will be subject to further changes and clarifications.

Sorry things have to be this way. Please read the news for
further detail. The effects of a single person not thinking
things through, and then being unrepentant about it has forced
me to act like this :(
