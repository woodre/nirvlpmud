This is in response to Cleipa. I don't even know why i am wasting my time
with this, but it is here for posterity.

>>The Short story:
Cleipa has not accepted the simple fact that my guild has some fairly simple
rules established for it, and if you don't like that, then too bad. The US
Constitution does not apply for it. Sorry. Tavern/bouncer rules in effect.
Now you make this generalized blanket accusation for which you have no
real case for. 

>>The Long story:
Southstar, L19+53 (his friend) arranged for a hitman style execution of a L9
player. SS admitted to it, and i gave SS the choice of punishment:

1) Quit the polymorphs, and the case is closed.
2) Stay in the guild but so long as he is in it, no polys can venture to
   PK enabled realms without suffering damage (5hp/hb).
He chose poorly. However the predicted effect after less than a day was that
he was pressured to quit the guild.

Cleipa now has the nerve to tell me that SS did nothing wrong, and that i am
in no position to decide this case. As far as i am concerned this is done.

Then Cleipa quits the guild voluntarily in a fairly pathetic display of
protest. What you essentially did was save me the task of banishing myself.

Fascinating!
Paradoxically yours,
