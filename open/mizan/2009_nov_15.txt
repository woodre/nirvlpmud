Mizan admins: You tell Worm honestly. If you think you're going to be all
buddy-buddy with me after what you tried to pull, think again.
Mizan admins: You tell Worm i dont consider you an 'enemy' or some lame
shit like that, but you are on my shit list.
Mizan admins: You tell Worm and you need to do a whole hell of a lot to
earn your way off of it.
Illarion admins: I don't think he really knows how to do anything but be
charming when he wants something
Mizan admins: and i'm not allowing him to get in the habit of trying to
sweet-talk me
Mizan admins: I think that I may have been the only wiz who was supportive
on almost any project he was willing to try
Mizan admins: emphasis on him, and not jen
Mizan admins: now all he's got is coldwind, and maybe star.
Mizan admins: not belitting them or anything, but he has lost himself
friends over time.
