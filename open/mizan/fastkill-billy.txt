WIZARD BEHAVIORS:

I have been altered that wizards are giving out information on alts, who's
on invis, etc etc. YOU ARE NOT TO DO THIS. Wizard power is for WIZARDS and
not to be shared with players. It's a dewizing offense if it continues.



THE MUD IS FREAKIN' HUGE. DELETE YOUR CRAP!!!

    You are standing in the Operational Nexus of 02h. Power punches and
  the humming of machines drowns the room, which seemingly extends to an
  infinite expanse. The gleaming, crystalline floors are warm to the touch
  and almost emit a pulsating feeling with you could swear to feeling.
  A spiral staircase on one side of the Nexus leads downstairs to the
  Proving Grounds control area. To the east is the laboratory access
  junction.

-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------   

There is one simple rule, if you have more than one character they
MUST be TOTALLY SEPARATE. Sharing of equipment, money, and anything
else is NOT allowed. If both players are on at the same time one 
will be removed, wizard/god's choice.  Also, having one character
dc'd and another active at the same time is considered multiplaying.

Leaving behind money or objects for a second to pick up or
to pass anything through a third player, pet or monster is not legal
and will be considered multiplaying.

Also, there will be NO character sharing, give-aways, etc.
If this is done the transfered character will be placed on inactive
status until its disposition is decided.

There are many reasons for this:
1> more than one character logged in at a time IS CHEATING
[1mMore: (lines [2;37;0m1[1m-[2;37;0m20[1m) [2;37;0m
2> it is against good and honest mudding practice.
3> it takes up extra login slots that can be used by others.
4> it takes up extra cpu time that could be used by others.

The honest player should be offended by such behavior.
IN SUMMATION, ONE LOGIN PER PERSON.

In addition, should you know that two or more characters belong
to the same person you may not use that knowledge in game play.
In other words if a person has character A in guild X the actions
done as that character have no bearing on those of his other 
character B, in guild Z. Separation is a two way street.

over again as utter novices. This is because they have refused to abide by the
basic rules of Nirvana that the vast majority of you are fine with. That is, not
passing equipment or money between your characters (no matter how veiled), and
not trying to hack, break into, or otherwise use anyone else's characters.

Another case in point is our old friend Billy. Billy has decided that it is a
good idea to either give his characters away or lie about his friend's hack.
(As well as openly refuse to follow the rules set down by Boltar).

Please, do not engage in character sharing or multiplaying.

Take the time to read and re-read the rules defined in 'help rules' through the
associated help files so you do not end up like these poor, lying bastards.
If you need clarification, ask a wizard :)

And if you do unwisely decide to engage in these sorts of actions, please have
the wisdom not to lie to the wizards who confront you about it. It's very insulting.

You may have noticed that Fastkill/Nameless/Akira/etc. have been forced to start
over again as utter novices. This is because they have refused to abide by the
basic rules of Nirvana that the vast majority of you are fine with. That is, not
passing equipment or money between your characters (no matter how veiled), and
not trying to hack, break into, or otherwise use anyone else's characters.

Another case in point is our old friend Billy. Billy has decided that it is a
good idea to either give his characters away or lie about his friend's hack.
(As well as openly refuse to follow the rules set down by Boltar).

Please, do not engage in character sharing or multiplaying.

Take the time to read and re-read the rules defined in 'help rules' through the
associated help files so you do not end up like these poor, lying bastards.
If you need clarification, ask a wizard :)

And if you do unwisely decide to engage in these sorts of actions, please have
the wisdom not to lie to the wizards who confront you about it. It's very insulting.

  to be running much quieter. Unlike other parts of the Nexus, some
  chattering noises which seem to be verbal communications can vaguely

  Gleaming, hard plastic-like material forms a barrier between you and.
  certain death if you were to touch the exposed connections at the
  termination junctions. Further east is a different part of the Nexus,
  as it seems to be bathed in a soft orange light instead of the crystal
  bright white lamprails that envelope the rest of the area. To the
  north is a sign proclaiming the Ops center for the Monster's Guild.

**Mizan** [1] read 30
The note is titled 'The Story of Fastkill and Billy(vertebraker)':

You may have noticed that Fastkill/Nameless/Akira/etc. have been forced
to start over again as utter novices. This is because they have refused
to abide by the basic rules of Nirvana that the vast majority of you
comply with. That is, not passing equipment or money between your own
characters (no matter how veiled), and not trying to hack, break into,
or otherwise use anyone else's characters.

Another case in point is our old friend Billy. Billy has decided that
it is a good idea to either give his characters away or lie about his
friend's hack. (As well as openly refuse to follow the rules set down
by Boltar).

Please, do not engage in character sharing or multiplaying.

Take the time to read and re-read the rules defined in 'help rules'
through the associated help files so you do not end up like these
poor, lying bastards. If you need clarification, ask a wizard :)

And if you do unwisely decide to engage in these sorts of actions,
please have the wisdom not to lie to the wizards who confront you
about it. It's very insulting.
