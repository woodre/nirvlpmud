>>> Later on, the catapult is used by Badman.
>>> This is an excerpt from /log/mizan.catapult

Badman hit Rek with a pile of shit.
Badman hit Rek with a pile of shit.
Badman hit Rek with the old town news.
Badman hit Rek with a black water balloon.




>>> Rek complains about the spam on channels.
>>> An interjection- at the time i had noticed Rek had four shitstains
>>> in his inventory (one pile came from a different source).


The Old Town News rockets across the MUD and knocks Rek to the ground!
Rek gossips: used to be 5 of wilmas pies and the person could get jailed
for spam, how bout a similar rule with your stuff mizan?
Rek gossips: because your stuff is worse than pies,it repeatedly spams
Rek gossips: that should be jailable
(gossip) Mizan wonders what the point is.
Vital gossips: Ok, throw Rek in jail
Mizan gossips: Prepare to be schooled.
Mizan gossips: 1) Catapult uses channel junk.
Mizan gossips: 2) Catapult has a 7 second delay before it can be re-armed.
Mizan gossips: 3) Catapult checks for non-teleport rooms.
(gossip) Rek knew that one.
Mizan gossips: 4) Wine and cheese will not be served today.
Badman gossips: heh
Mizan gossips: 5) France Surrenders!
Rek gossips: muffling junk does not turn off your items 
Mizan gossips: Hey, what's that sound?
Mizan gossips: It's the world's smallest violin playing.
A black water balloon rockets across the MUD and knocks Rek to the ground!
(gossip) Badman chuckles
Mizan gossips: Oh yeah, 6) Catapult consumes HPs each time it is used.
Mizan gossips: </school>
(gossip) Badman shrugs
Badman gossips: worth it

it off and went to bed...
Boltar wizs: now vis
Dakeyras wizs: yuck, flex
Mizan wizs: she made offhand comments about coding, on channel star
Dakeyras wizs: hey  bolts, would it be legal for me to jail badman for
Mizan wizs: asked _everyone_ if desting armageddon cancels a reboot
Mizan wizs: No, dake
Gemini wizs: it can mess things up
Mizan wizs: dake i dunno why you're wigging about the catapult
Dakeyras wizs: it's not the catapult
Boltar wizs: um assium doesn't reboot
Dakeyras wizs: it's that i had so many "shit"s on me that half my screen
