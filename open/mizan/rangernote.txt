The note is titled 'Idiocy(Meatball the 0 Ranger)':

This is Mizan's test character.
Let's get a few things straight, as someone is being overly emotional and
reacting to bad/wrong/nonexistent information. All i have been hearing
about this morning is Hercules moaning, derived from baseless information.

#1 I had no idea that destroying the command center would have adverse
effects on the guild. Had i known none of us would have done anything bad
towards it. In fact I had no idea that attacking any of the NPC rangers in
Angel Grove sucked down guild energy.

#2 I am building a series of smarter NPCs, and the reason they stumbled into
this castle is because i am plotting waypoints for them across the mud. The
Rangers were not a predetermined target, shh-okay? They are designed to hunt
and kill as much like players as possible, that's all. No guild wars, and I
am not out to destroy your guild.

#3 A few players and wizzes decided to sick various monsters against the
Command Center out of boredom. We noticed it was nearly impossible to kill,
and in fact i had killed it by dispatching a hit_player() call that was a
negative value. Boggle that!

I am not going to name the other people involved. I was the one who killed it
and that's all that needs to be said. Nobody involved had malicious intent.
This is not a guild war, never was, never will be.

So in the end i apologize for causing this mess. The carnage was not
intentional. The swiz Vital has apparently worked to restore the functionality
of the command center for everyone in a prompt fashion in either case.
