                         [help multiple]
-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------   

There is one simple rule, if you have more than one character they
MUST be TOTALLY SEPARATE. Sharing of equipment, money, and anything
else is NOT allowed. If both players are on at the same time one 
will be removed, wizard/god's choice.  Also, having one character
dc'd and another active at the same time is considered multiplaying.

Leaving behind money or objects for a second to pick up or
to pass anything through a third player, pet or monster is not legal
and will be considered multiplaying.

Also, there will be NO character sharing, give-aways, etc.
If this is done the transfered character will be placed on inactive
status until its disposition is decided.
There are many reasons for this:
1> more than one character logged in at a time IS CHEATING
More: (line 21) 
2> it is against good and honest mudding practice.
3> it takes up extra login slots that can be used by others.
4> it takes up extra cpu time that could be used by others.

The honest player should be offended by such behavior.
IN SUMMATION, ONE LOGIN PER PERSON.

In addition, should you know that two or more characters belong
to the same person you may not use that knowledge in game play.
In other words if a person has character A in guild X the actions
done as that character have no bearing on those of his other 
character B, in guild Z. Separation is a two way street.

    You are standing in the Operational Nexus of 02h. Power punches and
  the humming of machines drowns the room, which seemingly extends to an
  infinite expanse. The gleaming, crystalline floors are warm to the touch
  and almost emit a pulsating feeling with you could swear to feeling.
  A spiral staircase on one side of the Nexus leads downstairs to the
  Proving Grounds control area. To the east is the laboratory access
