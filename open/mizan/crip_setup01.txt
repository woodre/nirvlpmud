stay that way indefinitely (ie, they never hatch out the kid, they just
keep going further pregnant for duration of spell ... 11 mos, 12 mos, 17
mos pregnant) would be funny as hell

The note is titled 'bitch(mizan)':

Blah. This should be on the board downstairs. So sue me (Don't get any ideas
Sado ;)

You people who bitch at me because 'this thing ate me without warning', and
'this Borg cube thing suddenly appeared in my castle, analyzed me, and
 zapped me and i lost all my stuff can you give it back plus the 100K
 experience for my mudkids?' better STOP.

Yes, my jello tub castle has a lot of good stuff to help players, and the
monsters are always at their recommended legal limits for reward-carrying,
but all that stuff comes at a price, namely life-threatening hazards.
There are monsters that will eat you and steal your stuff, and the
occasional tornado will suck you up, and the Borg cube likes to zap people,
but HEY, life isnt always nice and peachy. I could be a real prick but NONE
of my hazards affect new players (level 5 and under) and you have to
physically type 'kill tiamat' in order to experience the abject pleasure of
dying repeatedly. I mean, get a CLUE, the monster has 9 heads and carries

no less than 30000 gold coins and weighs about 100000 kilograms so go figure,
it's gonna be a BITCH to kill... *fbog*

The note is titled 'bitch(mizan)':

Blah. This should be on the board downstairs. So sue me (Don't get any ideas
Sado ;)

You people who bitch at me because 'this thing ate me without warning', and
'this Borg cube thing suddenly appeared in my castle, analyzed me, and
 zapped me and i lost all my stuff can you give it back plus the 100K
 experience for my mudkids?' better STOP.

Yes, my jello tub castle has a lot of good stuff to help players, and the
monsters are always at their recommended legal limits for reward-carrying,
but all that stuff comes at a price, namely life-threatening hazards.
There are monsters that will eat you and steal your stuff, and the
occasional tornado will suck you up, and the Borg cube likes to zap people,
but HEY, life isnt always nice and peachy. I could be a real prick but NONE
of my hazards affect new players (level 5 and under) and you have to
physically type 'kill tiamat' in order to experience the abject pleasure of
dying repeatedly. I mean, get a CLUE, the monster has 9 heads and carries

A voice echoes: mizan, level 21 fades into view.
	You are drifting in a ever-changing environment of pure color
  and sounds. Typically, no naturally occuring laws of natural physics
  apply here. Entropy is an sharp understatement.
    There are infinite obvious exits.
A tombstone.
A petrified log.
Ok.

    You are standing in the Operational Nexus of 02h. Power punches and
  the humming of machines drowns the room, which seemingly extends to an
  infinite expanse. The gleaming, crystalline floors are warm to the touch
  and almost emit a pulsating feeling with you could swear to feeling.
  A spiral staircase on one side of the Nexus leads downstairs to the
  Proving Grounds control area. To the east is the laboratory access
  junction.
    There are four obvious exits: out, north, east and down
A giant black mainframe computer.

    You are standing in the northern side of the Operational Nexus.
  There are more machines here, but they are smaller in size, and seem
  to be running much quieter. Unlike other parts of the Nexus, some
  chattering noises which seem to be verbal communications can vaguely
  be heard. It appears to be coming strongest from the west.
    There are three obvious exits: west, east and south

    You stand in a quieter section of the Operational Nexus. Before
  you are a large array of what appear to be power cables and punches.
  Gleaming, hard plastic-like material forms a barrier between you and.
  certain death if you were to touch the exposed connections at the
  termination junctions. Further east is a different part of the Nexus,
  as it seems to be bathed in a soft orange light instead of the crystal
  bright white lamprails that envelope the rest of the area. To the
  north is a sign proclaiming the Ops center for the Monster's Guild.
    There are three obvious exits: west, east and north
A motorcycle battery.
A pile of shit.

    This is a brightly lit area in the Operational Nexus. Devices sit
  here in a neatly packed cluster in the center of the room. Additional
  power punches can be seen in a lineup servicing these devices.
  Yes, all of the equipment used for operating the Monsters' guild
  lives here. You notice that things are very clean around here, despite
  the added activity caused by all the monsters. There is a shimmering
  portal leading down, presumably to the locker rooms of the Monster's
  Guild. In addition, there is a portal north to the staging area of the
  next generation series.
    There are three obvious exits: south, north and down
A network server named (monster-daemon).

    You stand in a quieter section of the Operational Nexus. Before
  you are a large array of what appear to be power cables and punches.
  Gleaming, hard plastic-like material forms a barrier between you and.
  certain death if you were to touch the exposed connections at the
  termination junctions. Further east is a different part of the Nexus,
  as it seems to be bathed in a soft orange light instead of the crystal
  bright white lamprails that envelope the rest of the area. To the
  north is a sign proclaiming the Ops center for the Monster's Guild.
    There are three obvious exits: west, east and north
A motorcycle battery.
A pile of shit.
