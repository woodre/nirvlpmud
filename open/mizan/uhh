Seymour tells you: had a hemroid problem recently...after they gave me something for it, my butt hole swelled up and wouldnt go down so they had to cut it open, remove a couple blood clots and stitch it shut...needless to say it HURTS
Seymour tells you: to make it worse...im afraid to even shit till this is healed up
