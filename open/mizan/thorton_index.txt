1:04 AM 1/10/2004 Captured Wipeout/Thorton character sharing.

This file is the index for three screen captures recorded on Mizan's character.
Feel free to skip to Part IV to get to the conclusion/meat of things.

PART I
thorton_01.txt - This is some background info, the night prior i had snooped
Blob when he found my monster goggles, and using them. It was a weird form of
playtesting, just to see what a players reaction to a disorienting device
such as this is (/players/mizan/mbv2/items/goggles for the curious)

PART II
thorton_02.txt - This covers the following:
- Discovered via a feint that blob == thorton. Read on if bored because its
  kind of funny how i did this. I linked the contents of the file above to
  thorton, based on information he had that only blob could know.
- A wiz discussion about what to do with this character. It was determined 
  that thorton == blob == wipeout. That's the beef of this file.

PART III
thorton_03.txt - The judiciary phase of things. Basically the events of this
file follow immediately at the conclusion of part II.

PART IV
Summary, Thorton was jailed "for a week perhaps", and Wipeout jailed for 
24 hours. If caught again, well, mercy at discretion of a players affairs
wizard. I'll be keeping a watch randomly for the time being.

Thanks for reading,
