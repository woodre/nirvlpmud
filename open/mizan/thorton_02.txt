**Mizan** [1] peek domo long
You express both fear and helpless joy at the sight of Domo-kun.
Fully grown, he is about eight feet tall and basically is a gigantic
block of a short-haired, furry brown monster. His mouth seems permanently
agape, exposing gigantic white teeth. His simple black eyes have an almost
expressionless but attentive gloss to them. His demeanor is that of a
wookie melded with that of a twelve year old child. Don't piss him off.
Despite his fraidy-cat personality when young, he is absolutely ruthless
and overzealous in protecting his friends and fellow guild members.
Domo-kun is in good shape.
Domo-kun has looted 79 corpses today.
You notice that Domo-kun is carrying 34984 coins.
