The note is titled 'Command center destroyed by Wiz!(Hercules the Green Ranger)':

Dear Rangers
Mizan has appearantly decided to mess around with out guild.
he destroyed the command center
only after hours of work,Vital got it back up, but
we had to build everything from scratch!
than mizan launched messive attack with all kinds of mobs on our npc's....
he seems since we worked hard to fortify the place and players cant kill it,that gives him the right to ruin our guild...
Expecting ur replies
Hercules
G ranger
