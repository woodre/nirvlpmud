**Mizan** l
This is the town police station. It consists of a single large room
with benches, desks and other seating locations. One may find the 
village peace keepers here or prisoners locked up in the small bared
cell to the west. The station looks quite old as if it has been in
service for a century or more. The floor is worn as well as the
greeting desk. Everything is kept clean and tidy despite the worn
conditions.
    The only obvious exit is east.
