This is a sample set of rooms that i coded to help a wiz with their castle.
WTF is going on? Well here is the deal:
The main room is 'hydrahome.c'. 
Once you go there, clone up a 'fraidyhydra.c'. This is a stock monster
but it has 5 heads, random move capabilities, and steals heals from players.
It also once in a room that is not compatible (i.e. isnt is_shit_free())
will teleport out back to the start- hydrahome.c

This is useful as a sample for people who want to put randomly moving monsters
in their castles but restrict them to motion. For example crabs and starfish-
crabs can be on the beach and boardwalk, but starfish should stay in the water.
