The note is titled 'All the Idiocy(Telina the Cherry Ranger)':

Personally, I think someone's spandex were washed too many times. It appears they have become to tight to allow proper flow of blood so everytime they log on they can do nothing but whine about this and that. Get over it. If power is low, then get it back up. But to log on, whine for half an hour, then log off.. what are you doing to better it? Nothing, in my opinion.

So the wizzes had fun. Nothing wrong with that. Vital fixed everything and I am sure that its all dropped. But to start up some note.. why? To start a war with polymorphs or something? Please. It was all in fun and it was fixed and it was dropped. Just let it go. If it bothers you so much to log on, that you have to whine everytime, then dont log on. Problem solved.

Just my 2cents,
Telina - The Cherry Ranger
