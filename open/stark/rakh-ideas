disadvantages:
no mud spells.  will still drain sps, but not actually cast :)
can't wear shields, helms block 'rush' spell
wc is dropped to certain levels.  never can wield highest wc.

advantages:
mini guilds still exist.  (felines are encouraged!)
high ac.

training: 1 main mob.  in hunting you have to fight it to 5/10 alone.  (vampire room?)
training will be in the 4 areas.  within each area is at least 3 lines * 5 levels.
you will gain each in an order, broken up over the different lines. (not sure on this)
raising each level will take both exp (which can be fed into gob) and skill proficiency
user must have certain # in hunting and dif # in trainable weapon usage (amt of wields?!)
if user does not use hunting and hunting-trainable-weapon, use can NOT raise that skill


fae raises as a attribute.  not sure on exact costs at this time.  definate curve.
luck can be raised to 30 at a VERY high curve
fae -> fps=100+100*fae
fae<3 can only cast auras per round
fae<6 can only cast auras per fight
each spell uses fps to cast.  auras need fps to maintain.
when fps are 0, user looses control.  all auras dropped. dark fae aura starts and
feeds 5hp/ until death or at least 1fps
