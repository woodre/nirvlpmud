Guild idea!

Rahk
aka: completely destroying the catlike race from the blacksun rising / darkmage trillogy
aka: semi tanking guild
aka: Not_Druid

no dmg spells
can't wear shields
don't 'like' helms... spell dmg?
defense is capped anyways
only trident, polearm, claws, fist weapons can be wielded
after certain glvl, weapons up to wc16 can be wielded, but hurts certain spells?

spells based on auras
healing aura - heals a bit each tick, at higher lvl, dmg -> heal
shielding aura - increases ac of user and later on others (inroom)
damage aura - hurts enemy no matter what, increases in glvl
turning aura - takes dmg from other player or pet(inroom)
reflecting aura - most powerful, takes dmg and reflects a % to enemy

auras are single spells, then per fight, then constant.  based off of fae which will
be a higher stat and harsh to raise.  
will have sps and fps (fae points).  fae points will not be seen.  spells will be able
to be cast, but will fail at their intended jobs.  users may not notice when they fail.
fae is brought by a natural meditation in which sps->fps
meditation is natural 2sps->1fps every 50hb or 2->1 every 10 whilst in meditation.(can't move)

althought defense looks low.  rahks best ability is based on dodging.
I hope to use this much like felds amulet / eurales ring / becks rangers
that occasionally block or just not take dmg
they are not a pure tank class, I plan on having a way so that side damage
is higher or that dmg that should've been taken to rahk could be shifted to 
others in fake-side hits?  I'd need to consult higher ups for this.
in time, rahk become better at taking damage and dodging it properly so this 
dmg to others is lessend.

this is mostly a defense guild.  they should be seen as helpful to have in groups
and alright soloist, but may not find life very easy that way.
should be looked on as unfamiliar and strange since they operate 'outside' of normal
ac constrictions.
