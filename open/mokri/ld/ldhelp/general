Thank you for helping test the new driver! The
new driver will make the MUD faster and more
reliable.

As you know (otherwise we wouldn't need testers!),
not everything here works. If things break, please
let a wizard know. If you know whos code it is that
broke, mail that wizard. If you do not know, mail
Mokri or Fred.

If you have any issues or suggestions dealing with
any commands/objects provided through this tester
object, let Mokri know.
