You can send/receive mail into this sytem by opening a

and logging on with your characters name and password.
Your mailbox through 'mail2' and your mailbox on the

Note that on the website, there are a few characters that
might cause your mail to not send. If it doesnt send, try
removing them (may include / \ ' ?) and resending. Please
keep a log of which characters cause issues and let Mokri
know, so he can take care of it.
