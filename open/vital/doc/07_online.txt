Moving Around the Files

UNIX uses a heirarchical file structure with the root of the tree
being named /.  Other directories branch off from that root directory
and in turn have their own sub-directories.  All directories may
contain directories and files.  Directories and files are referred to
either by their absolute name, which always begins with /, or by their
relative name which gives the file's name relative to a particular
directory. In order to get around in the UNIX files structure, you
have the typical UNIX commands for listing files, your current
directory, etc.


pwd: shows you your current working directory

cd: changes your current working directory.  You may give either 
    relative or absolute path names.  With no arguments, it changes
    to your home directory.

ls: lists all files in the directory named.  If no directory is
    named, it lists the files of the current working directory

rm: deletes the file named

mv: renames the file named

cp: copies the file named

mkdir: makes a new directory

rmdir: deletes a directory.  All files must have been first removed.

more: pages the file named so that the file appears on your screen 
    one page at a time.

cat: shows the whole file to you at once

head: shows you the first several lines of a file

tail: shows you the last several lines of a file

ed: allows you to edit a file using the mud editor

Your directory is /players/<wizardname> which is automatically
aliased by the game as `~'. You can quickly get to your directory
by typing cd ~. All of your files will be in your directory. You 
can also access all the files in the /open directory.
