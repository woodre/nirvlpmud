Give message.  Finish message with '**', or '~q' to cancel
]Hello..
]I just thought I would let you guys know that I had jailed Mortarion.

]]The reason why I did so, was he had asked me to 'play mule' for him, 
]meaning hold something that Khrell has and give it to Mortarion who
]is his other character... I did at that time tell him that it was illegal
]and I could not do it for him.  
]
]So he logs out Mortarion, and logs Khrell in and pulls an Ancient Ninja Katana
]out of his locker, goes to the lance road and drops it off, logs out and
]logs back in Mortarion and picks it up.  All that after I told him he couldn't
]do it because it's illegal.
]
]Before I jailed him I let him know that I was forced to jail him because what
]he had just did was illegal, his reply was that everyone does it.  but then 
]just said fine.  And that was the end of it.
]
]If you have any questions, please let me know.

]]Thank you,
]Katya.

                         [help multiple]
-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------   

There is one simple rule, if you have more than one character they
MUST be TOTALLY SEPARATE. Sharing of equipment, money, and anything
else is NOT allowed. If both players are on at the same time one 
will be removed, wizard/god's choice.  Also, having one character
dc'd and another active at the same time is considered multiplaying.

Leaving behind money or objects for a second to pick up or
to pass anything through a third player, pet or monster is not legal
and will be considered multiplaying.

Also, there will be NO character sharing, give-aways, etc.
If this is done the transfered character will be placed on inactive
status until its disposition is decided.
There are many reasons for this:
1> more than one character logged in at a time IS CHEATING
More: (line 21) 
2> it is against good and honest mudding practice.
3> it takes up extra login slots that can be used by others.
4> it takes up extra cpu time that could be used by others.

The honest player should be offended by such behavior.
IN SUMMATION, ONE LOGIN PER PERSON.

In addition, should you know that two or more characters belong
to the same person you may not use that knowledge in game play.
In other words if a person has character A in guild X the actions
