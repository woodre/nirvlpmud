wiz/unixcmds/_rm.c can be yanked, it's in /bin/wiz now
wiz/unixcmds can be rmdir'd after that
figure out if wiz/jobs/jobs.c is being used at all, or move it
here
all stuff in wiz_soul/ can be moved to /bin/wiz/secure/
but check each one individually
there are files in /bin/wiz/ that inherit them so the inherits will
have to be moved over
