On later years, it has become more and more complicated to adventure and
gather experience. This book was written to be a guide for adventurers.

As everyone knows, the meaning of life is to gain experience and raise
your level and skills. This can be done at specific places. To train your
fighter skills you must find the arena. Thief skills must be trained at the
head-quarters of the secret thieves guild hidden somewhere under the city.
Mages must seek the wisdom of their teachers - the Archmages - to gain more
power, while Clerics must find divine teachings from the gods within the
temples.

The best way to get experience is to exterminate bad monsters that stroll
about the cities and other realms that can be reached through the mages
time travelling devices. 

Your reputation will depend on how kind you are to players, both new and
old. High level players, who are popular, and have a large following, can
build their own forts, temples, keeps, and towers, and look over the lands
that they once fought to keep safe.

The altogether top goal is to survive, and become rich and famous. Some
players who reach considerably high levels may also ask to become a 
creator, the highest honour that can be granted within this world.

Note: As this is a glorified version of real life, you better get drunk
if you are hurt. Then, you will heal faster. Never trust privacy. Wizards
have eyes everywhere, which they use to study usage of their domains etc.
