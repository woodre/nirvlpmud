messages "illarion** Re:   healersCc: feyth,mythago,charmDate: Jul  5 23:21From what I can tell, it was never intended for healers to be able to get solo combat experience.  However, if they are in a party with at least one other member, including a mudkid, they can get experience, albeit at a vastly reduced rate.  I am honestly not sure how to handle this.  Mythos might even have done that on purpose, just to reward cleverness.  I would welcome suggestions. **"
