He traveled to learn and reposit knowledgefor further use- not to better himself physically. Thatwould come later.Balyn stumbled through a mysterious portal into a swirlingvortex. Around all sides of him he saw Nature in its purestessence- fields of snowflakes and animated snowmen, thedeserts of the burning sandstorm, the beaches of the arctic.He approached the mountain first, spiraling high abovethe clouds past an old wizard and an odd octopus of ice.At the apex of the dark mountain, his eyes fell upon adark snowbeast- some kind of Guardian demon that seemedto protect a portal. Upon further investigation, it seemedas though the Guardian was nothing more than a creaturewho hadn't the slightest aggression in its heart. Withthis in mind, Balyn strided through the portal to seewhat other creatures he could embrace and learn about.Balyn stepped through the icy portal to be greeted withthe talons of the Guardian's brother- a fellow demon ofice. The cold-blue claws ripped and tore through Balyn'sflesh until he was forced to flee.Unfortunately, Balyn fled north, directly into the waitingmaw of a snow demon. Plagued with excruciating pain andwithout any equipment to protect him in his battle, theyoung adventurer plunged further into the cavern, not knowingthat this was his real mistake.The depth of the caverns led to a powerful Ogre Mage,gripped in its clutches the legendary SoulEater, a weaponof mysterious power. Flanking the magi were two more ofthe infernal snowbeasts. It was the only glimpse Balyn wasafforded of his surroundings before his body was completelytorn apart and pillaged by the triumvirate of death.Escape impossible, Balyn acquiesced to his fate and diedthe death of a warrior at the hands of his enemies.The Church of Nirvana greeted him with a church prayeray have temporarilylost his wealth, but Balyn never forgot the lesson he learnedthat day- in the unknown, power is necessary to adventure.**"
