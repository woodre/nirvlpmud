These days when someone gets GC it's not level based..  it's a list in the intrument room and you go there and type gc_me to get the powers.  I'm guessing you still have them from back when you got level 9..  *8)  I have no objection to you being a GC of course, I just wanted to double check since I couldn't remember if you still did.  If you still have them, and want them, let me know and I'll add you to that list, as well as to the lore gc file.  Star **"
