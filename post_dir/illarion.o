What bothers me  most is that it sort of forces people to be regular players or else. I feel a lot of people will choose to just go.    There has to be a more simple way of doing this besides a centralized system.  fixing the amount of coins in the system can cause a problem because other  goods, resources, etc in the game aren't fixed.   Rather than trying to create some complex system that doesn't break down  because money is fixed while goods aren't why not attempt a simple  system that keeps money from being created faster than other goods.   that's what I have for now.  **sparrow** Re:   Economy ProposalCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,vital,star,illarion,mizan,cloud, rumplemint, hardlyDate: Feb  2 10:47Woooo some discussion on the matter. SYPER difficult to implement. With the suggestions that I made goods are considered money. I might not have made that clear, when something would need to be cloned to the npc, it would have to be paid for out of the same pot as add_money. Yes it would be a total nightmare to implement. I would have to track down every item, re-value them all so that there is some sort of uniformity. Then locate every shop in the game, tie them into the economy. Standardize all of the heals.... yes headache. It would be a beautiful thing when complete, but that's the only way I could forsee a true economy.  Now I don't think I'm super clear on what you are asking, would you care to eloborate? Right now money is a minor inconvienence at most, and I do not understand what you mean by forcing people look look doh sorry about that to be regular players? It doesn't really force anything as far as I can see except an attempt to standardize values, costs, and give incentives for coining in different areas. Sparrow **boltar** Re:   Economy ProposalCc: (To: sparrow)  vertebraker,fred,vital,star,illarion,mizan,cloud, rumplemintzDate: Feb  2 21:23 With inflation it is the same manipulation as in real world fiat money.  Controlled inflation irl is designed to steal the value of people's savings forcing them into constant economic activity while also stealling the productivity gains of current work over yesterday's work.   Thus if a player isn't on frequently to keep up, he may login and  find he no longer has the funds to be viable and then simply decide  he doesn't want to put in the effort to rebuild. **sparrow** Re:   Economy ProposalCc: (To: boltar)  vertebraker,fred,vital,star,illarion,mizan,cloud, rumplemintzDate: Feb  2 21:28I know it is a long read but I offered two ways to deal  with players that are inactive for a long time. One, we nickel and dime them to death, not the biggest fan of that. The second way is we take their money back into the economy, if they happen to show back up, it is returned to them. It is possible that this would cause a shortage or negative.  Even so, it would work iteself out quickly and if it didnt, that's what the global offset is for. You just being a negative nancy Bolts, I'm trying to figure out what you want here. i don't care what we do.

I'm on from time to time and I will try to be on a lot more now that I'm out of the hospital so if you have questions mudmail me and I'll do what I can to help. **chip**Subj: Mud reunion on Sunday Feb 17, 2013Cc: (To: boltar) fred,sparrow,mizan,rumplemintz,illarion,x,vertebraker,angelDate: Feb 10 12:15Shinshi has set up on facebook, a sort of reunion for all the Nirvanites we can get ahold of, both new and old, on Sunday, February 17th, 2013. On top of those whom he invited, I've invited close to 30 people myself, and hopefully they have more people they can invite as well. In light of this, and knowing I don't have that kind of access, we would like to request a couple of things from the administration, in hopes it will help bring life back to the mud. The first of those requests, is a significant increase, or even maybe removal, of the limit on the number of players that can be in a party. If even half of the people invited make it, there will be 15+ people on at one time, many of whom we can surely say would love to socially group together, definitely with more than 5 to a group. Or, as an alternative (I'm not sure how hard it would be to do by comparison), maybe make it so you can link groups together. Like, form 2 5-person parties, and link them so the channel and experience gains are linked between the groups. Without the social aspect of the mud, it won't go very far in the way of trying to bring it back from the dead, and this sort of thing would help incredibly. The other request is in regards to the alignment killing restriction of Power Rangers. Even if it's just for the reunion day, we would like to request this restriction be lifted, as I know for a fact several of the attendees will be playing their Ranger characters. With this restriction lifted, even if it is just for a day, it will help as far as not limiting where and what these groups (or hopefully, one really big group! lol) can go after. Rangers are generally limited to barely more than half of the mud's npcs, and this would take much of the fun from the reunion day's attentees, knowing they only have a small amount of stuff to do, then waiting for respawns and such. Lastly, this is more of a personal request, if there's anyone you all know, that we were unable to get ahold of to let know this reunion is happening, please take a moment to pass along word of the event, its date, and if they haven't been around since the address changed, the new one of course! Many thanks for the time and help in this from you all. This will hopefully be a day to remember of Nirvana's already colorful history! Hope to see you all there! Sincerely, Chip **boltar** Re:   Mud reunion on Sunday Feb 17, 2013Cc: (To: chip) fred,sparrow,mizan,rumplemintz,illarion,x,vertebraker,angelDate: Feb 11 09:08Paragraphs please.

I don't plan to log the entire incident, since it was very long, but I will summarize, then put the personal attacks in a log.  Worm complained about people who don't play the game, messing it up.  He referenced the town guards, and stated they are controlled by the good guilds, against the evil ones, and that no one cares about balance anymore.  He said they used to only attack people who engaged in PK in town, and never anywhere else. I explained to him that as far as I know they were put back exactly as they were, and Symbio agreed.  I said they will attack anyone who actively engaged in PK.  He said he hadn't attacked anyone, but I did note that he is on the knight's criminal list, and said that could be why.  He then stated that knights are therefore allowed to control the guards, making town a safe place only for knights, rangers, and bards. I told him a knight or ranger who engages in PK would be attacked, and that any bard who is a criminal would be as well.  Around that time is when he got personal.  I'm going to put it in /players/star/worm_issue.txt I do realize I talked to him, which could mean someone would say I "started" it.  But I was actually trying to answer his questions and concerns about why he was being attacked.  Star **worm**Subj: guardsDate: Feb  1 02:03and before bitching openly, i griped to Gemini AFTER i had tried to come to post and gripe to you directly via mail.. but was attacked by guards etc.  just sayin **dragnar**Subj: ChannelsCc: rumplemintzDate: Feb  1 13:08Hey Illarion, Rump and I are working on creating a channel daemon. The only thing we have left is getting the feelings in /bin/soul to work.
