I also can play a little during the day on Saturdays too since she works on Saturdays. During the week I have to get up at 5:50 AM to prepare for my commute to work so I can't really play on weeknight evenings. I do log in for a minute or two (literally just a minute or two) some weeknight evenings. If you haven't sent me coins there yet then please don't, hon. Since this is my first time through the game with a character I want to get the feel for how things work even if I'm struggling a little at first. I really appreciate the thought and may change that tune soon enough, though. I look forward to partying with you soon.  *HUGS* **wtknight**Subj: Hi HonDate: Oct  5 18:54Hi there,   I'm really sorry I brought up World of Warcraft then I've been gone.  I thought I was going to have more time to play than I  do.  Friday nights the gf and I eat and watch TV after work then when she heads up to bed I usually go too because I've been up since 6. Saturdays I watch college football most of the day and just zone out. I really thought I'd be more motivated to go down into the basement and play late at night. In the near future I think I'm going to be switching jobs so I'll probably be getting up at 8 instead of 6. I do want to play with you sometime if you're still on WoW when I get around to playing more.   I've missed role-playing with you :). Be well, milady.  White Knight **devin**Subj: Howdy from an old friendDate: Aug 27 06:56Hi!!
