Shinshi said something bout how he was maxed guild and no real guild exp.  So I looked into it.  Abk told me that he maxed guild by fighting a whole lot, and wouldn't confess to anything else as far as a guild bug that allowed it or what.  Max is 20mil for the guild. he's been in guild like 2 days yet he doesn't list on the Top Exp Board for 2009 at all even though the bottom is at 5m.  If you gained 20mil in two days you should be on there.  After that I checked some other logs and then booted him out and removed his guild status.  tail /log/ADD_XP if you want to check it out.  I guess adding 31m to your char is the same as fighting a whole lot. Whatever.  Just letting you know.  Fred **krylos**Subj: neo battle won was not given neo objectCc: (To: boltar) fred,chip,mizan,shinshi,aingeal,illarion,mosobp,angel,starDate: Jan 14 01:12on jan 14 just after midnight or maybe slightly before i went into battle with my symbiote for the neo test.  i won that fight and was not given my neo guild object.  2 people were witnesses to my accomplishment so if ther is nothing on  record you can ask genesis and quagmire.  i am asking to be given what i earned thank you very much.  you all pretty know who my alts are so if you see me on please send me a tell and i will switch characters so you can make any corrections **shinshi**Subj: bitchDate: Jan  5 19:04bitch **sparrow** Re:   rewiz?Cc: boltar,fred,x,vertebraker,illarionDate: Jan  8 14:05I'm fine with the idea just as long as you realize that there isn't  much help available. I'm on from time to time and I will try to be on a lot more now that I'm out of the hospital so if you have questions mudmail me and I'll do what I can to help. **x**Subj: Ok, let's get started.Cc: (To: sparrow) chip,fred,angelDate: Jan 12 03:55Ok guys. Let me know what you need help with and I'll be here. I work a lot of OT and my schedule changes, but I go in M-F at 2:30 pm.  I work til at least 11.  So I'm most available during the day.  I'm not sure where to start. I would like to get some ideas on what projects to tackle. **sparrow** Re:   Ok, let's get started.Cc: (To: x) chip,fred,angelDate: Jan 12 10:18Illarion has some good prelim work done on adding skill trees to the mud. I've also written something about trying to fix the economy, but that is a huge undertaking. Id like to see the skills get done. I'll be on again in a cpl hours to talk more about it. -S **sparrow** Re:   Ok, let's get started.Cc: (To: x) chip,fred,angelDate: Jan 12 13:47oh and I'll believe it when I see it ;) listen to your voicemail sometime **boltar** Re:   Mud reunion on Sunday Feb 17, 2013Cc: fred,sparrow,mizan,rumplemintz,illarion,x,vertebraker,angelDate: Feb 11 09:08Paragraphs please. I am having difficulty parsing that.   as to login limits, they are what they are presently. I can't recompile  the present driver. intent was to just switch to a newer driver  and then well everything dried up.   **rumplemintz** Re:   Mud reunion on Sunday Feb 17, 2013Cc: (To: boltar) chip,fred,sparrow,mizan,rumplemintz,illarion,x,vertebraker,angelDate: Feb 11 13:24I believe the login limit is 40 - I can work on a way to recompile the driver, but I'm not guaranteeing I'll have it ready by Sunday.  As for the party restriction, i can look at that - main thing is to get the shares and xp thing right, I don't think the limit of 5 had anything to do with anything.  The ranger alignment lift will have to be thought about hard, it's there for a reason so we'll need to discuss that  Rump **boltar** Re:   Mud reunion on Sunday Feb 17, 2013Cc: (To: rumplemintz) chip,fred,sparrow,mizan,rumplemintz,illarion,x,vertebraker,angelDate: Feb 12 09:33the old driver has fits with the upgrade miz did some time ago.  I doubt it can be done on such short notice.   The party limits and such were what seemed right at the time.  The ranger align limit I think should stay. taking out key parts of the game  play like that probably won't work out so well.  **shinshi**Subj: RoguesDate: Mar 14 17:00I'm going to have you working on some KICK ass descriptions for the Rogue hall. Rob will be working on damage messages. That will be all. **shinshi**Subj: what spells left to doCc: (To: shinshi) chip,wicketDate: Apr  8 17:32guild kick guild max_out hall messages help files double check every spell for pvp sp loss on every spell GUILD REVIEW **worm**Subj: DnD Neverwinter NightsDate: Jun  5 22:04its in beta, free, kinda neat.. didn't know if you'd like it just though i'd let ya know **worm**Subj: ignore thatDate: Jul  8 01:54i hate it already.. but, it is free.. lol i've started making items for games.. fear the steam workshop and all of its potential **carnage**Subj: Neo'sDate: May 26 15:19Since we have control of our symbiotes now, i think we should be able to control them enough to be able to use our wocket pets.  Just my opinion. Later, and if you u see this Happy Birthday tomorrow, atleast it is tomorrow when I sent it Carnage **"
