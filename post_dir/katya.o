Nothing really severe or red-flaggish, aside from the radio controlled helicopters, used Ferrari 308, several hundred pounds of caviar, and this "Ducati Desmodromic" whatever the hell the thing is.  But call me, i need some resolution before granting the line of credit.  Oh yeah, the guild thing is clear so you're free to rejoin. But we really need to discuss finances and stuff. **slacker**Subj: ohhh...Date: Jul 17 22:30Jen did seem overly friendly:)   ok.. **deagan**Subj: DOH!Date: Jul 18 01:00Sorry, hon.

I will be handling the wizard expectations, etc stuff more.   my idea is to better match people with what they want to do. As I told wax, managing wizards is like herding cats. :)   **worm**Subj: heheDate: Sep  1 15:26well i'm glad, that means if you were ever here.. more for me!!! so ha. ;) and i eat sushi too. how nasty is that? ;) sorry to here about the puke.. but it happens.  29 eh? thats the perfect age for me! be mine! :P **redrum**Subj: gmailDate: Sep  5 11:59she also has access to the gmail acct. dont know why she wanted the add from you. to check up on me maybe. **redrum**Subj: hahaDate: Sep  6 09:42yeah, she's pretty jealous. you can still mail me there. just wanted you to know so you didnt send something risque  ) **redrum**Subj: pervDate: Sep  7 12:45you know you are...vixen :P **vertebraker** Re:   me.Date: Sep  7 23:10It's not a threat.
