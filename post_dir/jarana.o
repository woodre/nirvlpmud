I noticed a typo in the statue description though, "of" is spelled "ob."  I also noticed that Justin's statue is a cloned Magus statue with a different short.  Exa statue was pretty funny actually.To understand what I want for my mob, you need to visualize that he stands in the fires working at the anvil.  You can enter the fires and then he asks you questions--generally trivia regarding Nirvana geography.  7 questions, 3 easy (how many armor slots are there?), 3 moderate (who can you find above fudo?) and hard (what is the name of the tower that will take you home in the Ways?).  There will be a larger set of questions for each category so it isn't the same every time (i.e. the mob will pick 3 easy questions from a set of 10, etc.).Getting ALL the questions correct will put out the fires and you can fight Stone, who will fight similar to Steel with more hps and a special vs. criminals.  If you get any single question incorrect, the fires remain and the fight vs. Stone is much much more difficult.  It would be nice to limit the number of times per boot you can attempt the questions to avoid abuse.  If there was some way of me to add questions to the set, that would be great to keep things interesting.set_marble Beautiful white marble, polished to a reflective shine.set_forge A massive forge made from iron and marble dominates the room.  Its fires blaze brightly, forcing you to shield your eyes.set_fires Shedding intense heat, the fires burn in the heart of the forge relentlessly.set_anvil The fires prevent you from noticing any detail from where you stand.set_racks Sturdy oak shelves that hold various armors and weapons.set_weapons Many weapons adorn the racks.  Although the majority are blades, there are a few hammers and maces as well.set_armors Heavy platemail and shield forged from the finest steels.**larisa**Subj: lockersDate: Sep 16 01:06Lockers are located up, east from the community room. I'll see what I can do regarding the storage, too. I requested the Templar rooms for that reason, so if other guilds have more available already, we may be able to have an increase in storage in one or the other.  Larisa **saynt**Subj: ClanDate: May 23 12:48I've got a clan of my own and you're welcome to join, it's Elites only, and so far it's just me in it. Let me know if you're interested next time we're both on. Have a good one man. Pz. Saynt **"
