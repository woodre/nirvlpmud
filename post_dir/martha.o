I still want to help you if you need it and offer any suggestions and support that you may need. If I'm not on and/or you are having trouble getting ahold of me, feel free to give me an email at kename@gmail.com and I'll get right back to you.  Hope that helps some. Vital **vital**Subj: martha promoCc: (To: vertebraker) x,fred,fakir,martha,boltar,forbinDate: Aug 13 14:06I promo'd martha to 40. She's coming along nicely, and I think being able to look at known examples will help her get a grasp on what she'd like to implement better.  If she screws up, feel free to bust her chops, kill pet poodle, and generally make her feel miserable for doing so. I will too.  thanks, little v **vital** Re:   are you back>Date: May 27 16:35Sure. vital.nirvana@gmail.com and let me know if there is anything you need. vital **devin**Subj: helloDate: Aug 27 06:58Hi - I'm not sure if you remember me. We played here many years ago (my rl name is JOhn Fontaine) and we went to RIT together. If you get this and what to chat, my email address is johnjfontaine@yahoo.com Seeya, John **"
