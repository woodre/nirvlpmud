She's reposting this every few hours on her wall, and getting a lot of people commenting that they're worried for her safety, and people who say they'll be on the lookout, and that they unfriended and blocked you..  etc.  I'm not sure if this can or will get you into trouble, but she has pretty much accused you of a crime and has posted for all to see that you have more than one account..       STALKER ALERT! A so called friend is stalking me and now my       facebook friends as well! His name is Bill Stacey and he now       is stalking me with another account under the name of Jason       Hall (from Missouri). If he has befriended you please defriend       and block him ASAP!!!! Thank you  Kat **star**Subj: Your questions about monsCc: OzzyDate: Dec 19 15:46Umm..  yeah..  Your questions about mobs I meant.  Anyway, Dragnar says Doran has killed his chars enough times for him to know personally that he can kill in just one round.  As for the Deathmaster, he has a WC of 210, which maybe I shouldn't tell you, but this way you know for a fact that he is nasty.  When Dragnar said that over the wiz line, everyone said some version of the word "ouch:..  He is NASTY! He also does multi cast spells.  I would assume that if you got unlucky enough to be nailed by a good hard hit, then a few spells in a row, you might be dead before you can blink.  On the other hand, it's worth over a million exp..  If you wanna try him again..  rofl Apparently it's also invisible, and easy to stumble upon.  And Fred says it does not like to cuddle.  Why on earth you'd want to try to kill it, I just don't know..  But there's your answer on the two mobs.  They're icky, very strong, and actually capable of nailing someone in a heartbeat.  I would never code such a thing..  laff  Star **dragnar**Subj: betaDate: Apr 30 16:35I added you to the list, just go up from the senior adv guild. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: Prestige SkillsCc: (To: krash) deathseeker,titan,thomasDate: May 14 10:54I have given all of you the HP Bonus for prestige.
