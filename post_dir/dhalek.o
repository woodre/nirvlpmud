Sorry, I got involved on WOW a while, was burntout on here, I'm pretty much back in full swing, hopefully you logon and check this.  I have plenty of projects, right now, or you can do the quest thing, lemme know what you're interested in, hopefully things are going well for you. -dave  From: earwax Subj: Nirvy reward point stuffs  Cc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,mokri,pavlik,fakir,sparrow,angel,khrell,brittany,tristian, rumplemintz,linus,yumcha,mosobp,stardream,martha Date: Aug 21 07:09  I've finally redone my writeup, after having lost the file somehow and throwing away my hand-written notes.  In any case, it's in /players/earwax/NRP_writeup.txt It's a fairly long file, so anyone that would rather read it in email mail me your addy and I'll send it to you, or you can just ftp it from here.  This is a project that really needs additional ideas, at least for the rewards, and a great deal of code and tweaking to be done.  I'll welcome all help, but at least send me input on it.  -wax  **"
