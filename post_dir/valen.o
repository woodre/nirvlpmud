Well, I'm somewhat available after 5pm EST, til maybe 10 pm M-F. Sat and Sun i can try to show up if you're around ; )   I don't know if you're getting a feel for this place but it can be a trifle overwhelming. Let me know if I can help. Feel free to email me questions to tem164@gmail.com, I check that daily.   **angel**Subj: item_fix.txtDate: Aug 22 23:44item_fix.txt   this is ur first file to fix. sorry have been busy so I did items first. get that done and any questions just get with me                  Angel!! **angel**Subj: belt changeDate: Sep  6 18:19hey    I changed the special in ur belt clone it and test it. see if u like the change it just made sense to make the change.                  ANGEL!  :) **angel**Subj: mobsDate: Sep  6 20:52ok,  I went through mobs belt and key  they are all good as they currently are. Don't change any of it at this point unless u ask me. Also, know once code is in game wizes are not to change it with out approval of a 100+ unless there is a bug or type then you would also need to wlog it.  prior line should say typo not type...       Angel  :) **angel**Subj: castleDate: Sep  7 00:26hey,     Good news......... you had so few correction in ur rooms I just changed them. it was not worth a file. a couple spelling correction and room length corrections. It is ready for the game. It is time to edit ur castle file. when were both on get with me...     Angel!   nice job!... **angel**Subj: ApprovedDate: Sep  7 01:16It is done. Ur castle will come online after the next boot. I changed up ur castle.c so it will actually open. look at it. you can change the name, desc, and how   the players will enter.           Angel! **mizan**Subj: Delorean griefing on channels, and stuff.Cc: (To: boltar) illarion,rumplemintz,aingeal,khrell,star,x,pain,tristian,keeper,artos,valen,angel,worm,shinshi,sparrow,forbin,guestDate: Sep  8 21:17Hi guys, I heard about some of the stuff Delorean was spewing on channels, and wanted just to give my take on things. I don't really care about what he does or says, and I have encouraged other wizzes not to provoke him by even responding to anything he has to say. Yes. That is my official stance. Just flat out ignore him no matter how irritating his words may be. Don't bother him, don't help him, don't hinder him, just ignore him completely. But let him speak.  I know it sounds counter-intuitive but I encourage you to do the same, and even spread the word about it to others if possible. Delorean may be a griefer and a selfish little twit, but he has a right to login to this game and play.  In the past I have not been as saintly and approachable either, and I recognize that. In the past I have done things like delete his characters or siteban him and it has not changed his behavior. When I returned to here a few months ago,  I made an offer to start off with him on a clean slate. I believe I have held my end of the bargain. However he has chosen not to. But I'm cool with that.  Rather than wipe him off the MUD i chose a different vent for dealing with him. I made a comic which features some of his antics, of which there are two episodes so far visible at:  http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/a-barycentric-griefing-motion/ and http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/the-third-fastest-thing-in-the-world/  Again, I encourage others to simply ignore him, and let peace and contentedness be in your soul rather than pure rage that (insertDeityHere) has forsaken us and left us such a miserable little shitfucker to suffer with. Delorean and his kind are a vital part of this MUD's ecosystem, as we need diversity... strong PK'ers, roleplayers, socialites, coders, whining douchebags- We need them all.  There is a saying in Arabic which does not translate well, but I'll try- "I let my enemies dine at my doorstep because it is my pleasure, God willing." So paraphrased my take on that is: "I let Delorean play here and speak what he wants because it is my pleasure."  So you know what to do. The next stupid thing he does, mudmail me a transcript and I will credit you appropriately on my next comic strip(s).  Thank you for reading. -Miz **jeanyus**Subj: travellerDate: Feb 14 22:38Hey I'd love to explore your area a little more, could you leave some information with the old traveller west of adventure guild if you are every bored and wanted something to do. I'd appreciate it and I'm sure any future adventurer's might too.  **guardian**Subj: heinous-samuraiCc: (To: vertebraker) valenDate: Feb 21 20:01I dont believe it is fair for someone to own a postion that controls guild when that person uses personal feelings towards a player to prevent them from joining a guild.  I have made level 15 and heinous will still not let me join cause he doesnt like me.  he is trying to say he doesnt feel like i would make a good canidate for sams.  if that is how he is going to command samurai guild he needs to be removed from emperor postion and give it to someone else `** **mizan** Re:   port policyCc: mizanDate: Apr 20 10:01I don't know anything about fmud, but this policy port you speak of smacks a lot like something Adobe has implemented for Flash authentication. In any event, that requires a policy server to be enabled on TCP port 843 of the server in question. I have setup a quick and dirty policy server on that port- please let me know if it works. Therefore on your side, the client will probably need 'nirvana.beanos.com:843' for its specification Please let me know if this works. What I have setup is temporary and needs a little bit of work to make permanent.  Thanks, -m **worm**Subj: FB FrenzyCc: (To: mizan) illarion,vertebraker,sparrow,shinshi,fred,angel,valen,boltarDate: May  8 01:30Artos is all excited over the FB and Fmud stuff.. he has Lyric all ready to write up some really nice stuff to help explain things to new players, etc etc.. and honestly, the potential is really there to pull in some new people.. IF DONE RIGHT. We cant let this kid  ... whatever his damn name is, be the one doing it.. he sucks balls. Even if someone enjoyed mudding, if they saw his shit.. they'd laugh and leave. I think this has a better chance of really working than trying to get ranked up high enough on that mudsite to get noticed. Someone with a brain makes it, it looks nice.. Nirv players link it  to thier FB's, recommend it to friends, the Fmud is in place.. tada. So.. really awesome potential, but I vote we make Illarion do it. Tell that kid thanks for his idea, its been improved and he can join the new one. :)  Oh.. and Ill, np on the recommend. Always lookin out for a brotha. :P **sparrow** Re:   FB FrenzyCc: (To: worm) mizan,illarion,vertebraker,sparrow,shinshi,fred,angel,valen,boltarDate: May 11 00:34I took it as, allow the kid to create a Nirvana FB Fan page. We've already spoken about taking 'official' completely out out the equation. I was the one that mentioned Fmud. I was checking it out a few years back when FB was still something that humored me. Yes nirvana probably does need an official Facebook page, no I am not going to do it. I would be more worried about having people logged in to give new players direction before worrying about something like that.  I dont know, I just got out of jail, I'm rambling. -S **valen**Subj: codingCc: (To: dragnar) valenDate: Oct 15 17:34I'm a bit rusty since I last coded here in LPMUD lib.  If you know somewhere I could find a website that helps with coding with LPmud lib, then I would apprecaite it. I did so some searches and came up books to buy. But no thanks.  I think mizan did a forums area for us wizards on the beanos website. But I don't recall the URL path.  Valen valen **dragnar**Subj: rCc: **Date: Oct 15 19:01I sent you an email let me know if you get it... If you have ideas and you want pointers on how to move forward let me know! **"
