They were partying when Blackstar hands me a vial of nitro. When I complained to Justin, a knight I thought who record this crime, I was told that it was no big issue since I was only a newbie on this mud. After I complained to him some more he offered to get my experience back, but that was not the point as I see it. To me his actions defend Blackstars instead of condemning. I thought knights were supposed to protect and have honor, not participating in crimes like these or partying with repeat offenders such as Blackstar. I have always looked up to the knights as defenders of truth and justice but apparently I have been in error cause not all knights are good.Imp - a disillusioned newbie who doesnt want to be a templar knight anymore.**larisa**Subj: WarningCc: larisaDate: Jul  1 23:13This is your official warning.

It was fun and I had enough expto make 170 hps now so I'm better at fighting like a newbie now!!! I am raising my stealth so the Magequrd won't know I am there next time.  When I am higher level I am going to go kick the Mage qurdto death then kick its corpse.  Sorry Ididn't come back in...my computer system crashedand I never could get it to reboot till I coulduse my startup disk. The party with you wasthe most good luck I had all night last night!!!Thanks!Likrish**wtknight**Subj: Goodbye KnightsCc: (To: daredevil) wtknight,akasha,jebuly,budah,boltar,fakir,panther,bannock,jareel,pndrgn,airk,alexander,alucard,alycia,amani,antonio,aries,avengelyne,beez,blkbear,borith,braveheart,bristan,brondar,byte,cavalier,celina,chiele,colette,croft,danimal,dawn,delete,dianne,dove,dreadwolf,fawn,fele,fisherking,fred,gino,handy,heather,heavena,hellspawn,huma,jayjay,jello,jerich,justin,kandle,kat,katrin,khrell,kinsler,kitiara,kurgon,lacar,leia,macer,mermaid,morphious,mysery,naomi,nisanity,odysseus,pantera,pegasas,perrin,primal,proserpine,psi,rhesa,rumba,set,shelly,silverwolf,slacker,sly,dragnar,solanis,squid,starblade,steve,stypend,tally,tarklyn,tartis,teiannia,terra,tessisu,thor,tony,trask,trent,tristan,truth,tyschire,vanyel,vedder,wendell,whitedawn,willow,windmaster,wyll,xanadu,wtknightDate: Dec 16 03:58Dear Knights,  Tonight I left the guild I used to love and I'd like a chance toexplain to you why I left your fold.  Last night I logged in andfound out that Fele was going to be booted from our guild over hispretitle.  I have known Fele for years as a Knight and I've neverseen him cause any problems. He has always been a pleasant comradeand I'm proud to have served by his side among your ranks.  Hetold the Knights logged on that he didn't want to be removed fromour guild when we pressed him for details.  After he logged offthe Knights got into a discussion about Fele being booted and weagreed that we liked him and didn't want to lose him as a brother.Torin was logged in and he thought that Fele deserved to be bootedfrom our guild.  The rest of us disagreed and I believe the word"dissent" was brought up.  It seems that when a knight's opinionis expressed it can be labled "dissent" by Torin if he disagrees with you. I log in tonight (wednesday night late) and find out thatFele has been booted from the guild.  I notice Torin is on the guildline spouting off about dissent and other such nonsense again andthat he has now written a note to justify Fele's removal and to warnother Knights against dissent.  The knights that are logged in aren'thappy with Fele's removal and they are expressing their opinions abouttheir brother being removed from their fold.  Torin eventually warnsus about dissent and says "this is going to stop".  I ask him if he'sthreatening people for expressing their opinions and I say that I willcontinue to express my opinion on the private Knights forum when itcomes to issues involving the Knights. (please note this is not verbatim. Although, I am trying to paraphrase the events as clearly asI can from memory.) It eventually came down to Torin suspending my powerswhen I told him that his threats don't scare me.  I said I wouldcontinue to express my opinions and he took my powers. This also tookmy ability to speak on the guild line.  That was the final straw for me.I won't let a petty tyrant think they hold some power over me by holdingmy guild powers hostage. I then proceeded to write a goodbye note on theguild board and quit the guild.  Then I told Torin my opinion of himon the star channel since I no longer had the knights line and hesaid that I had made an "enemy".  A few minutes later, I went to thevillage green and told him on the star channel that his unarmed, guildless"enemy" was there.  Torin shows up with Spiral and he proceeds to attackme.  I go into the church and they show up in there and we flap back andforth.  A little while later, I'm in Fakir's room with Akasha and Torinand Spiral abuse the tt command to jump to Akasha and they both attackme there.  I'm very disappointed in the direction the Knights are headed.I'm mostly concerned with the leadership of the guild. I realize thatmost Knights are good decent people.  And I will never attack a knightexcept for Torin and Spiral who are honorless in my opinion.  It's a sad day in the Knight's when someone loses their powers for stating theiropinion. It's a sad day in the Knights guild when people are told "Youdidn't code this guild and you have no say in how it is run." That wasValor that added that last little tidbit.  I didn't code the guild but I'vebeen in the guild longer than most. I was in it the first night it openedand I have been a supporter of the guild since that night.  I was glad thatBoltar offered the Paladins a similar haven in so short a time period andI've always been happy with the Knight powers. Very recently, I've noticedan influx of power hungry, blood thirsty Knights entering our fold andthis disturbs me almost as much as petty tyrants wielding petty powers.It is one thing to kill an evil in the name of justice, it's another thingto use the Knights guild as an excuse to murder people, be they evil or not.My main complaints have always been about people abusing powers over otherplayers.  Communist China and Cuba violate the human rights of anyonethat dares to speak out against their governments. That is how a powerful,morally corrupt power stays in power. Personally, what I'd like to see isthe knights left in the guild to leave the guild in droves if conditions stayas they are.  I think this would be a good form of protest.  But if you arehappy with the Knights guild then don't consider leaving.  Many of you are friends and I will miss fighting by your sides but I can'tcontinue as a Knight with the current power structure that is in place.Sincerely,White Knight**maledicta**Subj: xp refundCc: feldegast,fakirDate: Sep  5 23:03We will be restoring your xp lost due to the fact thatyour crime was set during a spar, which should nothave happened. 317861155 was the total.                     Maledicta**maledicta**Subj: Judge AdvocateCc: (To: larisa) justinDate: Sep  9 00:44Ok, use judgetitle to get your new title at the tablet.

My first area I'm going to make will be the town of Havre de Grace, including the heights, state park, schools (minus bakerfield), most of rt 40, the downtown area and the waterside. I'd like to get ideas and input from all of you who would be interested in bringing our beloved HdG onto Nirvana and make it the best area it can possibly be. I've got a majority of it mapped out on paper as a reference for directions and order of streets and businesses. But there's still alot to do as far as detail and setting it up to be coded. All ideas and suggestions will be taken into serious consideration, and many I'm pretty sure will get used. For all those who actively participate in this hometown pride even as I like to call it, I'll have a plaque or something of the sort set up in one of the main areas of it with the names listed of all those who help bring it together. I want it to be the best it can be, as I'm sure all of you do too. Mail me anything you think of, or email it to me at nyteshade187@hotmail.com / message it to me at http://www.myspace.com/lostminddeusesmuerte, or IM me at knockmyselfout82. And as I will be taking this project very seriously, only serious suggestions will be considered. Hope to hear things back from you guys (and girl lol). Best wishes. **chip** Re:   Good IdaCc: (To: jaz) james,justinDate: Jan 17 15:03I've kinda put the whole thing on hold as i've no internet at home and can rarely, if ever, log on. i hope before long i can come back to the mud full time and put HdG together in full. i'm still making notes of all idea on the side though, as well as saving emails and mudmails of ideas from all us HdG raised mudders. good to hear back from you, W. hope to talk to ya soon Thanks, Chip **"
