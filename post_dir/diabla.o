Please be patient.  Also if you have any good ideas, feel free to let me know.  Also if you think you may have more appropo room descriptions, that are NOT too wordy feel free to let me know, and i'll reasonably consider if it is within the flavor of the guild.  I am trying to color up some of the dreary standard colors in the room shorts if they don't already exist.  -Khrell **"
