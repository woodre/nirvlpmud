Histravels took him from the forgotten village ofPratho, to the lands of the demons, to thefuturistic city of Derellia IV, to the turtlefolkof the south, to the Space Station, and to afar away desert plain called "Quantos".It was in Quantos where Erdric discovered thedark forces which once controlled Nirvana.The forces whispered to him through hisdreams, terrifying him and driving him nearto madness.  Despite his prayers to his God,the dark forces overwhelmed him, tellinghim of Shardak's inevitable return, ofthe undead forces massed within the darkforests, of the forgotten vampiric sword,and other such terrors.Erdric could not escape the forces, andthey poisoned his mind.  They fed from Erdric'sstrength, leaving him weak and siphoned ofall earthly strength.  Amazing powerraged through all of Erdric's body, and itbecame food for evil, and his soul becameinhabited by things that we may never know.Erdric fell from Good, and he becameJacoby, the Dark Lord.Having become one with the dark,Jacoby created fourteen medallions from thedark metal adamantite, from deep within theDwarven Tunnels of the south.  He imbuedwithin these medallions a great,dark power.  He held one of these medallionsaloft before he was banished foreverby the forces of Good, and it was lost.But thirteen remained...**khrell**Subj: addy and infoDate: Sep 30 18:42John S.

People get logged because they have been persistant problems and for no other reason this has always  been the case. This is where assium comes into play, as it is their  accusations that people believe, not the dull reality that one has to  be like worm or otherwise make himself to be a significant problem.  2) cheating. Basically your note says to allow cheating. How is that fair  to the people that don't cheat? That we either have to allow cheaters  to do as they please or loose the cheaters and any non-cheating friends they may have. If this is now the way games need to be to survive, I will shut down. Because a game that allows cheating will soon not have any  players anymore either, because cheating will make it too easy.  **mizan** Re:   mud issuesCc: aingeal,stardream,boltar,khrell,mizanDate: Dec 18 16:56I just want to make clear that i am taking the constructive criticism from Stardream to heart. However i would like to point out a few things... First off is that so long as my snoop objects were autoloading, i was snooping myself. I figured it was the least i could do to add a check and balance to the system. Eating my own dogfood, so to speak.  Secondly, that the sheer majority of cheating that has been observed is of a small group of repeat offenders. I think it is very rare indeed when a newbie/stranger comes on here and performs deliberate cheating.  That having been said, i shut down all snooping. I'm not even going to log people like worm (entreri@elysium) because quite frankly, he has nothing interesting to say/threaten about here anyhow.  Also i realize that for the greater good of the mud things need to change, but this whole issue about privacy being sacred is just in my opinion overblown. We would be fooling ourselves if we wanted to spread the message that this place is a safe, viable chat alternative. Raw telnet packets going over the air unencrypted- it would simply be irresponsible of us to promote that as a safe system to communicate with others. Now i realize that most IM protocols are also wide open. But i also realize that trying to spread a message to players that this is a safe place where wizzes will not just randomly snoop people for their amusement- I am totally in agreement with that part. 100 percent. So long as we are aware of the differences in these two issues i think things will be okay. Well, that's all i have to say for now, and that managing some of the perceptions to players (while i may not agree with the basis of many of them) is important, and i'm willing to adapt along.  Thanks for your time, -miz **vertebraker**Subj: zodiacDate: Oct  3 13:57People born in the Year of the Horse are popular. They are cheerful, skillful with money, and perceptive, although they sometimes talk too much. The are wise, talented, good with their hands, and sometimes have a weakness for members of the opposite sex. They are impatient and hot-blooded about everything except their daily work. They like entertainment and large crowds. They are very independent and rarely listen to advice. They are most compatible with Tigers, Dogs, and Sheep.  that's you. **vertebraker**Subj: zodiacDate: Oct  3 13:58People born in the Year of the Pig are chivalrous and gallant.

They don't make many friends but they make them for life, and anyone having a Boar Year friend is fortunate for they are extremely loyal. They don't talk much but have a great thirst for knowledge. They study a great deal and are generally well informed. Boar people are quick tempered, yet they hate arguments and quarreling. They are kind to their loved ones. No matter how bad problems seem to be, Boar people try to work them out, honestly if sometimes impulsively.

As far as being a wiz, I had finished the expansion on my area and was just going to ftp it and have wax approve it or tell me what needed to be changed, balanced and I cant Ftp so I was  just going to drop it.  There are things I did as a wiz character I  shouldn't have.  I admit that and I did not get pissed about it when I had levels removed from me.  I far from abuse any bugs as a player actually as far as bugs go as a player I really don't know any, I know how to kill stuff using judo against a mob, using their own strength against them or using abilities that I can get from the game to the fullest advantage, in no way  do I find crazy bugs and abuse them.

Instead, they can provide special  abilities, protection values outside of ac, damage specials, etc -armor to be classified by its weight/ac ratio with the following categories:  Body Armor:    Categorization           AC  Weight    clothing/nonprotective -  0    1    light                  -  1    2    medium                 - 2-3  2-6    heavy                  - 4-6  4-8   Shields:    nonprotective          -  NA   NA    light                  -   1   1    medium                 -  2-3  2-3    heavy                  -  3-4  3-6   Head/Arms/Hands/Legs/Boots:    nonprotective          -   0   1    light                  -   1   1    medium                 -  1-2  2    heavy                  -  2-3 2-3 **earwax**Subj: Worn gear proposal part 2Cc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,fakir,forbin,stardream,pavlikDate: Mar 29 02:28 -Max ac items will not carry specials except in extreme circumstances, which  should fit the following criteria: rarity (no more than 1/3 chance of being  cloned), extremely dangerous mob, probably in a PK area, and being limited in  some manner as to levels or who can wear it. -Legacy gear will be automatically adjusted, due to absence of a flag to be  set in future armors, to appropriate weight based on the ac, type, and if it  has a special or not. -Armor will set a restriction level in living.c, which guilds can query, so   they can set appropriate penalties for using heavier gear than they allow. -The range of carry capacity will be adjusted - lower chars having far more  capacity than they currently have.  Strength will account for much, but a   total noob (level 1, str 10) will be able to carry reasonable gear. -The accessory items will have 0 ac in ALL cases.  Specific adjustments can be  made for special items like the e-gear, etc.  In those cases, it will be   magical protection, meaning based on specials and dtype (physical allowed)  protections.  AC will mean armor class though, and nothing that isn't armor  will have Ac. -We should implement better item statting.  I'm 100% in favor of allowing   players to have full stats (minus special information) on gear.  See below. -Randomization to some extent of gear stats.  In other words, something that  grants 10% magical protection should actually grant 5% +- random(5).  This  will make the best stuff more unique, and in combination with allowing the  players full statistical knowledge, will help us create an actual economy. -An auction system.  Taking advantage of the above steps, combined with the  forced diversity that this system will foster - between guild reqs, armor  restriction/encumbrance levels/randomness/knowledge - will foster major   progress in moving toward a cap-less and full economy. -Gear-induced stat modifiers.  This will go more hand-in-hand with possible  future races and stat changes.  Not as important right now, but it should be  kept in mind. -Narrower range of item values.  Shit worth 200k is foolish. **scarr**Subj: Hey it's me darc.Date: Mar 29 11:38Hey can you add this char to my list please.

Anyways as players gain a level they gain perhaps 5 attrib points to distribute as they wish, perhaps a random stat will raise automatically each level.  Max for each stat will be 30, to conform with current standards; each race however, will have different maxes for each stat, with 30 being the ceiling.  Stats will be more in control of a char's power than level, but they gain stats through levels and xlevels.  Currently I don't have anything planned for gaining stats in any way other than level, although that may change.  strength:     damage bonuses in combat, carry capacity dexterity:    chance to hit in combat, dodge, parry, skills etc constitution: hp, hpr (regen rate), endurance points, epr willpower:    innate resistances, willpower type checks, has an effect on ep mental:       sp/spr, int/wis checks  racial, static stats: they either don't change, or aren't controlled by char: luck:      they can 'roll' this stat at char generation charisma:  also roll this at char generation, within limits set by race size:      this will go up as they level, until they reach their max size            also a rolled stat  Specifics:  HP: 10* con + 2*level + 2*xlevel      7  con at level 1  means 72  max hp - higher than now     30 con at level 19 means 338 max hp - about equivalent to now  SP: 10* men + 3*level + 3*xlevel      7  men at level 1  = 73      30 men at level 19 = 357   EP: 7*con + 3*wil + 2*level + 2*xlevel  HPR: racial modifier + con hp regen per minute, max of 60 SPR: racial modifier + men sp regen per minute EPR: racial modifier + 2/3 con + 1/3 wil  current stat checks will be routed to the most appropriate stat  Implementation: these won't go fully into the game for general players until this stuff has been thoroughly tested and races, gear changes, skills are ready to go in as well, but they will be the first in for testing. **earwax**Subj: initial race guidelinesCc: (To: vertebraker) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 19 08:30Race Guidelines  Players have the following attributes:  Strength Constitution Dexterity Willpower Intelligence  They have the following racial attributes: Luck Charisma Size  They also have the following racial modifiers to their regen rates: Racial HPR Racial SPR Racial EPR  When creating a race you should consider as a starting point 120 total attrib points for the main 5, with luck and charisma being 20.  No stat should be above 35, and never should a race have 2 stats at 35.  If charisma or luck are raised or lowered you should subtract/add half that amount to the base  attribute pool.  When putting points into stat maxes, you should consider the following:  35: Extremely high 30: Very high 25: High 20: Normal 15: Low 10: Very Low 5:  Extremely low  Racial regeneration rates should be thematic for the race, and stats should be balanced accordingly.  In other words, if you grant high regeneration rates to a race, the overall stats should be lower.  Another aspect to consider is innate resistance levels to dtypes, special  abilities, nightvision, innate disadvantages, etc.  Everything that goes into a race should be considered balance-wise versus the other races.  Ideally, we will have no one dominant race.  Every player can decide whether they would rather have innate resistances, high stats, high regen rates, or whatever.  Also keep in mind that this is purely an initial 'guess' as to how races  should be balanced.  Once we have figured out some races a better system can be devised. **earwax** Re:   changesCc: (To: fakir) vertebraker,vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 21 06:44I'm sorry to leave this unanswered for so long, but I wanted to make sure I could put a comprehensive reply together.  This is stuff I've had floating  around in my head for quite a while, so I want to make sure I respond as  clearly as possible.  For starters:  Nirvana is a dying MUD.  I don't know that anyone wants to hear or accept this, but it's a fact.  If you look at Nirvy over the last what,  four, six, eight, ten years, it's steadily losing playerbase.  One or two  fewer players average per night, per year, perhaps, but it's dying.  What's  happing is we're not attracting or retaining new players, and gradually the  older players develop real-lives, or are kicked in the ass by their RLs.  They don't return, and we're not gaining new players at the same rate we lose them. This is a slow attrition, but it's a fact of life.  This is the reason, plain and simple for trying to introduce any changes all - to reverse this.  Now, the older players are going to leave - in my own case, I've burnt out at times, and the eight or nine years I was gone from here were due to real-life. I'm a returned player, and yes, this happens fairly often.  It doesn't happen often enough to compensate for the loss of players.  In any case, there's no mud in existance that doesn't lose players - to the MMORPGs like WoW and Everquest, or whatever, to girlfriends, wives, kids, prison (heh), the USMC, or military service in general, rl in general, or whatever.  This is a fact  of life for any MUD.  The key is to replace those players with new ones.  This is an ancient MUD.  I actually enjoy working on this MUD for that reason. I'll bitch and moan and gripe as much as anybody else about things that don't work like they should, if at all, and the pain in the ass it is to change  anything, but I've had a long history here, and the administration and pbase has as well.  This is something you can't replace, period.  The problem is that it's ancient in its systems.  Combat is clunky and obsolete, the chars  all use the same gear, there's no individuality, and syntax here is simply incomprehensible to most.  I am, usual flap aside, an extremely competant  player, and recently I've brought over one of the best players from another MUD, and he's had the same thoughts that I did learning this game:  it's  simply too piecemeal, the syntax isn't consistent enough, it's too simple in some areas (player creation, lack of races, etc) and too ridiculously complex in others: clunkiness of the save system, the weird exceptions for attribs,  hell, who thinks to type 'help attribs' - the inferior help file system, etc. **earwax** Re:   changesCc: (To: fakir) vertebraker,vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 21 06:47I've been thinking over these issues for years, and as most players and  developers here are aware, I've been gaining input on one topic or another almost continuously during my time.

What the problems boil down to is the following:   Poor noob interface:  they are clueless, they don't gain appreciably in     power, they don't know what makes them more powerful - levels, stats,      etc, they don't understand the game.  Noob areas are all over the place,     some of them aren't truly noob areas, noobs can't carry even minor gear,      syntax is a nightmare, and we don't have a really professional or modern     looking interface, in general.   We're very limited.  Combat is ridiculously repetitive.  It's too      simplistic, the only things to consider are healing and making sure to use     your one spell per round.  There's no variance, it's just different guilds     with different commands.  Use aliases, it's all the same guild.  I know     this sounds harsh, and some of you might argue, but the fact is, that's      what it all boils down to.  If you really want to argue the point, send me     a tell or mail.   Every player basically the same.  There's very little variance in the high     end gear or chars.  They all max all stats eventually, they all use the     same gear when they can get it, etc.   Guilds make no sense.  Why does my bcm have no differences in combat than a     knight other than emotes?  A knight should be physically-oriented, the     mage more magical.  There's entire essays to be written about this subject     but I'm cutting it off here.   Saved items:  this is terrible.  Most chars can't even store their base     slots - of which there are too many, admittedly.  My bcm can store most     but not all of the gear - ALL OF WHICH - he equips generally.  It's also     very confusing and difficult to grasp for new chars, and primitive by the     standards of most modern, high player-base muds.   Gear makes no sense.  It's obvious what's the best - the lightest, max ac     item that has the best specials.  If you don't see the problem with this,      then you don't need to be reading this at all, stick to playing the game.   Pk pointless: there's actually a lot to be written on this, but the core      issues are being addressed by verte and me, and there's a large-scale     project going on by pain, jenny, me, other wizards for that as well.   Misc issues: not going into them here, but there's a lot heh :)  This leaves the solutions and the reasons for them as the next topic.  What  I'm trying to do first is to streamline the attributes - we currently have 10 that some of which do things, some don't, some depend, nobody knows.  What's the tradeoff between spending exp on levels or stats or guild?  Those are too difficult of questions for noobs to be considering.  Let's streamline this and let them know exactly what each stat is responsible for, let's make them go up each level, so they can focus on tradeoffs between guild levels and spending exp on levels.  **earwax** Re:   changesCc: (To: fakir) vertebraker,vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 21 06:47Next topic is races:  every player is currently the same.  This is boring,  it's foolish for balance, and irritating for players and guilds.  Let's put in some true graces, some true differences, let players choose and customize  their chars on a fundamental level.  Skills.  This is one of my major goals.  The skill system I'm working on implementing is the single-most addictive system I've ever seen.  It's similar to the old warrior guild, but it's even more intuitive.  It makes sense, it facilitates things for guilds, and makes guildless chars viable.  My main  interest is addicting new players - when they see their skills shooting up  from the first fight they are in, and continuing to raise, it gives them a sense of accomplishment.  This is important for retaining noobs.  Gear.  This is essential for everything else, and it's going to be unpopular initially, but it's a simple necessity for guilds and skills.  The last topic is the problems.  My single biggest debate with myself on this is, does this change the fundamental nature of Nirvana.  Well, what I've  finally come to decide is that yes, it does, and no, it's not a bad thing.   Like I said, Nirvana is dying.  One can deny this or refuse it, or close their eyes to it, but the fact is Nirvana is declining.  Something needs to be done, and that something is modernization.  My goal plain and simple is to increase the playerbase.  The ways to do this are to simplify the mud's syntax, make it's core commands more professional in appearance, enhance the help files,  make learning the mud more intuitive, and most importantly, ADDICT them.  In any case, I'm sorry this runs so long, I've actually tried to keep it as brief as possible.  If there's a subject anyone wants elaboration on, I'll be happily to provide it, but I'd ask that they talk to players, talk to newbies, look at the game as a newbie, remember what it was like when you were a newbie and just look at this with an open mind.   *  **earwax** Re:   changesCc: (To: fakir) vertebraker,vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 21 06:52To answer the question from an implementation standpoint: I'm doing this piecemeal, just a bit here, a bit there, and I've  been talking to players more or less nonstop on this.  I have an  open invitation for them to 'beta' these changes, and I'm making an extreme effort to keep them in the loop.  From a code end, well, it's a pain in the ass, plain and simple. I'm going to have everything legacy supported of course - that's  what makes this a pain in the ass.  I'd actually now rather do this stuff this way rather than on an alt mud, simply because they can see the progress, and it's less to learn for any given player.    It will be less of a shock this way, it will be gradual, and most of the players will pretty much know what's going on, plus for  every 'nerfing' that happens, it can be balanced with a positive.  Anyways, I'm handling the code-end, and I can elaborate on exactly what I'm doing if you're really that interested. **earwax**Subj: blahDate: Apr 24 22:43From: vertebraker Subj: idk  Date: Apr 24 21:06  i don't want to be an admin here anymore.  i don't really want to code here anymore either.  you flipping out and yelling at me, telling me to do my job...  i guess i don't see the point of "doing my job" when i was doing  my job by NOT rewizzing khrell, who is worthless, arrogant,  and a complete nutcase. i don't want to be part of a mud  that's that desperate, same as i am sick of getting shit from you  for not doing what "i am supposed to be". you're bossy as fuck  so you should be the leader, not me.  i'd rather do nothing or do something. i don't want to be bound  by your opinion. nor do i really like all your ideas. i think they're  going to make the mud bland. they sound like every idea ever derived  from a mud or rpg ever.   [1 - 59 h l d r ra x q b ?] (current: 59) r **earwax**Subj: blah2Date: Apr 24 22:43Return to get ' Re:   idk' Subject:  You have entered the text editor.

If you happen to make any important deciscions, it would be nice if it were logged so that someone can verify things.  Symbio did explain to me the it was 'pre-approved', but in lieu of any hard proof of said approval - I decided to stick to the rules and asked him to have Amiro log off.  He will argue symantics about the fact that I didn't ask Amiro himself to log off, but I was snooping him and he did tell Amiro I wanted him to log off.  After asking him nicely a few times to have him log off, I put my foot down and jailed them both.  He (Symbio) then proceeded to talk rather nasty to me using characters as Fobinisgay and Forbitch.  It seems that my lowly level 300 doesn't stand a chance against the mighty 5000.  Anyway, I don't have a problem with Symbio at all, though I suppose he has a problem with me now.  In the future, using workreports would be nice.

He's been causing nothing but issues, I've personally seen him flapping and instigating and antagonizing over and over,  he's had a long history of this crap.  I sat him down before and gave him a very explicit warning.  In no uncertain terms I informed him that if there was a future problem with him I would take action, at the very least, resulting in his removal from the guild.  Then I come to find out, between talking to Salina, Squint, and Mosh, and reading the log that Salina conveniently had, that he's getting stupid again. Further, recently he was flapping at other chars while I was on, including myself.  I didn't take action at the time, figured bah,  whatever, this is minor stuff.  Then I read the logs for knights and see him criminaling mosh multiple times, see him lying in at least one instance in the criminal logs, from a few months ago, and see him giving himself awards as well.

If anything, all that did was speed communication to bring it to Earwax's attention. Otherwise he would have taken the same action, and I probably would have done the same.

Instead of being a leader, you decided to be a rogue or whatever. It doesn't really matter. Anyway, you can talk to Earwax if you don't like the decision or bring it up to Boltar, although he's likely just to agree with us considering there is tangible evidence that myself and others have already reviewed.

Reptile ignored my warning and attacked sephiroth and stole the loot from his kill after I told him not to have any contact, so I gave him a warning to no longer have ANY contact with him, including pk, b/c i'm tired of reptile harassing people, people regularly complain about him and his characters and as far as I'm concerned, if he chooses to ignore me again then he can sit in jail for a long time, he always pushes the limit when wizards tell him what he can and can't do, always works the system much like vahiti, and I'm tired of it, so yes, I will jail him if he attacks sephiroth, but as I told him, he can kill whoever he wants outside of that. so, as I said, you shouldn't listen to retards he's just a fuckin whiner, and worm sits there and defends him  for no apparent reason other than that he wants 'unrestricted pk' which is fine, except when people are harassing others on a regular basis on channels, stealing their loot and kills, and killing their kids and pets so if there's a problem with my decision let me know, but I feel its fair me  **vertebraker** Re:   no, don't listen to retardsDate: May  6 16:42Banning someone from PKing another person is going over the top. Obviously we'll have to revise the rules on kill stealing and so forth, but PK is not harrassment. One can easily avoid this by either NOT setting a PK flag, or staying OUT of a PK area. Unlike kill stealing, from which a player has no defense, or the more blurry mudkid killing, which a player COULD have a defense, if they chose to (not using the kid while in PK ... er, rather not using the kid at ALL), PK is easily avoidable. Therefore it is not harrassment. Just as people sending tells to other people is not harrassment. That is why we have the "tellblock" command. Eventually we will have more mechanisms to combat harrassment, such as gags or PK-flags on mudkids.

If you want to keep your wizard get involved with this.  It's seriously the most important project in the last 15 years.  -david (dhalek@comcast.net) **fakir**Subj: dewizzingCc: (To: boltar) francesco,pavlik,stardream,jenny,pain,zeus,wocket,feldegast,vital,jaraxle,eurale,khrell,pestilence,puppy,star,wren,angel,martha,gemini,jamila,catt,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,aquila,kain,lacar,brittany,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,airwoman,catacomb,veehsan,haji,hair,skie,chip,sampson,vertebraker,xDate: Oct  7 19:16I guess you know what your doing with an ego enlarged, self indulgent, puffed up with power wizard like Earwax in charge of the mud. If you wish to know what I am talking about, read some of the mails he has sent me.  Personally, I like the mud the way it is. I don't want to change it. I have no intention of dancing to some tune Earwax feels like playing on his flute. I do not, nor never have abused wizard powers. I occasionally snoop a player, but never when two players are in a room or chatting. And, I usually (almost always) tell a player if and when I am snooping them and also when I turn snoop off.  Its absurd that Earwax even brings that into a conversation about being a wizard.   Personally Boltar, I am sick and tired of his heavy handed way of dealing with things...and it's my opinion you are going to have a dead mud very soon because of it.  I will not tolerate someone who threatens, cajoles, and is otherwise a dick.   It is true I do not contribute to the mud much, other than the areas I did code and are in play.  However, I have never seen my contribution here to be one of code.  Wizards come and go...power hungry, unstable wizards have come and gone.  In almost every case where there has been an abuse of power, or a lack of good judgement, I have had a hand in resolving that issue...in some way or another.  And, I might add, you have usually backed me up in most of the disputes I have had some involvement in.  I don't really care what Earwax does. I do not have the juice, nor the time, nor really the interest anymore to try and corral his over-bloated ego...I suspect that issue, if its dealt with, will have to rest with you. apply sphere to being a wizard here...I've had a good run. I have enjoyed the game, and enjoyed for the most part the people I have met here.  If the current gestapo Earwax does indeed have his way and dewizes me, so be it.  Even though he feels otherwise, I still think I contribute something to the game...but as always, I will leave that up to you to decide. I am way too old and way to long in the tooth here to care much what some bully wizard dictates to me as being 'his way or the highway'.  Do you really want someone like this in charge of things to the point you give him THAT much authority?  Vert NEVER had an ego like Earwax. He NEVER abused any wizard power. He never, once he became a wizard, cheated the game. I cannot say the same for Earwax.  There is a WORLD of difference between Vertebraker and Earwax as far as Admin goes.  Personally, if Earwax is in charge, I don't want to be a wizard here. * **fakir**Subj: dewizzingCc: (To: earwax) boltar,vertebraker,fred,illarion,francesco,forbin,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Oct  7 19:33You do what you wish...or rather...whatever B lets you get away with.  Personally, I'd bump you back to a level more fitting of your mental capacity and temperament, but unfortunately, we don't have wizards in the negative level category.  If you continue to travel the path you are currently walking, you will have a very dead mud.  I can almost guarantee it.  Further, I don't give a SHIT what you think, want, or do.  I lost all respect for you as a wizard when I caught you cheating with triggers.  You should have been de-wizzed then, and you should not be a wizard in charge of diddly shit now.  You have neither the skill nor ability to manage people...your ego is far to large a barrier for you to even see over, let alone allow you to manage others in a civil and appropriate manner.  Someday, when you grow up, and really learn what real life is all about, you will look back on this letter and chuckle.  I will no doubt be long gone by then, however.  Have a good life, and good luck riding herd over the bunch of twelve year old players your going to foster here...its right up your alley. f **chip** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 04:07really? you don't snoop players chatting? then it's so funny how you knew the things my templar said to Earwax about a matter dealing with your templar who was on at the time, you drunk egotistical worthless fucking jackass. I think wax's ideas are going to be a huge improvement for the mud and will bring a much larger Pbase. only people who may find him a dick are the abusers/grievers/cheaters. so which category shall you place yourself in? take a pick, heh. no one needs to hear your whining when you're never even around to give any of it solid structure. find something better to do than bitch about things you're not even getting yourself involved in. if you don't like how things are, don't bitch. change em. which means come here more regularly. i've not found thing one wrong with the projects Earwax has proposed and begun. and i'm quite sure in my own mind, being a long time player myself, that this mud needs an admin like Earwax to weed out the weak and the whining. and if you're so heartbroken that the  mud will be doing so well here in the very near future just because you won't be involved to get recognition for it, then maybe you should be dewizzed. i personally will not be expecting recognition, for i'm not able to be involved due to heavy hitting life circumstances. tho, I'm not bitching either, because the place i have called home for over 10 years will continue to be home and a nice one at that. i just wish we could get more wizzes like Wax, Verte, Bolts and Fred around here. and as soon as humanly possible, i'm hoping to learn tons from all 4, Wax especially. Chip - Apprentice Developer (learning) **earwax** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) boltar,vertebraker,fred,illarion,francesco,forbin,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Oct  8 06:24Let's see.  Whatever I'm allowed to get away with.  Personally I'd rather not make decisions, I'd rather just code, that's what I'm good at and what I enjoy.  Babysitting a bunch of grown adults does nothing but irritate me and make me less productive.  I like to figure out  problems and code solutions to them.  This is my enjoyment, and it's the surrogate challenge for me, since the game is simply too easy as a player.  Now, the shit with the triggers, you yourself said and know that it wasn't like it was beneficial to me.  I was dealing with  exhaustion pure and simple.  But that's beside the point, I did what I did, but it still pales in comparison to your own abuses.  I made a mistake, you made repeated mistakes, and more than that, you haven't done anything positive for the game in years, and you have worked hard to be negative.  You bitch, but offer no solutions nor put forth any work.  The work I've done in one single object alone is more than your sum total of code in this game, ever, not to mention the simple fact that it's years beyond your comprehension or POTENTIAL level of  improvement.    If we want to get into specifics, I've done my best, other wizards have as well, to get you involved with improvements in the game.  Instead,  you're content with a slow death over the years, a slow reduction in playerbase each year, until this mud dies, whereas I'm doing everything I can to get as much influence from players and wizards to come up with solutions.  Not only that but I'm putting out thousands of lines of code, working with every wizard I can to teach them and tutor them, improve their skills, and encourage them, whereas you're most happy when you can sit on star and just talk shit about people as a playerchar.  I'm responding here, in this way, because you forced this.  The bottom line is that you spend your time on as a wizard griping and using the snoop command.  I spend mine coding and teaching others and encouraging others and administrating.  This is not even an implication, it's  simple fact.  The logs, the inherits and bug logs and everything else and every wizard on here, pretty much, speak for this, without me having to, yet you want to have a pissing contest.  How about this, put up, shut up, and have a positive impact other than resting on a single, minor area, you did however many years ago, with no positive impact since, instead of trying to put down my efforts.  Ego?  You're real funny, since you aren't even a competant builder, talking about someone that is a highly competant coder, that is doing their best to incorporate the ideas of everyone playing and coding for the game, especially where you just gripe and offer no solutions or work.  When you actually make a contribution open your mouth.  But that isn't going to happen, so just shut the fuck up.  -Earwax/David Halek **boltar** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: chip) zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 13:37  All,   If you have something to say, say it to me.

I take responsibility for not being socially  good enough myself to keep a peace and get people to work good enough  together. but the fact remains that unless we complete some serious  rennovations the mud will just slide into obscurity.   Since there is no one else to do it. All conflicts between wizards  will be resolved by me. Odds are everyone involved will hate my solutions so I advise living and let live as much as possible and don't do things that you know are going to result in conflict or displine or even questionable if you're seen/caught doing them.   I need productive people right now, not squabbles. Everyone needs to add something positive. I can't have people that just exist to cause conflict because they find it entertaining to do so. I don't need people getting pissed off at every little thing. What the mud needs, what I need for the mud are productive people.  It's that simple. And before there is any more squabbling, ask yourself where you(individuals) are on that, and that is the squabbling going to  lead to anything positive or just piss people off so we get even more  short handed?   I'll leave it at that.   -Bp  **earwax**Subj: Nirvy reward point stuffsCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,mokri,pavlik,fakir,sparrow,angel,khrell,brittany,tristian,rumplemintz,linus,yumcha,mosobp,stardream,marthaDate: Aug 21 07:09I've finally redone my writeup, after having lost the file somehow and throwing away my hand-written notes.
