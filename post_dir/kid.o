If either of you 2 feel that you will not be around more often, i suggest that we move our leadership around.  You 2 know me fairly well, so you know that i am saying this with the interest of the guild in mind.  Hopefully i can catch you guys for a couple mins to chat. PeacePike - The Enforcer**pike**Subj: Tenchu HonorCc: (To: puppy) kid,misoDate: Apr 25 19:21Tenchu lost all his honor due to wielding a non guild weapon, i didnt find a help file that explained that, and it wasnt in the laws, so i restored his honor to somewhere near where it was.  If this is wrong dishonor me, or take his honor away, but in this situation i feel like i did the right thing.  Pike - The Enforcer**valerie**Subj: ReturnCc: (To: doodle) kyllur,demonic,shadowstone,symbio,wolfbane,shadowstorm,kid,hogath,konya,chett,wakaluk,miso,war,tenchuDate: Oct 24 14:06I hope very soon to make at least a partial return to action. Though I have not my own internet access anymore, I will be using a friend's computer when I can to come on and play once in a while. I miss you guys I'm mailing now especially, and I cannot wait to see you all again. Be well, and prosper. Val **"
