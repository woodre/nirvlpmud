messages "earwax**Subj: hotel room bugDate: Mar 13 08:21Lemme know when you and I are both on, and I'll take a look... because of how hotel is setup I'd rather see it from your room itself, so I can trace it a lot easier (it's not STRICTLY necessary, but it would save me some headaches).  Sorry about the inconvenience, and thanks for the report, btw.    -ew  doh, I'm invis a lot, so just send me a tell if you're on, and if  I'm around I'll answer it...I stay on and invis while I'm afk for work or whatever, so don't be frustrated if I don't respond right away :( **"
