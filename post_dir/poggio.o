Chett is not a personal friend of mine, but he is a fellow guildmate and due to my position as a sensei, I told him I would talk to the heiarchy as well as to you mizan to get his suspension reviewed.I asked chett if he would accept re-instatement at the price of a significant reduction to his right now cognizant honor, as well as a type of probation where my fellow senseis and the guild leaders could actively monitor wether or not he was following the Way in a proper manner, and he said that these would be acceptable terms. At the very least I would like all of your thoughts as to his case... To speak a few words in his defense, I have pked beside him and he is a good pker, at least to the point of putting out a noticeable effort.I look forward in hearing from all of you regarding this matter, thanks for taking the time in advance.With the utmost respect,Sunim**"
