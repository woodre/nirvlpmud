If you see things in the logs that look illegal, such as giving players coins etc. keep in mind the logs between LD/LP are shared. Check with me before you punish someone. Sami/Krillgeta/Yen and all of their alts are helping me test the guilds on LD. Thanks, -Gnar **rumplemintz**Subj: ElementalistsDate: Mar 10 11:26Have Wicket create a description for the help files  help elementalists  and then change help guilds to list him  **dragnar**Subj: MonkeyCc: samiDate: Mar 25 15:02How does Monkey have mag stat of 50?

It was deemed that as of the new law's posting (Sat Mar 28 16:23:38 2015): "Each ranked Cyberninja (those listed in the guild Ladder) must login at least once a month (a rolling 30 day period). Those who fail to do so will lose their position. A post on the guild boards can warrant an extended leave."  This would allow for absense until 4/27/15. As he has not logged in since then, he is valid for dismissal.  Thanks, - Recca, Directive of CyberNetica. **ashcampbell**Subj: Ele rainstorm bugCc: (To: wicket) shinshiDate: May 29 13:46Autosaving character... Saving Elemental Stats. Save Complete. Autosaving character... ab You return from being afk. You trace a symbol of the Element of Air on the ground.... You begin focusing on Aeolos.... You start to flow smoothly with the winds.... As you perform an ancient kata, you start to focus your Air abilities. You feel a surge of power rush through your veins. ->> eb You trace a symbol of the Element of Earth on the ground.... You begin focusing on Aatami.... You start to earth rumble under your feet.... As you perform an ancient kata you start to focus your Earth abilities. You feel a surge of power rush through your veins. ->> fb You trace a symbol of the Element of Fire on the ground.... You begin focusing on Adroushan.... You start to flow smoothly with the dancing flames.... As you perform an ancient kata you start to focus your Fire abilities. You feel a surge of power rush through your veins. ->> wb  You trace a symbol of the Element of Water on the ground.... You begin focusing on Glyndwr.... You start to flow smoothly with the ripples of water.... As you perform an ancient kata you start to focus your Water abilities. You feel a surge of power rush through your veins. ->> rs Glyndwr says: You are already blessed with my rainstorm! ->> rs Glyndwr says: You are already blessed with my rainstorm! ->> rs Glyndwr says: You are already blessed with my rainstorm! ->> rs Glyndwr says: You are already blessed with my rainstorm! ->> register Registered.... ->> save Saving character... Ok. ->> polish You are already on channel Elementalist. You clean and polish your orb as it shines like new... ->> rs Glyndwr says: You are already blessed with my rainstorm! ->> **symbio**Subj: Yo dogDate: Jul 30 21:39Hey, are you still the wiz for the Cybers?

Lets start with beginning. Roy, Rob, Symbio and I was on... Roy kills me as my ninja Sektor and insta blicks me from 280hp did not even see my monitor. So Rob and Symbio go to pk his ass. They get blicked too. This is due to the ninja morph of rangers. Well Symbio and Rob get mad cause rangers are O.P. so they decide to kill the command center. Gogeta gets mad when they start attackin the command center accusing symbio of cheating. He logs in his wizard Cleipa interfers with player affairs and calms the fight at command center. Then he proceeds to trans symio to the church acuse him of cheating. He threatened to jail and report Symbio Then symbio got sic of the bullshit mouth logged in Mo Dested cleipa and all hell broke loose. **charm**Subj: spsDate: Oct 11 12:21Dont go out of your way.... was just bored...figured id ask.. =) **kanji**Subj: continually losing heartbeatDate: Oct 17 21:43Everytime i go out to fight I am losing my heart beat shortly into battle. Also, backstab is not working correctly and wont let me use it, even with shadowstep engaged.  -Kanji **wicket**Subj: Idea...Cc: (To: dragnar) shinshiDate: Dec 11 07:40Here is a wild and crazy idea.... dont know how we could do it but.... christmas day.... christmas eve and the day before or maybe just eve and xmas day do 50% cost off on all non storeable heals. I.E. splooge medkits etc. Maybe we can draw in some play time and some more people. Just post the note on village green board and the nirvana webpage.... I think that would be awsome and would bring people in to kill..... Just a crazy suggestion.... Mail me back what ya think!!!! **dragnar**Subj: Login BonusCc: (To: fred) shinshi,sami,wicketDate: Dec 22 09:55I've had this idea every since I did prestige, and I want to work on it soon. I would like to give the players a prize for logging in on a regular basis. I was thinking daily and weekly prizes. Feel free to mail me ideas on what the prizes could be.  . Some idea I already have are gold, casino chips, heals etc. I also have some unique scrolls I have been working on for an upcoming area. They give unique 1 time abilities that raise your wc bonus, give a double xp, bless armor/weps, make any weapon unbreakable etc. I was thinking about using these for some of the bigger prizes. . Let me know any thoughts ideas you have. Thanks, --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: InfuseCc: **Date: Aug 10 22:55I started to do this but I'm not going to have time to finish it...so what you need to do is make an excel sheet. Put in some columns for the values you want to track like INF_MIN, INF_MAX etc. They are pretty simple calculations. Then you have a column for the level of the healer and the amount trying to be added. Then you can change the numbers and see how they come out. I think it is the only way to understand what is going on. If you get stuck let me know. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: helpCc: darkfire,storm,whitehawkDate: Aug 17 16:11Can you check the following help files for me and let me know any issues you see.

For example, mages, samurai, shardak, etc.  Since the player pool is so small, I feel there is no point in having the requirement of waiting for someone else to login in order to enjoy 25% of the content of the MUD.  Any objections?   **oberon** Re:   Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: vertebraker) dragnar,darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Sep 29 19:01I think sponsorships are an interesting aspect.. I'm not sure if I like seeing it deleted all together. So, as an idea, what if we keep sponsorship alive on those guilds but add a mob that will sponsor somebody for 80k coins. Now you have a way for people to buy it, or do it for free if a player is on.  - Oberon **rumplemintz** Re:   Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: oberon) vertebraker,dragnar,darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Oct  7 14:01I like the idea of the coin cost, as it's insanely easy to coin up these days anyway.  I do agree that it should be changed. **dragnar**Subj: RoguesCc: **Date: Oct 13 11:33Darude has a few issues today: tail /debug.log Connection reset by peer detected. Bad argument 1 to present() Current object was players/shinshi/closed/rogue/spells/sap, line 25 "cmd_hook" in "players/shinshi/closed/rogue/gob2.c" ("players/shinshi/closed/rogue/gob2#2186") line 91 "main" in "players/shinshi/closed/rogue/spells/sap.c" ("players/shinshi/closed/rogue/spells/sap") line 32 Bad argument 1 to present() Current object was players/shinshi/closed/rogue/spells/sap, line 25 "cmd_hook" in "players/shinshi/closed/rogue/gob2.c" ("players/shinshi/closed/rogue/gob2#2186") line 91 "main" in "players/shinshi/closed/rogue/spells/sap.c" ("players/shinshi/closed/rogue/spells/sap") line 32 Bad argument 1 to present() Current object was players/shinshi/closed/rogue/spells/backstab, line 11 "qtHook" in "obj/soul.c" ("obj/soul#2286") line 5 "process_hook" in "obj/soul.c" ("obj/soul#2286") line 5 "cmd_hook" in "players/shinshi/closed/rogue/gob2.c" ("players/shinshi/closed/rogue/gob2#2186") line 91 "main" in "players/shinshi/closed/rogue/spells/backstab.c" ("players/shinshi/closed/rogue/spells/backstab") line 42 **charm**Subj: monitorDate: Oct 14 16:48just one more idea to add to my list of suggestions....which i still hope you have. ....  3 ]since most healers do not participate in battle.... it would be nice to see the mobs hit points on the need monitor..... it would be convenient to know when they're about to die.... is this feasible? if you dont have my list... i'll be more then happy to give it to you again...haha...i have been patient!!  *charm* **dragnar**Subj: room.c Cc: (To: fred) rumplemintz,shinshi,sami,vertebraker,oberon,darkfire,mosobpDate: Oct 18 21:59I always liked the way some rooms that had call_outs in them shut them off when no players were in the room. I finally got around to adding the functionality to room.c.  You can use the new: set_call_out( string co, int interval, int rand_interval )  to set the name of the call_out function, the interval and random interval. . In the inherited room you do set_call_out in the reset, then define the function that will be the target of the call_out. I'll put an example in /doc/build/room/call_outs. --Gnar **"
