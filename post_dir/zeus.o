Also added code for victory messages to the arena stands.added help files for the guild NPC's for the basic commands.Basically just the stuff you told me about in spells.txt that you had as a todo list.Changes that were made since the guild opened you can see if you want in/players/fred/log/changesFred**forbin**Subj: unstorable items & museumCc: forbinDate: Feb 16 19:05Is there any specific reason some of your items do not store, other than past storage rules.  I'd like to make your nightpike and legendary platemail storable now that the rules have changed, but I wouldn't want to step on your toes if you have them unstorable for a reason.  Secondly, is there any chance we can re-open your Museum.  I know it could be a slaughter house at times, but it was something the players were fond of, and currently our playerbase stinks.  Perhaps letting them have a little fun would help.  I, for one, would like to see the Museum again.   Let me know what you think about these two issues.  Thanks.  Forbin **fred** Re:   hmmDate: Apr 11 13:50Yeah the honor_calc at the end of gob.c is what is used now.   You used to have it in the player_shadow in connection with the  hit_player() func.  When Illarion redid a bunch of stuff like  player.c and living.c and whatnot for damage types he stopped  using hit_player for general monster damage so the hit_player() in the player shadow basically stopped working unless they received damage from specials that specifally called the h[C[C[C[C[C[C[Cit_player() Illarion helped me out and we added a RegisterArmor in the gob and it runs stance_armor in /obj.

I may have to check them out and tone down the spam some.  Fred **fred**Subj: BF gemsCc: forbinDate: Apr 14 22:25Heys, I was thinking of updating Bale as far as gems go.  There are a lot of gems that people don't like because of one reason or another. Either they don't see the benefit or maybe like gem of pk they just don't pk.  I thought it would be nice if players could turn in gems or pawn them off so to speak for future benefit.  If they turned in a  gem they wouldn't actually receive any actual money.  They would receive a credit so to speak where a credit amount would just be stored on  the guild object.  Something along the lines of the bank except they wouldn't be able to ever take out just coins.  I'm not sure what would be an exceptable amount of 'credit' for a turned in gem.  I thought I would have a base price based on whether the gem was a spec1, spec2, or spec3.  Spec1 being the lowest and spec3 being worth the most since it is less likely a player would receive a spec3 gem making them more rare. I'm not sure what seems reasonable maybe 5k for spec1, 10k for spec2,  and 15k for spec3.  Then I would just throw in a + random(2000) or something so it wasn't always exactly the same amount.  When a player would try to buy a gem it would check to see if they have any credit available for use. If they did Bale would tell them they X amount of credit and see if they would like to pay with reg coins or work off their credit.  If they say credit it would either take the full amount off the credit if they had that much credit or it would put their credit to 0 and take the rest from their normal coin supply.  Let me know if you guys think this would be something that should or would be neat to have and I'll give it a go.  Also if you  like the idea let me know what you're thinking for amounts for gems or any other thoughts you'd like to throw in there.  Thanks.  Fred **fred** Re:   hmmCc: forbinDate: May  3 08:20Well I just recently changed rest.  I figured since most people would rest after ever fight and endurance regen is  pretty darn quick I'd give them a little heal/detox bonus while doing it.  Battle cry is run in the hb.

I've got cygwin and a basic LPmud setup on my home computer so I could run it for us whenever we needed it. I'm not talking about getting serious or anything with it, just kicking around ideas and I'd do most of the major code.

I really respect your opinions and ideas, and I think you're a great gamer.  btw, this mud would have nothing to do with nirvana. i'd probably ask some of the wizards here if they would want to wiz there as well (namely fred and vital) but it would be something we could have in the open, because i respect boltar enough not to pull a reflex and try to jack his player pool.  anyway, don't take this whole thing that seriously. just looking for ideas and maybe some writeups or docs when you can afford the time or feel like doing it. i understand if you're totally burned on muds.  :) **zeus**Subj: hmmCc: (To: vertebraker) zeusDate: May 23 01:13how important is walking when players can queu up directions?  in WoW traveling creates a feeling of size for the world, but obviously text has a hard time replicating that.  maybe traveling should be minimized except in situations where there is specifically progress to be made, such as in a wow-style instance.  nirvana lacks that type of goal-oriented experience which would be easier to tailor towards a number of players if we desired. or we could just code thousands of empty rooms with a short_desc of Grass Plains" :)  teleportation could allow for some interesting dynamics. especially if room creation was more flexibile as well.  just a thought. my finger is bleeding and it's lunch time.  bye~  nod **vertebraker** Re:   hmmDate: May 23 03:20i agree. i was thinking about making either mounts that could remember locations or have taxi services, trains, cars. etc.  i DO like the big muds, i.e. medievia where there is plenty of wilderness and stuff, i'm just not sure if i like that route or not. needs more pondering.  what did you mean if room creation was more flexible? just wondering. thanks.   and sorry about the dc's earlier, i have a big problem with my wireless at home **forbin**Subj: Possible Erilon bugCc: (To: fred) zeusDate: Jun  1 18:15Wipeout reported that there is a bug with Erilon.

If you wish to know what I am talking about, read some of the mails he has sent me.  Personally, I like the mud the way it is. I don't want to change it. I have no intention of dancing to some tune Earwax feels like playing on his flute. I do not, nor never have abused wizard powers. I occasionally snoop a player, but never when two players are in a room or chatting. And, I usually (almost always) tell a player if and when I am snooping them and also when I turn snoop off.  Its absurd that Earwax even brings that into a conversation about being a wizard.   Personally Boltar, I am sick and tired of his heavy handed way of dealing with things...and it's my opinion you are going to have a dead mud very soon because of it.  I will not tolerate someone who threatens, cajoles, and is otherwise a dick.   It is true I do not contribute to the mud much, other than the areas I did code and are in play.  However, I have never seen my contribution here to be one of code.  Wizards come and go...power hungry, unstable wizards have come and gone.  In almost every case where there has been an abuse of power, or a lack of good judgement, I have had a hand in resolving that issue...in some way or another.  And, I might add, you have usually backed me up in most of the disputes I have had some involvement in.  I don't really care what Earwax does. I do not have the juice, nor the time, nor really the interest anymore to try and corral his over-bloated ego...I suspect that issue, if its dealt with, will have to rest with you. apply sphere to being a wizard here...I've had a good run. I have enjoyed the game, and enjoyed for the most part the people I have met here.  If the current gestapo Earwax does indeed have his way and dewizes me, so be it.  Even though he feels otherwise, I still think I contribute something to the game...but as always, I will leave that up to you to decide. I am way too old and way to long in the tooth here to care much what some bully wizard dictates to me as being 'his way or the highway'.  Do you really want someone like this in charge of things to the point you give him THAT much authority?  Vert NEVER had an ego like Earwax. He NEVER abused any wizard power. He never, once he became a wizard, cheated the game. I cannot say the same for Earwax.  There is a WORLD of difference between Vertebraker and Earwax as far as Admin goes.  Personally, if Earwax is in charge, I don't want to be a wizard here. * **chip** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 04:07really? you don't snoop players chatting? then it's so funny how you knew the things my templar said to Earwax about a matter dealing with your templar who was on at the time, you drunk egotistical worthless fucking jackass. I think wax's ideas are going to be a huge improvement for the mud and will bring a much larger Pbase. only people who may find him a dick are the abusers/grievers/cheaters. so which category shall you place yourself in? take a pick, heh. no one needs to hear your whining when you're never even around to give any of it solid structure. find something better to do than bitch about things you're not even getting yourself involved in. if you don't like how things are, don't bitch. change em. which means come here more regularly. i've not found thing one wrong with the projects Earwax has proposed and begun. and i'm quite sure in my own mind, being a long time player myself, that this mud needs an admin like Earwax to weed out the weak and the whining. and if you're so heartbroken that the  mud will be doing so well here in the very near future just because you won't be involved to get recognition for it, then maybe you should be dewizzed. i personally will not be expecting recognition, for i'm not able to be involved due to heavy hitting life circumstances. tho, I'm not bitching either, because the place i have called home for over 10 years will continue to be home and a nice one at that. i just wish we could get more wizzes like Wax, Verte, Bolts and Fred around here. and as soon as humanly possible, i'm hoping to learn tons from all 4, Wax especially. Chip - Apprentice Developer (learning) **boltar** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: chip) zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 13:37  All,   If you have something to say, say it to me.

I take responsibility for not being socially  good enough myself to keep a peace and get people to work good enough  together. but the fact remains that unless we complete some serious  rennovations the mud will just slide into obscurity.   Since there is no one else to do it. All conflicts between wizards  will be resolved by me. Odds are everyone involved will hate my solutions so I advise living and let live as much as possible and don't do things that you know are going to result in conflict or displine or even questionable if you're seen/caught doing them.   I need productive people right now, not squabbles. Everyone needs to add something positive. I can't have people that just exist to cause conflict because they find it entertaining to do so. I don't need people getting pissed off at every little thing. What the mud needs, what I need for the mud are productive people.  It's that simple. And before there is any more squabbling, ask yourself where you(individuals) are on that, and that is the squabbling going to  lead to anything positive or just piss people off so we get even more  short handed?   I'll leave it at that.   -Bp  **chip**Subj: IMPORTANT REQUEST!Cc: (To: vertebraker) x,fred,earwax,khrell,sami,wipeout,subotai,jenny,jareel,jaraxle,jara,fakir,mosobp,mizan,sparrow,star,sparkle,jamila,kasia,demonic,springdawn,cooper,sundin,worm,katya,bella,viper,feldegast,snow,symbio,whitehawk,lostsoul,artos,achilles,doodle,recca,deacon,dustyrose,rek,vahiti,griswold,hugh,oghma,tristian,francesco,eurale,breeti,coglin,brittany,armblessed,third,armadillo,zeus,wtknight,cobain,haze,pavlik,mythos,arrina,llew,hawkeye,airwoman,trixDate: Jan 30 01:09We are trying to liven Nirvana back up, please at least consider making a return!
