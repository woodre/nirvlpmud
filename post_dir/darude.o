messages "dragnar** Re:   cd /players/guilds/dervishDate: Jul 21 14:16I adjusted it to fire a bit more. Hard to do without having humble spamming out constantly. Keep in mind your ex level plays a big part into your wc bonus so the messages should get better the higher level you are. Your sand points fire the messages off, but the message is a combo of sandpoints and ex lev. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: Set of ShadowsCc: (To: sami) symbio,darude,silverwindDate: Sep 28 12:27I made a change to how the set checks to see if you have the full set to try and reduce battle errors. Please let me know if you have any issues with it. **dragnar**Subj: leveled mobsCc: **Date: Jul 19 07:55You have a samurai right? I always thought pai-mai was cool how he was done and I wanted to do something similar. Would be a cool 2nd area for you to have something like ooze that works for extra levels and maybe prestige levels. Random brain dump over. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: PrestigeCc: **Date: Sep 21 11:50Mon Aug 10 00:46:58 2015 Darude adv from 0 to 1 with XP: 100159934 Fri Feb 26 22:00:35 2016 Darude adv from 1 to 2 with XP: 100746348 Mon Mar  7 19:28:07 2016 Darude adv from 2 to 3 with XP: 100321799 Sat Mar 12 13:32:04 2016 Darude adv from 3 to 4 with XP: 100240019 Sun Mar 27 13:54:07 2016 Darude adv from 4 to 5 with XP: 103207102 Mon Apr 25 18:41:53 2016 Darude adv from 5 to 6 with XP: 103535787 Sat May 21 12:30:22 2016 Darude adv from 6 to 7 with XP: 104727374 Fri May 27 14:58:13 2016 Darude adv from 7 to 8 with XP: 102122025 Wed Jun 15 09:25:39 2016 Darude adv from 8 to 9 with XP: 104106684 Tue Jun 21 11:13:53 2016 Darude adv from 9 to 10 with XP: 105686766 Sat Jun 25 11:31:28 2016 Darude adv from 10 to 11 with XP: 104507526 Wed Jun 29 10:53:34 2016 Darude adv from 11 to 12 with XP: 100943260 Mon Jul 11 17:15:43 2016 Darude adv from 12 to 13 with XP: 122174486 Fri Jul 15 09:57:47 2016 Darude adv from 13 to 14 with XP: 110158550 Sat Jul 23 12:58:13 2016 Darude adv from 14 to 15 with XP: 105837665 Thu Aug  4 10:35:19 2016 Darude adv from 15 to 16 with XP: 100221688 Mon Aug 15 11:23:01 2016 Darude adv from 16 to 17 with XP: 104755300 Wed Aug 24 10:28:18 2016 Darude adv from 17 to 18 with XP: 107507413 Wed Sep  7 15:49:17 2016 Darude adv from 18 to 19 with XP: 108228530 Fri Sep 16 17:49:23 2016 Darude adv from 19 to 20 with XP: 100986613 **dragnar**Subj: QuestsCc: **Date: Oct  4 08:22I did Morgoth's quest last night. Not needed for the quest, but the statues that come to life when you pry the gem made me remember being in that area when I was a player. When those statues came to life back in the day they scared the hell out of me lol. Then I checked my quest list for dragnar and realize I did that quest, along with the superman and disk quest etc. I have zero recall of doing those quests. Scary. Wish we had google drive back then :) --Gnar **shinshi**Subj: RoguesDate: Oct 16 08:02try offhand again - should be fixed  (X) Shinshi (X) **dragnar**Subj: locker exampleCc: (To: oberon) darudeDate: Oct 20 12:02soulbindmob.c - Mob that drops the weapon, sets the binder when it dies soulbind.c     - Weapon that tracks the soulbind, plus some specials I tested it and saved it in casino and it worked.
