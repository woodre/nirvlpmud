messages "earwax**Subj: weapon wear option for combat monitorDate: Mar 14 00:48I coded it months ago and it was merely waiting on being added, Fred was kind enough to finally take care of it and copied my mods over. help monvalues, #wep# shows a number....it's basically the higher the number the more wear on the weapon, the more at risk for breaking it is - a weapon can break almost any time, but it gets a LOT more likely as that particular number increases....and different weapons have different numbers where they get worse.  thanks for the idea rep btw  -earwax **"
