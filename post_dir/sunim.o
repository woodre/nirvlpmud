In this stillness, an oppertunity presides. An oppertunity for the rebirth of light and movement to this realm.  Our forefathers had a vision in which light would shine on every face in this realm. This vision lies in our sacred tablet. A vision of a world where every person was free to grow and enjoy themselves, one in which justice and honor were the true laws of the land, and every knee would bow to these precepts.  In this world, we are truely the harbringers of light, the slayers of evil, the bedrock upon which all goodness is built.   This very day, my brave friends, our realm rests in a state of peril. We now know a challenge unlike any other. The spirit of the challenge is upon us, and we will rise to it. We have an obligation and a duty to bring back the base of players here to this realm. How, you may ask, do we do this? We lead by example. We recruit a friend and play with them. We strike forth into the realm and uphold the precepts, and begin to shine forth again our good light.  Article 8 tells us that we are to shoulder the responsibilities of our stations readily. This is our station Knights, THIS will be our finest hour. It is time to come back and do that which must be done. **"
