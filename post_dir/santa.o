I asked around a bit first to see if you were one of the beggar sorts and the general consensus was that you hadn't really asked for a damn thing from anyone :) I find great honor in being self-sufficient and I enjoy lending a hand to those whom only strive to better themselves on their own and don't feel they always need a shoulder to lean upon. keep up the good work and i hope those items were a good help in your journey to becoming a great warrior here someday. Jacob, the Emperor PS Can I have a new power supply for my computer this Christmas??? ;) **"
