Thing's i've gone though, etc. When I was really young, my dad used to beat my mom, bad. Then one day when I was in the 1st grade, I get home from school and find my mother and sisters sitting arounf the livingroom crying. My mom had a letter from my dad. She explains that he had left, for good.. and wasnt coming back. It killed me, that he'd left without even 1 word other than that note. So, in school I kinda shut down.. I was picked on, bullied, told I was a loser, was good for nothing, etc etc.  My feelings were crushed, everyday in every way. I wanted so bad to be accepted, to be noticed, but at the time, I just lost all hope. I tried running away and anything else I could do to get away, make it stop hurting etc. A few years went by with me going crazy, misbehaving, etc. I actually failed 1st, 2nd and 5th grade. So in school I went  1st, 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, jail. The years I did pass, like second time in 1st, 2nd, 5th etc it was just that I was too old.. they had to push me forward. So, everyone, even some teachers would call me a loser, talk down on me, treat me like trash. I didnt have a father to help me through it, etc. Then one day.. I just woke up, I realized I wasnt going anywhere in life. That if I let everyone treat me like that.. and didnt ignore it and just be true to myself, regardless of what anyone said or though, though* I'd be exactly that.. a loser. So I said fuck it, I gave everyone the finger, told them all to fuck off, and started doing everything 'my' way.. if anyone liked it or not. I stood tall, I tried hard and in the end, I started shining brighter than all of them. In everything I do these days, i'm noticed and I do well.. because of that attitude, I know I am great, regardless of what anyone says. IRL, I'm 34, I own my own company, I'm the boss. In this game, everyone here either looks up to me, respects me or fears me. If they admit it or not. So, what i'm getting at.. you should never consider hurting yourself when your feelings get hurt. Never let anyone drive you to something like that. Ignore them, be true to yourself. Know that you matter. Stand tall, try hard, ignore the retards in life and you'll do great. Because everyone at some point gets hurt or bullied, even the big bad worm. :P Its what you do about it that defines you, makes you what you are etc.  Take care. -me **shinshi**Subj: HeyCc: (To: star) mizan,fred,worm,chip,lok,fervens,fireman,meadowDate: Aug 28 21:14I will be gone from August 29th until September 5th.
