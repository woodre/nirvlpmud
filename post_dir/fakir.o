IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NECCESSARY!Cc: (To: vertebraker) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: May 20 13:47I'm at a lost for how/why - but this is an issue that calls for IMMEDIATE solutions.  Apparently there is a coin glitch that occurs when players idle out while sitting in a room (hotel room that I know of).  When the player returns, they have what I'd call an assload of coins:  Achilles had almost 1.5 million after returning today.   Forbs **earwax**Subj: object trackingCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Jul  4 04:21Object tracking has been added to the lib code...see /obj/objtracker.c This code is inherited by the various weapon/armor/treasure/bag/etc objects and tracks instances where multiple characters from the same ip end up with the same item.  The instances will be logged to /log/OBJECT_VIOLATIONS Take those entries with a grain of salt, it's very easy to eventually end up (within a reboot) with gear from an alt char, at times, but this is a tool for tracking repeat violations and extreme ones. It replaces mizan's object tracking, which was extremely resource- heavy, and very limited, through no fault of his, merely the lack of opportunity to implement it on the lib-level.  -Earwax **earwax**Subj: violations log for gear passingCc: (To: stardream) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Jul 11 00:32/log/OBJECT_VIOLATIONS - they are now part of the lib and will trigger  for ALL characters passing gear to chars from their own ip - also  note that they receive a message upon receipt of gear from another char, something to the effect of 'Logging gear passing between chars' This is intended to eliminate this type of action as much as possible, and make it so they can't say 'i didn't know' ... if there are patterns emerging, well, hey, it's not like they didn't know.  Please check this log - mail me or edit /log/OBJECT_VIOLATIONS at the entry in order to indicate that entries have been acted upon,  -ew **earwax**Subj: wlog changeCc: (To: vertebraker) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Jul 20 15:10wlog has been changed to now add all entries to /log/WR/WORK_REPORT as well as individual wizard work reps, typing 'wlog' without an arg  will show both your own log and the central log.  I'd ask that anyone using their own custom wlog at the least add in the log to the central report or use the standard command.  -ew **earwax**Subj: Code standards docsCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Aug  8 03:58I've put them in /doc/build/code_standards and /doc/build/headers Please take a look at them and let me know if there's anything else I need to address, or anything I should change.

I've been asking for it for months, but I haven't seen anything.  Yesterday, I recommended automatic dewizzing of all wizards not involved, so I'm trying to prevent this because it WILL happen otherwise.  In other words, I'm trying to see work done, so this doesn't happen, although if it doesn't I'm the  one to blame and the first to take the blame, because I fully intend to dewiz every single individual that does not get involved.  I have the position, I have the power, and i'm using it, is the bottom line.  If you want to keep your wizard get involved with this.  It's seriously the most important project in the last 15 years.  -david (dhalek@comcast.net) **earwax**Subj: I want you to hear it from me.Date: Oct  6 07:32We have our issues.  But bottom line is you are a 100+ plus and you haven't done a fucking thing.  Instead, you have done nothing but  badmouth the changes I'm proposing, yet without proposing anything of your own.  I've tried to get you involved, other seniors have, but you haven't done shit, all you do is try to put players against us.  I'm giving you the opportunity to be involved heavily in the LDMUD  project, I've explained it before, I'll explain it again, but it's  the single-most important project in 15 years.  It's up to you, but the bottom line, is you will no longer be a wizard if you choose to not get involved with the future of this mud.  That is a fact.  It's up to you, we've tried very hard to bring you along, and I'm trying to give you a final option because in my own personal opinion you ARE a very solid player and a very knowledgable one and you truly care  about the game.    What I will not tolerate is you sitting on the side using no wizard commands other than snoop, for no valid reasons, and bitching on  channels but offering no constructive solutions.  Take that how you want, take it to whoever you want.  You have your options, you can be an influence or you will not have a wizard.  Period.  This game's gone on long enough.  I want you to be a positive part of this game, because frankly we need as much input as possible to make it improve, but you're working against that.    This is my final effort, and it's more than I need to make, I'm ust really hoping you talk to me on this, I've made the effort before, but you're one of the very few wizards that really play and understand the game, so your input is valuable.  The dewizzing process will be basically automatic, it will go off of who is listed as being a contributor to the current efforts, and that's it.  We (verte and me) don't care about the past, it's about what we're doing to improve the future.  Talk to me.  -David **chip** Re:   dewizzingCc: zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 04:07really? you don't snoop players chatting? then it's so funny how you knew the things my templar said to Earwax about a matter dealing with your templar who was on at the time, you drunk egotistical worthless fucking jackass. I think wax's ideas are going to be a huge improvement for the mud and will bring a much larger Pbase. only people who may find him a dick are the abusers/grievers/cheaters. so which category shall you place yourself in? take a pick, heh. no one needs to hear your whining when you're never even around to give any of it solid structure. find something better to do than bitch about things you're not even getting yourself involved in. if you don't like how things are, don't bitch. change em. which means come here more regularly. i've not found thing one wrong with the projects Earwax has proposed and begun. and i'm quite sure in my own mind, being a long time player myself, that this mud needs an admin like Earwax to weed out the weak and the whining. and if you're so heartbroken that the  mud will be doing so well here in the very near future just because you won't be involved to get recognition for it, then maybe you should be dewizzed. i personally will not be expecting recognition, for i'm not able to be involved due to heavy hitting life circumstances. tho, I'm not bitching either, because the place i have called home for over 10 years will continue to be home and a nice one at that. i just wish we could get more wizzes like Wax, Verte, Bolts and Fred around here. and as soon as humanly possible, i'm hoping to learn tons from all 4, Wax especially. Chip - Apprentice Developer (learning) **earwax** Re:   dewizzingCc: boltar,vertebraker,fred,illarion,francesco,forbin,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Oct  8 06:24Let's see.  Whatever I'm allowed to get away with.  Personally I'd rather not make decisions, I'd rather just code, that's what I'm good at and what I enjoy.  Babysitting a bunch of grown adults does nothing but irritate me and make me less productive.  I like to figure out  problems and code solutions to them.  This is my enjoyment, and it's the surrogate challenge for me, since the game is simply too easy as a player.  Now, the shit with the triggers, you yourself said and know that it wasn't like it was beneficial to me.  I was dealing with  exhaustion pure and simple.  But that's beside the point, I did what I did, but it still pales in comparison to your own abuses.  I made a mistake, you made repeated mistakes, and more than that, you haven't done anything positive for the game in years, and you have worked hard to be negative.  You bitch, but offer no solutions nor put forth any work.  The work I've done in one single object alone is more than your sum total of code in this game, ever, not to mention the simple fact that it's years beyond your comprehension or POTENTIAL level of  improvement.    If we want to get into specifics, I've done my best, other wizards have as well, to get you involved with improvements in the game.  Instead,  you're content with a slow death over the years, a slow reduction in playerbase each year, until this mud dies, whereas I'm doing everything I can to get as much influence from players and wizards to come up with solutions.  Not only that but I'm putting out thousands of lines of code, working with every wizard I can to teach them and tutor them, improve their skills, and encourage them, whereas you're most happy when you can sit on star and just talk shit about people as a playerchar.  I'm responding here, in this way, because you forced this.  The bottom line is that you spend your time on as a wizard griping and using the snoop command.  I spend mine coding and teaching others and encouraging others and administrating.  This is not even an implication, it's  simple fact.  The logs, the inherits and bug logs and everything else and every wizard on here, pretty much, speak for this, without me having to, yet you want to have a pissing contest.  How about this, put up, shut up, and have a positive impact other than resting on a single, minor area, you did however many years ago, with no positive impact since, instead of trying to put down my efforts.  Ego?  You're real funny, since you aren't even a competant builder, talking about someone that is a highly competant coder, that is doing their best to incorporate the ideas of everyone playing and coding for the game, especially where you just gripe and offer no solutions or work.  When you actually make a contribution open your mouth.  But that isn't going to happen, so just shut the fuck up.  -Earwax/David Halek **fakir**Subj: bullshitCc: (To: earwax) boltar,fakir,xDate: Oct  8 10:52If my being a wizard here is somehow hindering your efforts to take over the mud, then by all means de-wiz me!  I know how difficult it can be to have your own way with these kids you insta-wiz (like chip) if someone else is around watching what you do, both as a wizard and as a player.  There were three (3) other wizards logged in who were well aware of your trigger cheat...but not one of them even paid attention nor had the  balls to call you on it.  Well, gosh, I wonder why. apply sphere to your ego, all one needs do is read the venom and self angrandization (not a real word, I know, but it describes what I see)alias to get a feel for what a king size ego you really have.  I am in awe of your greatness! As to what YOU do, as I said before, I don't give a SHIT. It  is what B does that will interest me.  If he allows you to  have complete and udder control of this mud, then so be it. If that is the case, I don't want to be a wizard here. I can  tolerate you being a wizard...but I could not tolerate you  being a wizard that has any fucking thing to do with me or what I do here.  In my opinion, you are sadly lacking in any kind of people skills, your ego IS far larger than any I  have encountered here, and your heavy handed, bullying style of management is going to drive ppl away from the mud rather than bring them in...regardless of what you do as a coder. Personally, I think the reason you want me gone is so you CAN do more as you wish, rather than as you should.  I'm about  the only one here who would actually call you on something. Bottom line, Earwax, is that you can rant and rave all you  want...its still Boltar who calls the shots here.  I'll  abide by whatever HE decides, not you.  And by the way, my  usage of the term 'udder' was not incorrect.  I think you are starting to feel like this mud is your own tit, to squeeze or manipulate however you wish.  Thats just sad. **boltar** Re:   my areasDate: Oct  8 13:34 1) Earwax is as I recall older than I or at least really close in age. 2) mailing unreadable rants and cc'ing everone you can think of doesn't    help whatever it is the case you are making. 3) various threats, demands, etc do not help it either.   I just got back from a business trip.

I take responsibility for not being socially  good enough myself to keep a peace and get people to work good enough  together. but the fact remains that unless we complete some serious  rennovations the mud will just slide into obscurity.   Since there is no one else to do it. All conflicts between wizards  will be resolved by me. Odds are everyone involved will hate my solutions so I advise living and let live as much as possible and don't do things that you know are going to result in conflict or displine or even questionable if you're seen/caught doing them.   I need productive people right now, not squabbles. Everyone needs to add something positive. I can't have people that just exist to cause conflict because they find it entertaining to do so. I don't need people getting pissed off at every little thing. What the mud needs, what I need for the mud are productive people.  It's that simple. And before there is any more squabbling, ask yourself where you(individuals) are on that, and that is the squabbling going to  lead to anything positive or just piss people off so we get even more  short handed?   I'll leave it at that.   -Bp  **vertebraker**Subj: fakirCc: (To: boltar) earwax,fakirDate: May  5 02:59I rewizzed fakir.
