It's just a pool of coins.  As a neo if you want to buy a cave it just deducts the amount from the pool you never actually retrieve them.  Since the  Neo's aren't open right now you do not have the option of trying to  fight your symbiote.  Fred **fred** Re:   neos againDate: Jun  2 18:03Strength and Dexterity are their main stats.   Naturally stamina is always important as well. Although your spells aren't exactly powerful they are helpful so magic too.  Other than that none of the stats are directly guild related but may be used in armors/weapons if you ever have to fight unchanged.  Fred **"
