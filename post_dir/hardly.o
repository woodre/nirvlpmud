We are going to start working on learning the basics of LPC and I have a link for you that may help you learn the basics of coding. Try to go through this as you would a textbook and write down any notes or questions about things you might not fully grasp. Here it is:  http://www.geas.de/tutorial/lpc_toc.html  I'm a big fan of that tutorial because it assumes that the reader has no previous knowledge of programming and does a good job at explaining the concept of object oriented programming. Just don't rush, we have all of the time in the world. -S **vertebraker**Subj: sparrowDate: Sep 27 13:57Hey, is Sparrow helping you?
