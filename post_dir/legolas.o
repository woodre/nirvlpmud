messages "aingeal** Re:   ExplanationDate: Jan 10 18:34Beloved Legolas, You cannot imagine how much of a relief it was to hear from you.  I had become quite worried.  I should have emailed you, perhaps, but I was reluctant to do so, not knowing why you had absented yourself.  Thank you for letting me know where you are, and why you have been away. It sounds as if all is going well in your life.  I have not been on AIM for some time, as I generally use MSN, but I am going to check AIM this very eve to see if I can  find you.  I miss you terribly, and would love to talk with you.  If you receive this,  and have not yet spoken with me on AIM, please email me.  My email address has not changed - it is still twobadlizards@hotmail.com. Please know that you are in my thoughts...... Yours evermore, Feyth **"
