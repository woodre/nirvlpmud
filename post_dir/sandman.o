I don't know what rules Boltar is givingyou guys, but I've been required to keep a log of all lib changesI make.  Just for reference, this is in/log/WR/vertebraker_libreportOriginally it was in a /closed, but I figured this might help somejunior wizards and keep them up-to-date on fixes without postingeverything first.**vertebraker**Subj: one more thingCc: painDate: Sep 19 14:30Sorry about the multiple mails, I hope I don't havethat many more coming :)I am always at your disposal [or rather, your request]for any coding issues or implementation help you may need.Don't hesitate to ask :)**vertebraker**Subj: play devDate: Sep 19 15:01I think you're head of Player Development.Just wanted you to know that if you're interestedin creating emotes [I figure this comes under yourterritory], I created a pretty nifty device for handlingall the proper checks, only requires about four or fivecommands to use it.Let me know if you want it, and I'll hook you up.**boltar**Subj: chartCc: (To: pain) sandman,vertebraker,daranathDate: Sep 19 18:50in /closed is the org chart. We need to get this filled out.  I would like it if all you participate in that process.Of what is filled out, pain will be the senior sub manager with daranath handling the day-to-day item. I think that dar can handle most of it on his own with pain being the reference of seniority and experience to make the tougher calls. Of course anything major I want to make pronouncements on. You've probably all noticed reflex on the chart. His job will be basically to asist dar and pain. to carry out tasks, but not to be a decision maker on policy. hence the danglingchart location. I think the rest of the fill ins are straight forward, but if people have better ideas I am open to them. Also needed are ideas to fill inthe rest. We need to get this done and I am counting on all of youseto help.**boltar** Re:   loggingCc: (To: vertebraker) sandman,painDate: Sep 19 22:42 I don't expect that pain and sandman will be making many lib changes.But yes there needs to be some record keeping. And letting me know of big changes, not just logging em.**jareel**Subj: 5 add stuffCc: pain,daranathDate: Sep 19 23:47Hero Questing - Something a player could do at +100 or +50 cost/risk could be huge              people could quest for unique powers items.  Keeping people              thinking what they would like, in turn would give wizards an Idea           of what players want to see, to keep ideas fresh.High end challengs - Only example we have of a high end challenge right now                   is the elemental test.Gear save   -  Items should save on people, would be ezier on players in case of             a crash.  Items you killed for yourself should be only usable by                the player who got it.Non-Guild Goals - +100 is a non - guild goal cant really think of another.Wiz that is outspoken and opionated - Wait thats me...I am peopbably one of the                                     5 or 6 high end players here so my ideas                                    are to that degree more. -Peace out, you want a piece of my mind ill give it to ya...**jareel**Subj: Risk/Reward vs. BalenceCc: (To: pain) sandman,eurale,forbin,zeus,daranathDate: Sep 21 01:45I am going to make an argument about balanceI am a little hot headed and I will admit to that but here go's my argument.Mondar StatsLevel -25HP-1000AC -25 27 due to armor wornWC-45EXP Value -87000Gets an extra attack every roundGame spell is 40% random 50Gets one of the following spells everyround10% Fistsmash     - Random 25+10 Damage10% Heal potion  - +50 hpts to monster10%heal berries   -+50 hpts to monster10%spirit attack   -Random 50+50 Damage30% bladesharp    -Random 35+5 Damage30% nothing    This is his reward -2 Swords Value 1100 coins, WC 17 Return of 1A small bag that hold like a normal bagA Highden Potion worth 2400 coinsA Highden Berries Worth 2400 coinsA Ring that's AC 2 and has a random 10 chance to do 1+random 3 damageVS Rock (Monster is Sabers realm)Level 17Hpts - 500AC - 12WC - 24XP Value - 3168This is the rewardAC - 2 Ring type armorAn Amber Gem worth - 100 coinsTalking Balance and talking Risk/Reward if a player wishes to try a monster that is as hard a kill as Mondar shouldn't that player be rewarded with a better item than a player that killed Rock?  This is a game where Items are what make the game kewl, if I as a player got a ring from an 87000 exp monster, I would hope it was better than a ring I got from a 3000 xp monster, it may not be but shouldn't there be a reward for taking a risk?Well that's my argument and not sure if, or how it will be taken.  So the ball is your court Eurale.-Peace out Jareel**reflex**Subj: NirchartCc: (To: boltar) pain,sandman,daranathDate: Sep 21 07:15Thank you for the sort of vote of confidence, but I respectufllydecline.  I will continue in my current role for now.  SinceFrancesco showed interest in the position, maybe he would be abetter fit, despite his lack of english skills.Good luck!-Reflex**kimmuriel**Subj: heyaCc: chinaDate: Sep 22 00:08 i'll be back to drop in .. prayin for mail. ;) thanks again -worm**vertebraker**Subj: invasionCc: vertebrakerDate: Sep 23 22:45working on the invasion master object yet .. it was working [kinda], stillfixing stuff and working on add-ons .. to carry out the invasion,there are only two necessary objs:1] The master object [which I am working on]and2] The monster objectA couple of necessary things for the monster object:We can have any kind of monsters we want.However I would like to make it one big monster objectthat perhaps would choose a random form.Therefore we could have an Undead Invasion, let's say,and we could have different kinds of zombies and skeletons,except all in the same file, just each form is chosen randomlyat reset().Make sense?I hope so.Anyway, if you're still confused, check out some early code i didin ~/swamp/NPC/beast.cThat's an example of what i'm talking about .. a random,form-less npc that "morphs" into something else, of coursethe player doesn't see that.One func that is necessary in the monster objis query_invasion_type() ..this will describe what "kind" of Invasion is being carried out.. i.e. "Smurf"Take a look at what I have, hopefully it isn't too sloppy so far,realize it isn't loading atm and it's full of holes I'm sure,but that should give you a general idea of what I'm going for.				tom/verte**vertebraker**Subj: one more thingDate: Sep 23 22:46Oh, the master obj I am working on is in ~/i-daemon.cSorry about that :)**jareel**Subj: Risk/Reward vs. Balance argumentDate: Sep 24 00:17I have recently been told by a few wizards that Eurale avoids confrontation, not sure if this is what he is doing.  Someone also said that he is picking on me because he doesn't like me, since he has been going over my code for 3 months and giving me 1 thing to fix once a week, and then yelling at me when its not fixed like immediatly(Example, my vines in my healing shop had the word vine in the description, I fixed it two days after he told me and recieved a mail saying I am trying to help you if your not going to be seriouse about this Ill stop helping you)  I do not want to believe he doesn't like me, and that this is personal, but the longer he ignores me the more I am buying that fact.Its been 4 days now.  Still waiting.  Peace out.**vertebraker**Subj: duneCc: (To: boltar) pain,sandmanDate: Sep 24 13:09Dune's interested in a higher position, and since he's been here a damnlong time [altho he's only been back around as of recent, but he's been][busy coding and so forth], I think he should get it.He's done a great job of keeping CyberNinjas in balance over the years,he's caught-up with the rules and ins and outs of the mud for the most part.Rather than head up a division right now, I think it'd be good if perhapshe could do Guild Approving and/or Area Approval, since he's coded bothand is one of the few active wizards who is very fluent in LPC andC-derivative languages.Let me know what you think :)**vertebraker**Subj: clan ideaDate: Sep 24 13:11Still working on that invasion daemon ..I wanted to ruminate a doc with you that I wrote up a few monthsago.

I readded the entrance or may, I have like 10 wizards telling me you hate me and want me to not be a wiz, is one of the reasons I am pretty defensive about stuff when you look at it.  Am gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and hope you 'REALLY' are just trying to help.-Peace Jareel**wren**Subj: ideas for gameCc: (To: pain) sandman,wrenDate: Sep 25 01:33Greetings,These are just a few things I thought of that could be helpful for both players and wizards. I'll try to be conciseso if something needs more explaining just holler.  1. Hidden Alignment Stat.The idea would be that players set an alignment for a character at creation (we'd have to either leave off or add on to existing chars)This hidden stat would be only viewable by wizards and possibly hinted at by game spells. This would allow more options for roleplaying and make things like the visible alignment make more sense. Could change the xp bonus for killing opposite alignment to also query that you are matching your true moral compass. One immediate benefit of this wouldbe to get players to develop a character in one alignment instead of guild bouncing.   2. Armors.I think we need to add a few other standard armor types. Such as dividing those worn on hand into ring and gauntlet. Perhaps a category on leggings broken down from main armor. This would have several benefits. Wizards geta wider variety of items that can be coded to create interesting fullsuitsof armor. And we can increase the exploration of players since we give them additional armor types to seek out. Also by making ring a seperate category possibly subdivided into right and left hands, we make way for enchanted ringswith various effects even non-combat based which again gets the players moving.   3. Guild examplesThis is more for the younger low lvls wizards. It would be nice if there werea few more and better explained examples of how to start guilds. I personally have a couple miniguild ideas that I would like to try to develop but I don'tunderstand the daemonization and such that would be useful in there creation.I personally like having the miniguilds around because it helps to break up the cookie cutter characters in the same guild (if the miniguild is roleplayed some).I'll break this into a second note so it doesn't get completely unwieldy.**dune**Subj: nevermindCc: (To: vertebraker) sandmanDate: Oct  8 06:41Oh, nevermind about the clans.I just fingered vertebraker and apparently there'swork being done on this already.Dune**jaryn**Subj: Wizard StatusDate: Jul  1 10:45Hello,I am looking for approval to be a wiz.I have been a player for many years.I finnally decided to quest and seek wizard status.Eurale has told me he would sponsor me.If you have any questions you would like to ask me, feel freeto contact me in game or mail me here.Thank you,Jaryn**eurale**Subj: forbinCc: (To: boltar) sandman,pain,beck,fakir,jaraxle,fredDate: Jul  6 10:20As a senior wiz, Forbin left under less than 'ideal' conditions and yanked allhis code.  I am reluctant to allow this kind of individual a 'free pass' backinto the wiz ladder.  I might also add that I would never consider advancing himback to senior status where he'd have access to everyone's code.  I hope wegive careful consideration to who is allowed 'back' from Reflex's failed attemptat a mud.  Just my thoughts....     -Eurale**martha**Subj: SponsorshipCc: (To: eurale) vital,fred,fakir,jaraxle,vertebraker,pain,sandman,zeus,beck,wocket,hawkeyeDate: Oct 29 23:01Hello all...after 10 long years, I have FINALLY completed thequests needed to ask if I can become a wizard.

I was refered to you by my original sponsorVital.  It was a lon ghard road for me, being I have been off and onquesting for about seven to eight years now, but only reciently reallyput alot of effort into it.  I sincerely hope to be an asset to this MUD inmy future plans for my castle/area.  I eagerly look forward to learninghow to code and made this a more exciting game.Khrell**khrell**Subj: Wizard ApprovalsCc: (To: fred) eurale,jaraxle,wocket,sandman,fakir,vertebraker,pain,boltarDate: Jan 29 02:34Dear sir,I write this letter in an attempt to let you know my intentions of becomminga wizard on this MUD.  For quite awhile I had stopped playing here and was focusedmore on real life and such.  Receintly I have returned to this MUD and resumedmy long standing attempt to gather the needed quest points in order to becomea wizard here.  Some might think me to be a poor choice as a wizard here,others are indifferent and the rest would welcome my addition to the growingranks of wizards here.  All I ask is that I be given a chance to prove myselfhere.  I am sincere in my wishes to code here and I only wish to better thisplace.  Hopefully those of you can look past your misconceptions of me and giveme a chance to show and create my ideas.Khrell**puppy**Subj: access to the mini guildsCc: (To: boltar) pain,sandman,vertebraker,puppyDate: Jan 31 22:22I was thinking that I wanted to create a canine mini guild (just fur my own amusement.)

If you see me on feel free to ask me whatever you please, and if I see you logged on I will introduce myself properly and explain my interests to you.--Jamila**fakir**Subj: exp bonus/etc.Cc: (To: vertebraker) boltar,wocket,vital,fred,jaraxle,pain,sandmanDate: May 25 22:00I like your idea of an exp. drawback. I think it would encourage exploration and at the very least, encourage players to kill in multiple areas. Very excellent thinking. How hard would it be to impliment? I am in favor of it.**"
