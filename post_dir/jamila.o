I really like you and enjoy talking with you, your such a sweetie, I'm not exactly ready to tie the ring quite yet, until I get myself some more time for your hot little ass. I'm trying not to be selfish or anything and I know you want to get married but please just be patient babe, it'll be soon, maybe not as soon as you like but I do like you lots ;). Okay, just letting you know what's up, I hope you are doing good.  Lots of love       ~Roy**busta**Subj: yaDate: Apr 23 03:01hey babe, im sorry for getting in your personal shit, i feel stupid now.  I am sorry and i wont do it again.
