Today, sat 5 about 10:30 CST there was an issue with Whitehawk. I am not sure how long he has been a ranger but, Whitehawk is acting like a juvenile throwing temper tantrum because Oz (a Knight)   would not let him in his party yesterday that happened to have some  rangers in it. He continued to argue with Oz over the channel wanting an answer why he would not let him in the party. Today Myself Viper, and Gogeta tried to get him to drop the subject and he refused. We talked together on a c channel then decied to talk to him about it. Whitehawk seems to think if you are a Ranger or a Ranger ally you should help level   up others. In talking to Viper and Gogeta he is fighting a short bit then going idle and trying to mooch exp from others. We tried to explain to him that we are a team guild but that did not mean 1 that ally are required to put you in their party and thatyou should not expect to mooch off others, rather that we all are to help others out! After a short talk with him he said he did not want to 'listen to reason' and he logged off.  So, we are bringing this issue of weather or not Whitehawk should be a Ranger or not to you!! Maybe if you talked to him it could correct his way of thinking, not sure! he seems to get mad quickly, and react quickly without thinking about role-playing his character.  If he want to be a Ranger then he really needs to be a Ranger and not continually through temper tantrums. If you could please let the three of us know what the conclusion of this issue is, please mud-mail us! Thanks Joab **mantis**Subj: necro armor and gearCc: (To: vertebraker) vitalDate: Nov  6 11:48Necro armor and gear wear seems to be all messed up and whacko.

It doesn't require your permission, your favor or your blessing. While all of his decisions may not accurately reflect the feelings of the whole guild, they don't have to either. As for whether the guild "will not tolerate this action", that is something that can easily be addressed by not partying with them. It would be more Rangerly if you helped they regardless of their actions and helped to teach them [NICELY] how to improve their conduct.  Either way, I will be getting in touch with him. --vital **hercules**Subj: RE: viperDate: Nov  7 15:09A.he didnt recruiit.... B.I dont care who does,but whoever does need to take responsiblity for thier recruits , like hoyle said in his note C.

If you wish to know what I am talking about, read some of the mails he has sent me.  Personally, I like the mud the way it is. I don't want to change it. I have no intention of dancing to some tune Earwax feels like playing on his flute. I do not, nor never have abused wizard powers. I occasionally snoop a player, but never when two players are in a room or chatting. And, I usually (almost always) tell a player if and when I am snooping them and also when I turn snoop off.  Its absurd that Earwax even brings that into a conversation about being a wizard.   Personally Boltar, I am sick and tired of his heavy handed way of dealing with things...and it's my opinion you are going to have a dead mud very soon because of it.  I will not tolerate someone who threatens, cajoles, and is otherwise a dick.   It is true I do not contribute to the mud much, other than the areas I did code and are in play.  However, I have never seen my contribution here to be one of code.  Wizards come and go...power hungry, unstable wizards have come and gone.  In almost every case where there has been an abuse of power, or a lack of good judgement, I have had a hand in resolving that issue...in some way or another.  And, I might add, you have usually backed me up in most of the disputes I have had some involvement in.  I don't really care what Earwax does. I do not have the juice, nor the time, nor really the interest anymore to try and corral his over-bloated ego...I suspect that issue, if its dealt with, will have to rest with you. apply sphere to being a wizard here...I've had a good run. I have enjoyed the game, and enjoyed for the most part the people I have met here.  If the current gestapo Earwax does indeed have his way and dewizes me, so be it.  Even though he feels otherwise, I still think I contribute something to the game...but as always, I will leave that up to you to decide. I am way too old and way to long in the tooth here to care much what some bully wizard dictates to me as being 'his way or the highway'.  Do you really want someone like this in charge of things to the point you give him THAT much authority?  Vert NEVER had an ego like Earwax. He NEVER abused any wizard power. He never, once he became a wizard, cheated the game. I cannot say the same for Earwax.  There is a WORLD of difference between Vertebraker and Earwax as far as Admin goes.  Personally, if Earwax is in charge, I don't want to be a wizard here. * **boltar** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) earwax,francesco,pavlik,stardream,jenny,pain,zeus,wocket,feldegast,vital,jaraxle,eurale,khrell,pestilence,puppy,star,wren,angel,martha,gemini,jamila,catt,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,aquila,kain,lacar,brittany,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,airwoman,catacomb,veehsan,haji,hair,skie,chip,sampson,vertebraker,xDate: Oct  8 21:41  How do we lose players/wizards?   1) personality conflicts, gossip, social bullshit.  2) bored because of a lack of new challenges.   That's it in a nutshell. I take responsibility for not being socially  good enough myself to keep a peace and get people to work good enough  together. but the fact remains that unless we complete some serious  rennovations the mud will just slide into obscurity.   Since there is no one else to do it. All conflicts between wizards  will be resolved by me. Odds are everyone involved will hate my solutions so I advise living and let live as much as possible and don't do things that you know are going to result in conflict or displine or even questionable if you're seen/caught doing them.   I need productive people right now, not squabbles. Everyone needs to add something positive. I can't have people that just exist to cause conflict because they find it entertaining to do so. I don't need people getting pissed off at every little thing. What the mud needs, what I need for the mud are productive people.  It's that simple. And before there is any more squabbling, ask yourself where you(individuals) are on that, and that is the squabbling going to  lead to anything positive or just piss people off so we get even more  short handed?   I'll leave it at that.   -Bp  **maddog**Subj: just checking inCc: (To: stardream) vertebraker,vital,mizan,doodleDate: Nov  9 22:11You know it's not that easy to get rid of me.

I do know though Ritcher will most likely be making a return, he's Cloud and Cloud's back so he's likely to want to play his Ranger with us at times once Ritcher's player file is restored. but there should be some spaces for people who will be active to become new recruits rather than keeping the list as is with non-members and ones who won't return. you know as well as me man, this isn't fair to those who will be active and want to play a ranger and would do well as one. let me know what you think and what happens so I can keep an ear open for feesible prospects. also if you could, if and when you update the roster list post a news/guild board bulletin about it so people will know there's going to be openings and those who fit the bill of who and what we're looking for, can ask around with us Rangers and see about some new blood. let me know what's up bro. pz! Seph, The Eggplant Bastard!

I dewizzed him a few minutes ago, as well as resetting his xp, xlevel, stats, guild path, autoloads, etc.  For those that this is cc'd to, it's due to the recent episode in  which he dested a mob, while an invis player was present, then came in as a playerchar and picked up the drop from that mob.

It's not  something new, I decided this a while ago, but didn't want to put myself in a position where it would happen.    I'm, quite frankly, just tired of going through the same old pattern of  getting motivated, trying to get things done, and ending up just moving  laterally.  If we're going to move forward, which should be the goal, then  we should be doing so actively.  This really hasn't been the case for a  long time.  I'm speaking of the LDMUD project of course.  In order to progress, we need to get the playtesting and bugfixing done.   This means we have to get the players over there somehow, playing and the  devs over there, fixing.  I've done some cheerleading and prodding in that,  and that's something that's not my strong-suit, I started with the points  and rewards thing, but, in the end, I'd have to code every bit of it, and  probably have to do all the documentation for it as well, and that's just  too big of a job for one person, just for something to give incentives for  people to playtest and debug the new driver.    I'm sick of talking about it, sick of defending it, or trying to push  people into working on it, I'm sick of feeling that I look like a complete  idiot chasing a Quixotic pipe-dream, and I'm sick of the ups and downs of  thinking, well, this time we'll get it done, etc; it hasn't happened  yet, and I doubt it will.  I came back here after this last absence earlier than intended.  I had  been told about the mysql being added, which of course, makes me say to myself, wow, finally some initiative by someone; in addition, you're all full of motivation about it: in a week, we'll go live, yadda yadda... over a day and a half later, absolutely nothing has been done yet.  There isn't so much as a post on the board or news, but the same stupid sign to go vote - for a mud that can't retain newbies - is running.  And the work being done is a new guild.  That's what I refer to as moving  laterally rather than forward.    I sent mails and tells to you earlier, you weren't idle, but ignoring me,  this isn't an indictment, it's an explanation of how I'm seeing things. With the manpower we have now on the wiz end, we should already be moving  forward, and it's not happening.  If it can't now, it never will.  I'm not interested in maintaining the status quo or going through this again.  I  want to work on code for the future, not to frustrate myself with going  through the same crap over and over, and looking like a fool while doing  so - I make myself look like a fool too many other ways.    I'll give this until at least Saturday, or Monday if there's improvement, but for now, I'm pretty much considering this the end of my time here as a wiz.  I have loved coding and bs'ing and playing here, but I need to   either be able to move forward, or move on.  The going around in circles just frustrates me, and that's no good for anyone. **mokri**Subj: mysql stuffDate: Oct 26 12:08hi.  there is already a minimal level of security with mysql. basically, i created a table 'valid_list'. when any call is made to the mysql functions, it checks that list. the path of the command or object making the call must be in that list, or the call will fail.  the only thing we should need to do is create a child table that checks permission levels. that is, instead of global 'pass/fail', we can give each file making a call permissions to certain tables/commands. so the mailer can do inserts and whatnot on the 'mail' table, but nothing else, blah blah blah.  i have some docs in ~mokri/docs/mysql that you should look over.  let me know if you have any questions  blah  -mokri **fakir**Subj: My IPCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,mizan,star,vital,earwaxDate: Nov  4 00:16My son, Michael has moved back home for  a time, and so will be logging into the game from my ip.

Once or twice happening is one thing, but if it's a repeated behavior it's another.  I'm sure you guys have noticed some new recent bickering and what not, I think it might have started with this teleportation issue some Rangers might have with others.  I just thought I would make a suggestion, which I have no idea if either of you would like to implement it or not.  With the teleport cmd to other Rangers, possibly having an accept or deny cmd.  Kind of the same idea as Shards Dragon's accepting or denying their rides.  I just thought I might throw an idea out there to try and help stop some of the new current bickering.  Thank you! Hope you guys have a great day!  Bella, The Plum Ranger **earwax**Subj: uhm, what's reasoning behind this...?Date: Nov  9 22:41Fri Nov 09 15:55:40 2007: vital       (RM) /log/FTP.log Fri Nov 09 15:57:40 2007: vital       (RM) /log/FTP.log Fri Nov 09 15:57:54 2007: vital       (RM) /log/FTP.log Fri Nov 09 15:59:02 2007: vital       (RM) /log/FTP.log Fri Nov 09 16:00:56 2007: vital       (RM) /log/FTP.log Fri Nov 09 16:01:12 2007: vital       (RM) /log/FILE_MOVE Fri Nov 09 16:14:04 2007: vital       (RM) /log/FTP.log  I assume there's a good reason, but mind sharing? :) **earwax** Re:   uhm, what's reasoning behind this...?Date: Nov 10 20:51not particularly fascist, it's just a particularly unusual sight in the log, no edits, but lots of rm's of the ftp log... **fred** Re:   Fred - I'm cosidering the following post for the Rangers.

The containing folders are /players/chip/room/apartment/ and /players/chip/mobs/apartment/. It's a simple area, based on your everyday inner city abandoned apartment building. If there's anything I must change before it is approved please let me know. Once it is finally approved and ready to be implemented, i'd like the entrance to be place at '/players/wren/Area/coastline/coast1.c' which is located all west, south, west from the village green. i was working on another area but it is much more complicated in the code and many times there's no one around to help me out with it, so i decided to accomplish something I could handle on my own in the meantime, and also gives the players a new place to check out although there's nothing special or hidden really in it. thanks for taking the time to look it all over, and I hope it's acceptable to be put into the game, at least after any needed changes. f Chipper **damani**Subj: WizardCc: (To: boltar) star,fred,mokri,vertebraker,vital,mizanDate: Jun  3 15:22I wish for one of my characters to become a wizard or if I may be allowed to make a character to be a wizard, I have a +100 character I beleive that quallifies me to ask for this opportunity.

The reason to use force() instead of just calling the function is so this_player() will be correct when attack() is called. Not sure what's causing the bug, specifically - probably the attacker object isn't getting properly passed to the weapon function.  This won't really be fixed until there's a better way of implementing additional attacks - something else I've been looking into but haven't done anything about yet. **rumplemintz**Subj: AFKCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,vital,angel,khrell,sparrow,star,mizanDate: Oct 28 12:23I'm switching jobs so I might be away from the game until I get settled.

The current server is a traditional Linux server running the CentOS 4.7 32 bit distribution. This is an 'end of life' product which has been superceded by the CentOS 5.x series.  What I am planning on doing is replacing the server with a newer machine that runs a hardware assist virtual machine environment. In English this means that the new machine will be hosting several virtual servers, one of which will be a dedicated machine just for Nirvana. These virtual machines run completely independent of one other. The changes will be imperceptible for most of you, but what is happening under the hood will be a major change. I am going to try migrating the OS to Ubuntu Server 9.10, 32 bit.  This will be a gradual process. First I need to move the server to the datacenter, the timeframe of which will be sometime in January.  Once the hardware is installed, the process of trying to move things over will start, and will be the 'slow-and-steady' parallel process.  I have zero intention of 'hot swapping' the old machine with the new without having anything tested. Things are subject to change but I will keep everyone posted.  Thanks, -tij **wulfgar**Subj: SparrowCc: (To: boltar) fred,vertebraker,mizan,vitalDate: Jan 23 21:39Hey anyone could you please add Sparrow's ip in please thanks **sparrow**Subj: Economy ProposalCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,vital,star,illarion,mizan,cloud, rumplemint, hardlyDate: Jan 27 00:47A doc that I wrote up suggesting methods for creating a real econmy for Nirvana is located at /players/sparrow/open/economy/economy.txt I'm not sure how you want to run this discussion on the matter,  through email, in thte same directory, mudmail? Enjoy' Sprrow **boltar** Re:   Economy ProposalCc: (To: sparrow) vertebraker,fred,vital,star,illarion,mizan,cloud, rumplemint, hardlyDate: Jan 31 19:01 It seems very complicated and difficult to implement. What bothers me  most is that it sort of forces people to be regular players or else. I feel a lot of people will choose to just go.    There has to be a more simple way of doing this besides a centralized system.  fixing the amount of coins in the system can cause a problem because other  goods, resources, etc in the game aren't fixed.   Rather than trying to create some complex system that doesn't break down  because money is fixed while goods aren't why not attempt a simple  system that keeps money from being created faster than other goods.   that's what I have for now.  **sparrow** Re:   Economy ProposalCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,vital,star,illarion,mizan,cloud, rumplemint, hardlyDate: Feb  2 10:47Woooo some discussion on the matter. SYPER difficult to implement. With the suggestions that I made goods are considered money. I might not have made that clear, when something would need to be cloned to the npc, it would have to be paid for out of the same pot as add_money. Yes it would be a total nightmare to implement. I would have to track down every item, re-value them all so that there is some sort of uniformity. Then locate every shop in the game, tie them into the economy. Standardize all of the heals.... yes headache. It would be a beautiful thing when complete, but that's the only way I could forsee a true economy.  Now I don't think I'm super clear on what you are asking, would you care to eloborate? Right now money is a minor inconvienence at most, and I do not understand what you mean by forcing people look look doh sorry about that to be regular players? It doesn't really force anything as far as I can see except an attempt to standardize values, costs, and give incentives for coining in different areas. Sparrow **boltar** Re:   Economy ProposalCc: (To: sparrow)  vertebraker,fred,vital,star,illarion,mizan,cloud, rumplemintzDate: Feb  2 21:23 With inflation it is the same manipulation as in real world fiat money.  Controlled inflation irl is designed to steal the value of people's savings forcing them into constant economic activity while also stealling the productivity gains of current work over yesterday's work.   Thus if a player isn't on frequently to keep up, he may login and  find he no longer has the funds to be viable and then simply decide  he doesn't want to put in the effort to rebuild. **sparrow** Re:   Economy ProposalCc: (To: boltar)  vertebraker,fred,vital,star,illarion,mizan,cloud, rumplemintzDate: Feb  2 21:28I know it is a long read but I offered two ways to deal  with players that are inactive for a long time.
