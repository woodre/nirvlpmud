System  I would like to implement a system for awarding players for various actions and milestones.  Following are what they'd earn points for:  Questing:     1 per quest point Xlevels:      1 per PK:           1 per 5 pk points Noob Helper:  Upon reviewing, strict standards for noob helper behavior Bug Reps:     1-10 per, based on exploitability, severity, etc Ideas:        1-10 per, based on implementation, creativity, etc Typos:        1 per Party Points: 1/500k gained in a party of more than one player Contests:     1-20 points depending on placement, etc Donation:     5 points per rl dollar donated to mud Playtesting:  1-10 Coding:       I'm sure we can work something out here Solid beta:   Depends on the job they do, perhaps up to 20 points Age:          1 pt for day of game-age Voting:       Requires some way of proving it, but 1-2 points per time   Rewards:  'Essence of Nirvana' - not strictly an armor, anyone can use, but has the functionality of armor, in some ways. Dtype prots:  10 points per point of protection, max of 20 per dtype Nightvision 100 points Invisibility 100 points Word of recall-type spell, once per reboot (or login?) 100 points Alignment adjustment - can toggle good/evil/neutral, 50 points per rate   of adjustment level....ie, low/medium/high rate cash pocket - allows you to carry an extra 20k - 100 points spam/nospam settings as well  Nirvana Sword starts at a certain wc, then can raise it for 50 points/wc point weight starts at perhaps weight 3, can lower it 2 for 50 points each twohanded option - 100 points additional damage - can choose physical or a dtype, 50 points per level,   low/medium/high speed - possibility of extra attacks?  or appearance of them....prolly 150 Deathblow - 50 points, but trains up over time once bought Defense - can add minor defensive help, 50-100 points? Unbreakable - 50 or 100 points I'd like this weapon to be a 'trainable' weapon, meaning you put points  into it, but you also have to use it, so over time you become better and better with it. **earwax**Subj: attrib stuff, lemme know what you thinkCc: hadusDate: Apr 16 18:58Attributes:  The following are the attributes we'll be switching to, as eventually were hashed out by a buttload of wizzes.  Anyways as players gain a level they gain perhaps 5 attrib points to distribute as they wish, perhaps a random stat will raise automatically each level.  Max for each stat will be 30, to conform with current standards; each race however, will have different maxes for each stat, with 30 being the ceiling.  Stats will be more in control of a char's power than level, but they gain stats through levels and xlevels.  Currently I don't have anything planned for gaining stats in any way other than level, although that may change.  strength:     damage bonuses in combat, carry capacity dexterity:    chance to hit in combat, dodge, parry, skills etc constitution: hp, hpr (regen rate), endurance points, epr willpower:    innate resistances, willpower type checks, has an effect on ep mental:       sp/spr, int/wis checks  racial, static stats: they either don't change, or aren't controlled by char: luck:      they can 'roll' this stat at char generation charisma:  also roll this at char generation, within limits set by race size:      this will go up as they level, until they reach their max size            also a rolled stat  Specifics:  HP: 10* con + 2*level + 2*xlevel      7  con at level 1  means 72  max hp - higher than now     30 con at level 19 means 338 max hp - about equivalent to now  SP: 10* men + 3*level + 3*xlevel      7  men at level 1  = 73      30 men at level 19 = 357   EP: 7*con + 3*wil + 2*level + 2*xlevel  HPR: racial modifier + con hp regen per minute, max of 60 SPR: racial modifier + men sp regen per minute EPR: racial modifier + 2/3 con + 1/3 wil  current stat checks will be routed to the most appropriate stat  Implementation: these won't go fully into the game for general players until this stuff has been thoroughly tested and races, gear changes, skills are ready to go in as well, but they will be the first in for testing. **whitehawk**Subj: NecromancersCc: (To: hoyle) sephirothDate: Nov 16 14:10was wondering what your opinion of necromancers were I noticed Coglin was partying with one Ive always thought them crafty and not really trustworthy I tried casually brought it up in guild chat, got no response. personally Id party with a fellow ranger myself but it seems most rangers just aint what they used to be they become +100 and they seem to think they can do whatever they please, was wondering if thats the way it seemed to you too   just my two cents **ziggler**Subj: Joining RangersDate: Mar  7 11:26Hello, I was referred over to you by Skarekrow.  He said you could  help me join the rangers.  I have a lot of xp saved up and maxed stats for my level.  Could you assist me in joining?  Ziggler **sephiroth** Re:   Joining RangersCc: (To: ziggler) sephiroth,skarekrowDate: Mar 10 09:11Ah, yes, ole Skare. He's a hell of a Ranger, and a decent guy (when he's not pissed off, heh). I can in fact bring you into the Rangers and get you started. The only thing i ask, is to finish getting your stealth to 20 (yours is currently 8 and it helps as a ranger), and get int, wil, pie, and cha to 10 each (stat costs for those lower points are minimal), and to get to a total of 1,090,000 saved experience points, yours is currently just under 657K. I don't say that to be picky, or to be an ass  nor do I say it to make it harder on you. Having that much or more exp saved to start off with as a Ranger will make being a fresh ranger MUCH easier, especially when no one is around to help you out. The less experience you have to start off with as a new Ranger, the harder it will be to do anything. New Rangers I've seen who started with no saved up experience, always ended up quitting playing the character, or the mud completely, as it was just way too hard. Skarekrow, me, Deathseeker, or m ost other rangers should have no problems helping you get the other 440K or so experience you need to get a good start. Just let them know I requested that they lend their aide in getting you there, unless i see you on to get you it myself. Skarekrow can contact me anytime outside the mud, so let him know when you've finally got it done and i'll be on the first chance i get to get you started. I look forward to seeing a new face in the guild! Talk to you again soon hopefully! Best of luck! Sephi **ziggler**Subj: Joining RangersDate: Mar 11 10:20thanks for the reply.  I am going to attempt to get the xp and stats today.  I will get back to you as soon as ive completed it **"
