messages "blysse** Re:   My loveDate: Aug 14 22:19My sweet love, It gladdens my heart to have word from you.  I know you are not away by choice, but knowing that does not make the long nights fly by any faster or ease the lonely ache in my heart.  I have so much to tell you, so much to share, but I cannot begin to do it justice in a short letter.  I want nothing more in the world than to have you home, to hold you and know that you are safe, to touch you and love you and know that your face will be the first I see as the morning sun kisses my skin.  Pray, tell me you will return soon.  Until then, I remain Your Blysse **blysse**Subj: Missing youDate: Sep  2 22:07My dearest Marek, I was told that you were on your way home to me, and I cannot contain my joy!  It has been far too long since I last held you, last tasted your kiss, last heard your laughter....a lifetime.  Should this letter find you before you have arrived, pray, make haste.  The  warmest of welcomes awaits you, and a prayer that you will not have need to go abroad again.  Until then, I remain Your Devoted Blysse **blysse**Subj: Missing you...Date: Dec 27 23:27My dearest Marek, I write in the hope that my letter will find you on your long journey.  All is well here, but I miss you terribly. I long for the day when you return home to me. Until then, stay safe, and know that my heart follows wherever you may go. Ever yours, Blysse **blysse**Subj: RelievedDate: Jan 13 20:28My dearest Marek, I received word that you are well, and have  returned to the area.  I am overjoyed to find you well! You are ever in my thoughts, and I hope to see you soon.  Until then, I remain Your Blysse *** **dragnar**Subj: wc bonus inCc: **Date: Sep 24 17:54No messages but the bonus is in. **"
