Obviously, this is something that you as a player shouldn't get your eyes on, but I'm still hoping you decide to become a wizard and get involved with this shit.  Anyways, don't let anyone know you received it, but give it a perusal and let me know what you think.  -Earwax **earwax**Subj: Proposal for Armor: AC, Weight and Slot StandardsDate: Oct  9 02:59Type     Weight  AC Range  Body AC   Shield Light:     1        0          1     None Medium:   1-2       1         2-3    Buckler: 1-2 Heavy:     2+       2         4-6    Shield:  2-4  Light would be basically clothing, only real effects would be magical in   origin.  Some could supply AC, where thematic; case-by-case basis.  Medium would be for thief/finess fighter types.  This would be the type of   armor most beneficial for the future dodge/parry skills.  Heavy would of course be actual armor.  Platemail, chainmail, etc would fall   into this category.  AC should definitely reflect weight.  Physical Protection  Slot     Types                        AC (L/M/H)    Weight (L/M/H) Head:    Hats/Headbands/Masks/Helms    0  /1-2/2      1  /1-2/2+ Neck:    Leather Collar/Gorget         ---/1  /2      ---/1  /1-2 Body:    Body Armor                    1-2/2-3/4-6    1-2/2-3/4+ Arms:    Bracelet/Armbands/Bracers     0  /1-2/2      1  /1-2/2+ Legs:    Pants/Leggings                0  /1-2/2      1  /1-2/2+ Hands:   Gloves/Gauntlets              0  /1-2/2      1  /1-2/2+ Feet:    Shoes/Boots                   0  /1-2/2      1  /1-2/2+ Shield:  Buckler/Medium/Heavy/Tower    ---/1-2/3-4    ---/1-2/2+ Cloak:   Would have to be thematic, but maybe AC 1-2 for heavy cloak type  Magical Gear/Accessories Necklace/Amulet (Neck class, since otherwise it'd be collar/gorget) Rings (2)       (Disallow rings if gauntlets/gloves used?) Earring?        (Disallow if helms are used?) Belt            (Come on, these aren't physical protection) Misc/I guess Teddy could go here, compete with other miscs  I'd also like to see multiple slots be added in, could be fairly easily  implemented, I'll prolly slap a code snippet for it together.  Basically it'd be similar to multiple properties in rooms.  This would be very easy to do, really.  Switching stuff to these standards based on their current weight/ac values would be very easy as well.  If they are ac 2, their weight will be 2.  New stuff will use the new functions, if it uses the old funs  then it automatically gets adjusted on load.  I really don't wanna explain further, but it'd still require a lot of adjusting by hand.  Anyways, let me know what you guys think.  This is far from an end product, but it's somewhere to start, and I think it's pretty much what we should go with in the end.  Between us we should be able to hash out a pretty good system.  -Earwaximus **earwax**Subj: Another one to keep quiet about but lemme know your opinions onDate: Oct  9 04:28I'm proposing a skills system to go in for both nonguilded characters and guilds to use.  There are a few reasons for this kind of system, including (and of course not limited to): guilds to be thematic additions rather than requirements for chars to be feasible; a standardized system lessening the need for complex combat code in guilds, allowing the coding wizzes to focus more on content/theme than combat stuff; standardizing simply gives us a better system to work from, more consistent from guild to guild, while not losing variety - we should gain variety since simply changing a few tricks and spell names won't cut it anymore; this kind of system will be extremely addicting for new players as they will SEE their characters improving  dramatically right from the time they start playing - seeing your skills going up over and over is very addicting, trust me, it's the key to any success DragonHeart MUD has enjoyed, and was part of the appeal to Mal's Warrior guild.  Another advantage to this is that it rewards players for actually killing stuff rather than hitting behind someone, as the majority won't trigger unless the player is taking hits; yet another advantage of this system is that it opens up a variety of ways to play even a guildless character ("Adventurer's Guild?") - they can wear medium armor and focus more on dodging/parrying attacks and using counterattack, or they can wear the heavy gear and use shields for shield block/bash.  The skills will be reliant both on attributes (which will be undergoing a revision as well, to make them more important, and less uniform from char to char), and usage-based raising.  There will be two basic categories: automatic, and initiated; automatic being skills that the game attempts to use automatically, and initiated being ones that the player has to type a command to use.  They will be on a percentage basis as well, with 5% being probably the minimum.    Skills (of both varieties) will be raised automatically, in a manner similar to Maledicta's Warriors, or more closely, to the system in place on  DragonHeart MUD.  The skills will have a % chance to happen, and when they happen, a % chance to improve: higher chance at lower skill levels, low at the higher end.    Skills will also have prerequisites.  For example, riposte (counterattack) requires parrying a blow.  Because of that, the powerful counterattack  ability will take much longer to max than the parry ability.  There will be advanced skills as well - for example, enhanced dodge, which requires the regular dodge skill to be maxxed.  Sorry for the spammage, but there was a lot to cover.  Keep in mind that this is the absolute first draft, it requires a lot of fleshing out in  order to code, as well as having the attribute and race revisions already in place.  As much input as possible is critical in designing this sytem, so please, formulate some opinions and mail them to me, either on here, or to dhalek@comcast.net.  Thanks.  -Earwax **earwax**Subj: last one:Date: Oct  9 04:45Defense:   General:     Dodge     Parry     Drunken Fighting (increased ability while intoxicated)        Unarmed:     Unarmed Dodge (req: dodge)     Unarmed Parry    Armed:     Armed Dodge (req: dodge)     Armed Parry (req: Parry)     Shield Block  Offense:   General:     Finish (deathblow, messages patterned off MK fatalities?)     Riposte (requires a successful parry)     Negate Armor/Study (enhanced odds of hitting through AC)     Drunken Style?        Unarmed:     Unarmed Attack (increased odds of hitting opponent)     Unarmed Riposte (instead of general riposte?)     Advanced Unarmed (req: attack, multi-hits/round, better odds)    Armed:     Armed Attack     Shield Bash (req successful shield block? or builds off it?)     Advanced Armed Attack (req armed attack, mebbe xtra attacks)     Offwield (50% damage in offwield)     Two-Hander Tactics     Perhaps specialization in each weapon type (sword, polearm, etc)  General/Magic:   First Aid (heal)   Castle Spell   Consider   Offer   Examine (prots/dtypes on gear)   Sharpen Weapon   Repair Weapon   Repair Armor   Analyze Opponent (find out rough dtype prots/ac/etc on opponent)   Combat spells (mi,sh,fi,so)   Invisibility   Call Imp/Demon Merchant (I'd really like to see this in core abilities) **vertebraker**Subj: email addressesCc: (To: earwax) subotai,linus,jatar,jaraxle,mosobpDate: Oct 11 06:17except Earwax,  I need a valid email address for all of you. Design messages will typically be sent by email to accomodate all your schedules via a Google Group. I've set one up, now I just need your guys' email addresses to add you to the list. **sephiroth**Subj: Gone for a whileCc: (To: earwax) demonic,jamila,redroses,worm,hedren,lexi,jatar,cooper,vertebraker,sparkle,pestilence,alexa,volkar,sticks,fredDate: Dec  1 10:18Hey y'all.
