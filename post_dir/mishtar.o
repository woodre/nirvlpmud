I did put several of my chars inactive, but thatwas more because i have no interest in playing them right now than anything else.I have been stressed out lately, and that is my fault, i let school get to meand i have allowed some personal issues here to bug me.I'm really not sure what else to say, except that i hope you have a safe andenjoyable trip.ME!**vertebraker**Subj: ...Cc: (To: fakir) hogath,humble,martha,lexi,sparkle,mishtar,jaryn,novowels,syn,trent,jaryn,mosobp,data,dakeyras,plasma,wrathchild,jackDate: May 13 00:20Ok, you guys haven't created anything since you werewized. Regardless of what you've done [or plan to do]we ask now that you create your first area in the nextthree (3) months. No exceptions. This is passed downfrom the highest levels in Nirvana's administration,which means that you will be dewized if you do notdo as we ask. With the recent flush of new wizards,it is imperative that we weed the real serious wizardsout from the pack. If you are already working on yourfirst area, then consider this a happy little note tocontinue your progress.Note: If you are dewized, you may of course requestwizardhood once again from any seniors. But know thatwe will remember your failure here.Sincerely, Vertebraker**earwax**Subj: the silent movement item checkerCc: (To: mizan) mishtarDate: May 16 02:54/open/earwax/checker.clemme know when you got it so i can rm it.I don't really care about it being there too much, but why have itthat obvious? :)**vertebraker**Subj: emotesDate: May 22 00:02Uh, you can do as many emotes as you want.OR, revise the old ones.Heh:)Let me know if you want to do it!**mac**Subj: heyaDate: May 28 01:53i miss ya.how have ya been?smbdykwl@hotmail.com\/\/ () R /\/\ l;pves yaloves too!**hogath**Subj: helloCc: sharDate: Jun 28 00:26Hey there, hope this finds you doing well.
