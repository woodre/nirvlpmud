Regardless of what you've done [or plan to do]we ask now that you create your first area in the nextthree (3) months. No exceptions. This is passed downfrom the highest levels in Nirvana's administration,which means that you will be dewized if you do notdo as we ask. With the recent flush of new wizards,it is imperative that we weed the real serious wizardsout from the pack. If you are already working on yourfirst area, then consider this a happy little note tocontinue your progress.Note: If you are dewized, you may of course requestwizardhood once again from any seniors. But know thatwe will remember your failure here.Sincerely, Vertebraker**vital**Subj: Coding and DevelopmentCc: vertebraker,fred,forbin,francesco,vital,boltarDate: Sep  7 18:20Lexi, As you no doubt have noticed, you levels have been reduced to where you were when you were first approved for a position on the Nirvana development team. This was an administrative decision and not one reflecting any cheating or poor behavior on your part.  Your files are intact and backed up. If you desire to actually contribute to the development and improvement of Nirvana, you will need to seek out and discuss this with the senior wizards who will evaluate your readiness and willingness to contribute to the game.  Some people just enjoy being a player more and actually feel more comfortable doing that, rather than being a developer. Thanks, Vital **sephiroth**Subj: Gone for a whileCc: (To: earwax) demonic,jamila,redroses,worm,hedren,lexi,jatar,cooper,vertebraker,sparkle,pestilence,alexa,volkar,sticks,fredDate: Dec  1 10:18Hey y'all. I'm letting everyone know that I actually feel I need to let know, that I will be gone for quite some time. Alot of rl things have come up that are just much more important to me than this place could ever be. But I will make my return at some point in the future to reak(sp) havok and cause loads of trouble again. Gonna miss you guys. See ya hopefully when i come back. Seph/Grog/Shenji/Kyllur **"
