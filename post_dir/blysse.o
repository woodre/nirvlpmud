I hope this note finds you safe, until we meet again.  Humbly yours,   Marek **marek**Subj: sorryDate: Aug  2 20:44My lady,  I'm sorry for having to leave yet once again, but business calls, and when it does, I must answer. I enjoyed our time, as brief as it was, and I shall look to the night sky, knowing you are looking at it too, and wishing you were here.  Yours,  Marek **marek**Subj: I hate subject linesDate: Aug 15 04:08My dearest Blysse,  I just returned home from a quest in the far outer reaches of this realm and wanted to write you the first chance I got.  How was your day? How are your studies coming? I was trying out a new horse today, and got bucked off, it's ok the only thing bruised was my ego. *smirk*. At any rate, I wanted to see how you are, and let you know that you are in my thoughts constantly.  I look forward to seeing you soon.  Yours, Marek **marek**Subj: YoursDate: Aug 24 03:26My dearest Blysse, I hope this letter finds you well, I have stopped off in a small village in the outer reaches of the realm. I have entrusted this letter to a bard whom I met on my travels here. All is well with me, how are you doing? It seems forever since I held you in my arms, I look forward to doing so when I return. I hope Knights business doesn't keep me away much further, being away from you driving me mad!  How is your studies going? Do you have any stories for me? I hope to hear from you soon.  Yours, forever, Marek **marek**Subj: my dearestCc: alexisDate: Oct 10 17:36My dearest blysse, The nights are cold, and days are rainy and dreary since I last held you in my arms.
