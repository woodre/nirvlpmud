Instead, they can provide special  abilities, protection values outside of ac, damage specials, etc -armor to be classified by its weight/ac ratio with the following categories:  Body Armor:    Categorization           AC  Weight    clothing/nonprotective -  0    1    light                  -  1    2    medium                 - 2-3  2-6    heavy                  - 4-6  4-8   Shields:    nonprotective          -  NA   NA    light                  -   1   1    medium                 -  2-3  2-3    heavy                  -  3-4  3-6   Head/Arms/Hands/Legs/Boots:    nonprotective          -   0   1    light                  -   1   1    medium                 -  1-2  2    heavy                  -  2-3 2-3 **earwax**Subj: Worn gear proposal part 2Cc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,fakir,forbin,stardream,pavlikDate: Mar 29 02:28 -Max ac items will not carry specials except in extreme circumstances, which  should fit the following criteria: rarity (no more than 1/3 chance of being  cloned), extremely dangerous mob, probably in a PK area, and being limited in  some manner as to levels or who can wear it. -Legacy gear will be automatically adjusted, due to absence of a flag to be  set in future armors, to appropriate weight based on the ac, type, and if it  has a special or not. -Armor will set a restriction level in living.c, which guilds can query, so   they can set appropriate penalties for using heavier gear than they allow. -The range of carry capacity will be adjusted - lower chars having far more  capacity than they currently have.  Strength will account for much, but a   total noob (level 1, str 10) will be able to carry reasonable gear. -The accessory items will have 0 ac in ALL cases.  Specific adjustments can be  made for special items like the e-gear, etc.  In those cases, it will be   magical protection, meaning based on specials and dtype (physical allowed)  protections.  AC will mean armor class though, and nothing that isn't armor  will have Ac. -We should implement better item statting.  I'm 100% in favor of allowing   players to have full stats (minus special information) on gear.  See below. -Randomization to some extent of gear stats.  In other words, something that  grants 10% magical protection should actually grant 5% +- random(5).  This  will make the best stuff more unique, and in combination with allowing the  players full statistical knowledge, will help us create an actual economy. -An auction system.  Taking advantage of the above steps, combined with the  forced diversity that this system will foster - between guild reqs, armor  restriction/encumbrance levels/randomness/knowledge - will foster major   progress in moving toward a cap-less and full economy. -Gear-induced stat modifiers.  This will go more hand-in-hand with possible  future races and stat changes.  Not as important right now, but it should be  kept in mind. -Narrower range of item values.  Shit worth 200k is foolish. **pavlik**Subj: statsCc: (To: earwax) pavlik,boltar,fred,vertebrakerDate: Mar 29 10:31>We should implement better item statting.  I'm 100% in favor of allowing >players to have full stats (minus special information) on gear.  I agree, but not really.  Statting should be available through special resources, such as an NPC that will take coins to 'identify' an item (and some NPCs may be better at accurately statting an item than others).  Guilds could also have abilities to stat items, but it should remain within the theme of their guild ... for examlpe a Cyberninja could stat the AC/WC of an item but not it's magic properties - and vice versa for a Mage (or other magic based guild).  --pav **earwax**Subj: Attribute stuffCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 16 18:56Attributes:  The following are the attributes we'll be switching to, as eventually were hashed out by a buttload of wizzes.  Anyways as players gain a level they gain perhaps 5 attrib points to distribute as they wish, perhaps a random stat will raise automatically each level.  Max for each stat will be 30, to conform with current standards; each race however, will have different maxes for each stat, with 30 being the ceiling.  Stats will be more in control of a char's power than level, but they gain stats through levels and xlevels.  Currently I don't have anything planned for gaining stats in any way other than level, although that may change.  strength:     damage bonuses in combat, carry capacity dexterity:    chance to hit in combat, dodge, parry, skills etc constitution: hp, hpr (regen rate), endurance points, epr willpower:    innate resistances, willpower type checks, has an effect on ep mental:       sp/spr, int/wis checks  racial, static stats: they either don't change, or aren't controlled by char: luck:      they can 'roll' this stat at char generation charisma:  also roll this at char generation, within limits set by race size:      this will go up as they level, until they reach their max size            also a rolled stat  Specifics:  HP: 10* con + 2*level + 2*xlevel      7  con at level 1  means 72  max hp - higher than now     30 con at level 19 means 338 max hp - about equivalent to now  SP: 10* men + 3*level + 3*xlevel      7  men at level 1  = 73      30 men at level 19 = 357   EP: 7*con + 3*wil + 2*level + 2*xlevel  HPR: racial modifier + con hp regen per minute, max of 60 SPR: racial modifier + men sp regen per minute EPR: racial modifier + 2/3 con + 1/3 wil  current stat checks will be routed to the most appropriate stat  Implementation: these won't go fully into the game for general players until this stuff has been thoroughly tested and races, gear changes, skills are ready to go in as well, but they will be the first in for testing. **fakir**Subj: changesCc: (To: vertebraker) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 17 21:18I may not be on track here, but I find myself wondering how the current proposed changes (which are many and fairly complicated) will be introduced into a game that has, for the most part, had its parameters in place for a good long time.  We have players (at least a few still) who will be confused....or feel 'out of it'.  If the game is going to be changed to a large extent, would it not be better to make an 'alt' mud, change it up, and then let people log in and try it out?  I also wonder how in the world the mud will support races, guilds, clans, etc....when we have barely enough ppl playing to make the mud viable as it is.  I am not trying to be negative here...just wondering if all this 'patch work' on Nirvana is for its overall good...or if it will alienate more players.  We have already lost some decent players due to changes...just something to think about.  Again, I am not trying to rain on a parade, just wonder how it all meshes together and works out. * * **earwax**Subj: initial race guidelinesCc: (To: vertebraker) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 19 08:30Race Guidelines  Players have the following attributes:  Strength Constitution Dexterity Willpower Intelligence  They have the following racial attributes: Luck Charisma Size  They also have the following racial modifiers to their regen rates: Racial HPR Racial SPR Racial EPR  When creating a race you should consider as a starting point 120 total attrib points for the main 5, with luck and charisma being 20.  No stat should be above 35, and never should a race have 2 stats at 35.  If charisma or luck are raised or lowered you should subtract/add half that amount to the base  attribute pool.  When putting points into stat maxes, you should consider the following:  35: Extremely high 30: Very high 25: High 20: Normal 15: Low 10: Very Low 5:  Extremely low  Racial regeneration rates should be thematic for the race, and stats should be balanced accordingly.  In other words, if you grant high regeneration rates to a race, the overall stats should be lower.  Another aspect to consider is innate resistance levels to dtypes, special  abilities, nightvision, innate disadvantages, etc.  Everything that goes into a race should be considered balance-wise versus the other races.  Ideally, we will have no one dominant race.  Every player can decide whether they would rather have innate resistances, high stats, high regen rates, or whatever.  Also keep in mind that this is purely an initial 'guess' as to how races  should be balanced.  Once we have figured out some races a better system can be devised. **pavlik**Subj: mage spellCc: (To: earwax) pavlikDate: Apr 19 09:04want to have you test for approval a mage spell we talked about the other day :  "minor invulnrability" - this spell will shadow the player and stop 90% of *physical* damage at the cost of 1 spell point per point of damage.  the 10% damage that is passed to the player is changed from type "physical" to type "other|pavlik" so that their AC does not reduce the 10%  for example: a call of do_damage(10, "physical") would be converted to do_damage(1, "other|pavlik") and 9 spell points would be deducted from the player.  the spell would have an initial start up cost (50 sp?) and would expire after X amount of time or when the players spell points drop below zero.  thoughts?  i have coded the shell of this and can make it available to your test char if you want to test it out...  -pav **pavlik**Subj: mages guildCc: (To: earwax) fred,pavlikDate: Apr 27 09:39My target date to open the Mages guild to the public is May 17th.  I will be traveling in early May and will not be online much at all, therefor my preference to wait until the 17th.

I had talked to Symbio about the whole Amiro thing before Forbin jailed them both.  I knew Amiro was Symbio's  alt character and he freely admitted it to me and said that he gave the char away to Sunim.  I first questioned him because I thought he was multiplaying (using both chars).  After he told me that he had given the character away I informed him that well that was also illegal.  He said he wasn't aware of that and asked if I could let it slide this once.  After some thought I told him that I would let it go for "now" and that if too many people had a problem with it that something would have to be done about it.  I wasn't sure how many people actually knew that Symbio was Amiro and lets face it it wouldn't take long to party someone up to lvl 19 so I thought that if players didn't scream about it and it got two established mudders here to start playing again I was willing to let give it a try.  But like I mentioned earlier I did inform him that if it did cause problems it would have to be addressed.  Fred **stardream**Subj: symbio/amiroCc: (To: fred) vertebraker,earwax,illarion,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlikDate: Apr 29 15:26I already received a player complaint from worm about it, I dunno if that counts or not heh SD **stardream**Subj: symbio/amiroCc: (To: forbin) earwax,fakir,pavlik,fred,vertebraker,illarion,francescoDate: Apr 30 14:17After giving this matter some thought, I am inclined to feel that Forbin is right about the whole situation.  I think that it has been a long standing rule that people cannot character share.  If Sunim wants to create another character then he should do that, rather than taking one  from someone else.  Players have been jailed in the past for this, and as Worm of all people pointed out, this has always been our policy.  Worm has been jailed before for giving his characters away, and I feel its unfair to all of those players who have also been  told they cannot share characters with another person for us to make an exception for Symbio who has a tendency to try to work the system when it suits his needs.  I highly doubt he didn't know that he couldn't give away his characters, as he was friends with Worm when Worm was jailed for it.   Anyways, if it doesn't take that long to get to level 19, then there's no real reason to share that character anyways because its only a matter of a little time before sunim could level his own characters up to that level why make an exception just because they are established mudders, if anything, I'd think you'd want to make an  exception for a player giving the character to a non-established player, who needs the help more.   Anyways, that's just what I think, ultimately I'll leave the decision up to Fred or Earwax or Verte to decide.   oh, and just one more thing, like Forbin asked, next time if you think about it, please let someone know when an  exception like this is being made so that we don't  gripe at players over something that's already been settled Thanks, SD **earwax** Re:   why is oz deguilded?Cc: (To: vertebraker) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: May  2 23:02He's a moron.  He's been causing nothing but issues, I've personally seen him flapping and instigating and antagonizing over and over,  he's had a long history of this crap.  I sat him down before and gave him a very explicit warning.  In no uncertain terms I informed him that if there was a future problem with him I would take action, at the very least, resulting in his removal from the guild.  Then I come to find out, between talking to Salina, Squint, and Mosh, and reading the log that Salina conveniently had, that he's getting stupid again. Further, recently he was flapping at other chars while I was on, including myself.  I didn't take action at the time, figured bah,  whatever, this is minor stuff.  Then I read the logs for knights and see him criminaling mosh multiple times, see him lying in at least one instance in the criminal logs, from a few months ago, and see him giving himself awards as well.

I don't see any interference between Earwax and Salina living together as you suggested, since there were multiple issues involved. If anything, all that did was speed communication to bring it to Earwax's attention. Otherwise he would have taken the same action, and I probably would have done the same. The administration is sick of you not roleplaying a roleplaying guild, specifically because you were in such a major role in the guild. Instead of being a leader, you decided to be a rogue or whatever. It doesn't really matter. Anyway, you can talk to Earwax if you don't like the decision or bring it up to Boltar, although he's likely just to agree with us considering there is tangible evidence that myself and others have already reviewed. In regards to equipment in your templar room that you wish to claim, that's up to Earwax's discretion. **vertebraker**Subj: yoCc: (To: earwax) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: May  8 21:52i'm moving and i'm turning in my cable modem tomorrow. so, i'll be back sometime in the next couple weeks. i'm going to be working on the rewards stuff offline.  tom **salina**Subj: Ok, so to do a little bit of advertising, I made a nirvana myspace site.

The instances will be logged to /log/OBJECT_VIOLATIONS Take those entries with a grain of salt, it's very easy to eventually end up (within a reboot) with gear from an alt char, at times, but this is a tool for tracking repeat violations and extreme ones. It replaces mizan's object tracking, which was extremely resource- heavy, and very limited, through no fault of his, merely the lack of opportunity to implement it on the lib-level.  -Earwax **vertebraker**Subj: i'm back,Cc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Jul  6 08:21i'm back, thanks.  tom **earwax**Subj: violations log for gear passingCc: (To: stardream) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Jul 11 00:32/log/OBJECT_VIOLATIONS - they are now part of the lib and will trigger  for ALL characters passing gear to chars from their own ip - also  note that they receive a message upon receipt of gear from another char, something to the effect of 'Logging gear passing between chars' This is intended to eliminate this type of action as much as possible, and make it so they can't say 'i didn't know' ... if there are patterns emerging, well, hey, it's not like they didn't know.  Please check this log - mail me or edit /log/OBJECT_VIOLATIONS at the entry in order to indicate that entries have been acted upon,  -ew **earwax**Subj: wlog changeCc: (To: vertebraker) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Jul 20 15:10wlog has been changed to now add all entries to /log/WR/WORK_REPORT as well as individual wizard work reps, typing 'wlog' without an arg  will show both your own log and the central log.

If you wish to know what I am talking about, read some of the mails he has sent me.  Personally, I like the mud the way it is. I don't want to change it. I have no intention of dancing to some tune Earwax feels like playing on his flute. I do not, nor never have abused wizard powers. I occasionally snoop a player, but never when two players are in a room or chatting. And, I usually (almost always) tell a player if and when I am snooping them and also when I turn snoop off.  Its absurd that Earwax even brings that into a conversation about being a wizard.   Personally Boltar, I am sick and tired of his heavy handed way of dealing with things...and it's my opinion you are going to have a dead mud very soon because of it.  I will not tolerate someone who threatens, cajoles, and is otherwise a dick.   It is true I do not contribute to the mud much, other than the areas I did code and are in play.  However, I have never seen my contribution here to be one of code.  Wizards come and go...power hungry, unstable wizards have come and gone.  In almost every case where there has been an abuse of power, or a lack of good judgement, I have had a hand in resolving that issue...in some way or another.  And, I might add, you have usually backed me up in most of the disputes I have had some involvement in.  I don't really care what Earwax does. I do not have the juice, nor the time, nor really the interest anymore to try and corral his over-bloated ego...I suspect that issue, if its dealt with, will have to rest with you. apply sphere to being a wizard here...I've had a good run. I have enjoyed the game, and enjoyed for the most part the people I have met here.  If the current gestapo Earwax does indeed have his way and dewizes me, so be it.  Even though he feels otherwise, I still think I contribute something to the game...but as always, I will leave that up to you to decide. I am way too old and way to long in the tooth here to care much what some bully wizard dictates to me as being 'his way or the highway'.  Do you really want someone like this in charge of things to the point you give him THAT much authority?  Vert NEVER had an ego like Earwax. He NEVER abused any wizard power. He never, once he became a wizard, cheated the game. I cannot say the same for Earwax.  There is a WORLD of difference between Vertebraker and Earwax as far as Admin goes.  Personally, if Earwax is in charge, I don't want to be a wizard here. * **fakir**Subj: dewizzingCc: (To: earwax) boltar,vertebraker,fred,illarion,francesco,forbin,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Oct  7 19:33You do what you wish...or rather...whatever B lets you get away with.  Personally, I'd bump you back to a level more fitting of your mental capacity and temperament, but unfortunately, we don't have wizards in the negative level category.  If you continue to travel the path you are currently walking, you will have a very dead mud.  I can almost guarantee it.  Further, I don't give a SHIT what you think, want, or do.  I lost all respect for you as a wizard when I caught you cheating with triggers.  You should have been de-wizzed then, and you should not be a wizard in charge of diddly shit now.  You have neither the skill nor ability to manage people...your ego is far to large a barrier for you to even see over, let alone allow you to manage others in a civil and appropriate manner.  Someday, when you grow up, and really learn what real life is all about, you will look back on this letter and chuckle.  I will no doubt be long gone by then, however.  Have a good life, and good luck riding herd over the bunch of twelve year old players your going to foster here...its right up your alley. f **chip** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 04:07really? you don't snoop players chatting? then it's so funny how you knew the things my templar said to Earwax about a matter dealing with your templar who was on at the time, you drunk egotistical worthless fucking jackass. I think wax's ideas are going to be a huge improvement for the mud and will bring a much larger Pbase. only people who may find him a dick are the abusers/grievers/cheaters. so which category shall you place yourself in? take a pick, heh. no one needs to hear your whining when you're never even around to give any of it solid structure. find something better to do than bitch about things you're not even getting yourself involved in. if you don't like how things are, don't bitch. change em. which means come here more regularly. i've not found thing one wrong with the projects Earwax has proposed and begun. and i'm quite sure in my own mind, being a long time player myself, that this mud needs an admin like Earwax to weed out the weak and the whining. and if you're so heartbroken that the  mud will be doing so well here in the very near future just because you won't be involved to get recognition for it, then maybe you should be dewizzed. i personally will not be expecting recognition, for i'm not able to be involved due to heavy hitting life circumstances. tho, I'm not bitching either, because the place i have called home for over 10 years will continue to be home and a nice one at that. i just wish we could get more wizzes like Wax, Verte, Bolts and Fred around here. and as soon as humanly possible, i'm hoping to learn tons from all 4, Wax especially. Chip - Apprentice Developer (learning) **earwax** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) boltar,vertebraker,fred,illarion,francesco,forbin,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Oct  8 06:24Let's see.  Whatever I'm allowed to get away with.  Personally I'd rather not make decisions, I'd rather just code, that's what I'm good at and what I enjoy.  Babysitting a bunch of grown adults does nothing but irritate me and make me less productive.  I like to figure out  problems and code solutions to them.  This is my enjoyment, and it's the surrogate challenge for me, since the game is simply too easy as a player.  Now, the shit with the triggers, you yourself said and know that it wasn't like it was beneficial to me.  I was dealing with  exhaustion pure and simple.  But that's beside the point, I did what I did, but it still pales in comparison to your own abuses.  I made a mistake, you made repeated mistakes, and more than that, you haven't done anything positive for the game in years, and you have worked hard to be negative.  You bitch, but offer no solutions nor put forth any work.  The work I've done in one single object alone is more than your sum total of code in this game, ever, not to mention the simple fact that it's years beyond your comprehension or POTENTIAL level of  improvement.    If we want to get into specifics, I've done my best, other wizards have as well, to get you involved with improvements in the game.  Instead,  you're content with a slow death over the years, a slow reduction in playerbase each year, until this mud dies, whereas I'm doing everything I can to get as much influence from players and wizards to come up with solutions.  Not only that but I'm putting out thousands of lines of code, working with every wizard I can to teach them and tutor them, improve their skills, and encourage them, whereas you're most happy when you can sit on star and just talk shit about people as a playerchar.  I'm responding here, in this way, because you forced this.  The bottom line is that you spend your time on as a wizard griping and using the snoop command.  I spend mine coding and teaching others and encouraging others and administrating.  This is not even an implication, it's  simple fact.  The logs, the inherits and bug logs and everything else and every wizard on here, pretty much, speak for this, without me having to, yet you want to have a pissing contest.  How about this, put up, shut up, and have a positive impact other than resting on a single, minor area, you did however many years ago, with no positive impact since, instead of trying to put down my efforts.  Ego?  You're real funny, since you aren't even a competant builder, talking about someone that is a highly competant coder, that is doing their best to incorporate the ideas of everyone playing and coding for the game, especially where you just gripe and offer no solutions or work.  When you actually make a contribution open your mouth.  But that isn't going to happen, so just shut the fuck up.  -Earwax/David Halek **boltar** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: chip) zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 13:37  All,   If you have something to say, say it to me.

I take responsibility for not being socially  good enough myself to keep a peace and get people to work good enough  together. but the fact remains that unless we complete some serious  rennovations the mud will just slide into obscurity.   Since there is no one else to do it. All conflicts between wizards  will be resolved by me. Odds are everyone involved will hate my solutions so I advise living and let live as much as possible and don't do things that you know are going to result in conflict or displine or even questionable if you're seen/caught doing them.   I need productive people right now, not squabbles. Everyone needs to add something positive. I can't have people that just exist to cause conflict because they find it entertaining to do so. I don't need people getting pissed off at every little thing. What the mud needs, what I need for the mud are productive people.  It's that simple. And before there is any more squabbling, ask yourself where you(individuals) are on that, and that is the squabbling going to  lead to anything positive or just piss people off so we get even more  short handed?   I'll leave it at that.   -Bp  **earwax**Subj: Nirvy reward point stuffsCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,mokri,pavlik,fakir,sparrow,angel,khrell,brittany,tristian,rumplemintz,linus,yumcha,mosobp,stardream,marthaDate: Aug 21 07:09I've finally redone my writeup, after having lost the file somehow and throwing away my hand-written notes.
