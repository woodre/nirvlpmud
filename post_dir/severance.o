I'll check back later though and hopefully we can catch up :) Miss ya! **recca**Subj: Guild LadderCc: hughDate: Apr 30 02:55Due to the new Guild Law, some CyberNinjas have been removed from the Ladder. This includes Pike, and the people I have not chosen under my ladder. I posted a not on the Guild board. I understand some might be upset, or looking to rejoin the Ladder. If they are upset, please send them my way. I will confront the actions I have made. If they seek to rejoin the Guild leadership, please let me know your honest thoughts on them. Also, if you feel I have made any mistakes in removing anybody, of coarse feel free to tell me as always. I want you two to be completely honest with me at all times, even if it is the "harsh truth".  Thanks, - Recca  P.S. I have extended the position of Enforcer to Xiao. Please let me know ASAP your thoughts on him, in that position. **hugh**Subj: LadderCc: (To: recca) severanceDate: May  1 14:20I was waiting for the cull to happen.  I expected it sooner. I'm fine with it.  And AFAIK there arent any remaining leadership  that was chosen only with a vote and therefor not under one Directive's "cabinet".    I dont have a real opinion of Xiao.  I got kind of a twat impression of them.  But then I've never had a real conversation with them either.  since they dont bow down to the altar of Hugh...Fuck 'em. Am I right.  /elbow nudge nudge  (Yes, everything said about Xaio is tongue-in-cheek.)  PS I hate the mudmail and board text layout.  Hugh **seven**Subj: curtsey and respectCc: (To: recca) severance, hughDate: Aug 11 21:30I was informed tonight that I should bow instead of curtsey "because being a cyber comes before my gender."  What are your thoughts on this? **symbio**Subj: New lawCc: (To: recca) severance, merto, hughDate: Aug 20 21:19Today a brand new CyberNinja created a vote where he/she wants to remove all guild positions.  I thought it was absurd so I squashed it until we could all have a discussion on the matter.  I created a new law stating that a CyberNinja needs to be in the guild for 30 days, and max beltlevels and chiplevels before he/she can create a vote that would effectively change the guild.   Does this sound unreasonable?  Also, I think that Jinichi may be on to something. I believe there should be term limits to Directive positions.  I also believe those term limits should be protected to some degree.  For example, I would propose 6 month term limits where the Directive could not be voted out of office, except with a...say...90% vote.  What are your thoughts?  -Symb **symbio**Subj: The lawCc: (To: recca) severance,merto,hughDate: Aug 21 17:55So I'm not sure if you received my mud mail, but I sent it to all of the officers so that we could discuss it.  I received a reply from Severance who basically said that's not how it is written in the help files, but he seemed to somewhat agree to it (please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not trying to put words in peoples mouths).  I haven't heard from anyone else.  I think it's an interesting topic.  Should someone who joined the guild THAT day create a vote to remove the entire guild ladder?  I see that as being extremely disrespectful.  They don't even know the guild yet, and they're already trying to usurp the ladder.  Also, I was very clear that I made that law effective immediately, but that we would collectively discuss the matter together, so that we could maybe come to a more sensible solution...one that we all agreed on.  I don't think what you posted was very smart Recca.  I think it was pretty rude.  I wasn't trying to be a dick.  I wasn't trying to be a dictator.  I was very open to discussing this issue with all of you and I made that very clear.  -Symb **"
