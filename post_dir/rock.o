He is in debt to the ATM about 100k credits.I've told him NOT to buy any enhancements or chip upgrades until he pays back what is owed.  I'm writing to the sensei that have been around lately to please cooperate and NOT upgrade his chips until given the 'all clear' by me or one of the officers.  Much thanks.Doodle**sunim**Subj: ChettCc: (To: mizan) doodle,tenchu,hugh,korwrath,bishop,pike,war,miso,poggio,rattlehead,shadowstone,rock,demonic,kid,valerieDate: Oct 25 22:15I talked to Chett tonight regarding his guild suspension.He said he has been suspended for about 4 months now for a series of "minor" infractions, and he claimed he did not know exactly what those infractions were. Chett is not a personal friend of mine, but he is a fellow guildmate and due to my position as a sensei, I told him I would talk to the heiarchy as well as to you mizan to get his suspension reviewed.I asked chett if he would accept re-instatement at the price of a significant reduction to his right now cognizant honor, as well as a type of probation where my fellow senseis and the guild leaders could actively monitor wether or not he was following the Way in a proper manner, and he said that these would be acceptable terms. At the very least I would like all of your thoughts as to his case... To speak a few words in his defense, I have pked beside him and he is a good pker, at least to the point of putting out a noticeable effort.I look forward in hearing from all of you regarding this matter, thanks for taking the time in advance.With the utmost respect,Sunim**"
