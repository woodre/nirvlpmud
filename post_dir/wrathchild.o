messages "pestilence**Subj: WizardshipDate: Sep 17 20:04You have been either inactive and/or unproductive, as result of this youhave been Dewized.  Good news is that there is a way to have your wizshiprestored.  If you feel you can become a productive member of the wizard familyyou can mail me, and you'll be given 1 chance to prove you can be productive.You'll be given a 2 week probation period, where you'll be watched to see ifthere is any attempt to code and create.  This will be your only chance, soif you choose to come back don't mess it up.  And remember i'm not the cause of your dewizing, nor did i do the actuall act, I'm here to offer you a secondchance.  Thanx for taking time to read this.Pestilence**"
