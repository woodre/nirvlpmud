Jaraxle's area, from tree. enter tree. 2n,ne, enter vortex (if there). you will be in the church basically.  Because Jaraxle's new area is a cover of village. go to where wizardkind would be. from enter vortex it's like e,se,4e,2n,w. the guy's name is magi something. anyways buy empty bottles from him for 4kthen go to where the pass would be. go pass, and wander around, there are phantoms in there. kill the phantoms, most are between 60-80k.  After they are dead, type 'capture spirit' and you'll capture one with an empty bottle. then take the bottle back to the Magi guy (where wizardkind is) and trade bottle. sometimes you get coins (most of the time). occassionally you'll get orbs. nature's blessing, hand of Aclepius (healing), prismatic stronghold (defense), etc.**pestilence**Subj: blindsideDate: Jan  7 05:34for some odd reason it's add_action was gone should be fine, it alsoworks as bs.P**goten**Subj: ArmyDate: Apr 14 17:26Subj: ArmyDate: Mar 17 21:54I have temporarily closed the army because of my inactivity.
