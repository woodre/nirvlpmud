messages "earwax**Subj: masons and noobsCc: (To: angel) lacar,redroses,tombsurferDate: Mar 23 05:46Ok, here's the deal... I'm doing up the daemon, gob, command system.  Other than what I'm  doing in that regard, the guild on the player-end will remain EXACTLY the same as it was...  I talked with bolts on it, and he's of the  same opinion:  give players a taste of old nirvy.  On the code end, it's going to be an extremely advanced guild/mini-guild....but that's for efficiency purposes and players won't know about that shit.  Now, next business:  noob interface. As far as we're concerned (we're meaning me, bolts, verte, fred) The noob interface designers are you, me lacar.  What this means is that you and lacar figure out what to do, and I build the interface. I'll do the engine - HOW shit runs, the shit that makes shit run, but the 2 of you are going to figure out the atmosphere, what does what, etc...I personally feel (and I'm not alone in this) that you two are singularly suited for this project.  We'll do masons first, I have to recode what I already had in place, since my computer crashed, but I'll have the core mason system in  place by the weekend.  After that, it's up to you to update the rest of the stuff.  No ansi, no nothing that's not existing in original guild - everything identical to how it was - bolts and i thoroughly agree on this, especially me as i was originally a mason :)  The noob stuff we'll get moving on after that, and I expect a lot of work.  The rewards will be proportional, and it will be a group  project by all means, meaning I'm not the end-all/be-all of it, I'm going to basically defer to the opinions of you and Lacar, as you  two are better suited for this project.  I'm purely the engine-coder for this.  I'm just going to be doing the background shit, so I expect to see a lot of cooperation and communication between you two; especially considering the fact that this is possibly the single-most important project going on right now.  Questions, etc, as always feel free to tell/mail me: -david **earwax**Subj: stuffs in generalCc: (To: tombsurfer) redrosesDate: Mar 23 06:09I expect to see some things from you as a wizard. I don't expect you to be the top coder ever, BUT I do expect an  effort - you've been here a long time, and you hopefully enjoy the game as much as I do, and have the same sense of loyalty... Therefore, check your mail from lacar :)  Anyways, you and Angel are now my staff.  You two will be working  with and under me regarding revamping how we treat noobs here, and everything to do in that regard.    You and Angel basically will be dictating policy and I will be  signing off on it.  -David **angel**Subj: thanks!Date: Jan  2 18:37if there is a bug juat type 'bug' and then what the problem is.  I fixed it and there was a  problem in the code for the ap office so warning go in prepared next time.  ;) agian thanks!   Angel :) **hadus**Subj: emailDate: Jul  7 22:18Hey, sorry about earlier, u can email me all your info at jimnjenwilliams@hotmail.com Thanks a ton! Hadus **"
