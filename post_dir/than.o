I don't think it would be a good fit and it would only lead to frustration both on your part and the administrations.  We thank you for your devotion to Nirvana and encourage you to keep playing and helping improve the game from within. We will keep your application on file and the need arises, we will be in contact with you about any possibilities.  Thank you, Vital  p.s. Please consider this the decision of the game's administration and binding until such time as you are contacted concerning it again. **"
