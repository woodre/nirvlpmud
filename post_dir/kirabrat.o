messages "chip**Subj: Hdg areaCc: (To: whoa) kirabratDate: Nov  5 07:24hey you :) i forgot to add you to the cc list of this mail somehow but here ya go babe!  As you guys know, as this character or Sephiroth, I'm an HdG mudder as well, born and raised. My first area I'm going to make will be the town of Havre de Grace, including the heights, state park, schools (minus;bakerfield), most of rt 40, the downtown area and the waterside. I'd like  to get ideas and input from all of you who would be interested in bringing  our beloved HdG onto Nirvana and make it the best area it can possibly be.  I've got a majority of it mapped out on paper as a reference for directions  and order of streets and businesses. But there's still alot to do as far as  detail and setting it up to be coded. All ideas and suggestions will be  taken into serious consideration, and many I'm pretty sure will get used.  For all those who actively participate in this hometown pride even as I  like to call it, I'll have a plaque or something of the sort set up in one  of the main areas of it with the names listed of all those who help bring  it together. I want it to be the best it can be, as I'm sure all of you do  too. Mail me anything you think of, or email it to me at  nyteshade187@hotmail.com / message it to me at  well some reason it won't enter the rest on my zmud but you know how to get in touch with me :P any input you got, Kira, will be looked into seriously :) hope to hear something back f f f **"
