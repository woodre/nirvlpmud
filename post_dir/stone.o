After thinking about it for a while, I wish to join your ranks, the ranks of the alliance. I know I can't kill evil players, which I wish I could, but I can bring alot more to the knights. I have the ability to gain gear, coins, and weapons that most other players cannot, simply because I have the ability to use Dark Tetrapod.  There isn't much more I can bring to the knights, but to always be there for those who need assisting.  Please take into consideration my request to join the alliance. I humley await your reply.SignedThe Warrior**"
