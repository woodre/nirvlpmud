Once they are met, I will then conduct an interview and from that I will make my final decision. The requirements are as follows: 1) Acquire level 15 or higher. 2) Your stamina/strength/magic/piety/luck/willpower stats must all be 20 or higher. 3) You must find the pieces to, and construct, a beautiful ruby amulet and deliver it to me. These things will show your strength, and will to survive, as well as your knowledge of this world as a whole. If you have any questions concerning these minor tasks just send me a mail back and let me know what it is you have a question about. Once these tasks are complete, mail me and we will set up a time to meet and conduct the final interview. Be safe and fare well. Jacob, the Emperor of the Samurai **"
