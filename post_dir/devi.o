My first area I'm going to make will be the town of Havre de Grace, including the heights, state park, schools (minus bakerfield), most of rt 40, the downtown area and the waterside. I'd like to get ideas and input from all of you who would be interested in bringing our beloved HdG onto Nirvana and make it the best area it can possibly be. I've got a majority of it mapped out on paper as a reference for directions and order of streets and businesses. But there's still alot to do as far as detail and setting it up to be coded. All ideas and suggestions will be taken into serious consideration, and many I'm pretty sure will get used. For all those who actively participate in this hometown pride even as I like to call it, I'll have a plaque or something of the sort set up in one of the main areas of it with the names listed of all those who help bring it together. I want it to be the best it can be, as I'm sure all of you do too. Mail me anything you think of, or email it to me at nyteshade187@hotmail.com / message it to me at http://www.myspace.com/lostminddeusesmuerte, or IM me at knockmyselfout82. And as I will be taking this project very seriously, only serious suggestions will be considered. Hope to hear things back from you guys (and girl lol). Best wishes. **"
