It's not something I was intending on doing, until I \nrealized that Katya also had a copy of code that was doing this. \n \nIn the future please do not provide her with any code that can do \nthis functionality. You're not in trouble here, and i'm not trying to \nforce my hand on you- it's just that if someone else saw it (like Earwax) \nit would have been a problem. Deleting the files was a quick and dirty \nsolution. I also deleted the 'idlers' functionality on her side as well. \n \nJust use your judgement and don't put things back into your wiztool \nunless it's something that helps you code areas or is something harmless \nlike a toy/emoter or similar. If you want a copy of the backup let me \nknow. I apologize if this seems heavy handed but it really isn't my \nintent at all. It was a matter of seeing something potentially embarrassing \nand just stuffing it under the carpet, if you know what i mean. \n \n-miz \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: Guild cmds\n\nDate: Jul 14 16:08\n\nOK, previous_object() simply returns the object that called the command. In \nmost cases that will be the guild object. So if you wanted to call a function \nin the guild object you would do: \n \nprevious_object()->query_mon_color(); for example \n \nIf you want to tell the user a message, you would need previous_object but \nnot quite the way you did it.  You would want it to be like: \n \ntell_object( environment(previous_object()), \"Your mark of the Dark Order darkens...\\n\"); \n \nIf previous_object() returns the guild obj, then the environment of that obj is the player. \n \nHope that helps? \n--Gnar \n\n**\nillarion\n**\nSubj: offwield\n\nDate: Aug  8 21:50\n\n/players/vertebraker/guilds/samurai/bin/_offwield.c \n \nnote that the guild object keeps track of the offwielded weapon, \nbut you could simply loop all the player's weapons and check for \none instead of keeping track of it in the guild object \n \nif you want to add a guild damage bonus I recommend either \nusing the weapon.c enchant code or else the more global \nRegisterWeaponBonus in living.c rather than using gen_wc_bonus \nor a shadow \n\n**\nfred\n**\nSubj: DO\n\nDate: Sep 11 12:42\n\nOkay.  If you feel comfortable with where they are you can open them back \nup.  Thanks. \n \n Fred \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: cblast\n\nDate: Sep 23 20:41\n\nApproved. I had to add some code to do some checks, I found a bug \nwhich came from my meth (which I updated as well.) \nApproval added to wlog. \n--John \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: Chrono Blast\n\nDate: Sep 25 14:50\n\nI found a bug with your new heal. If you tox out and try to drink \nit, it will make you more evil but not use the heal. I think the only \nway to fix it is to update /obj/generic_heal. I will keep you posted. \n--Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: cblast\n\nDate: Sep 25 20:53\n\nFixed. Details in wlog. \n\n**\nfred\n**\n Re:   sp only heals\nDate: Oct 30 09:46\n\nWorks for me. \n \nFred \n\n**\nboltar\n**\n Re:   daycare\nDate: Oct 31 10:14\n\n \nThere are 45 spaces still left in dc5.  \nlooks like someone editing it recently. Maybe something was broke in the code.  \n \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: LD\n\nCc: (To: shinshi) rumplemintz,fred,star,pestilence\nDate: Feb 25 16:36\n\nWe did a lot of testing on LD today. If you see things \nin the logs that look illegal, such as giving players coins \netc. keep in mind the logs between LD/LP are shared. Check \nwith me before you punish someone. Sami/Krillgeta/Yen and all \nof their alts are helping me test the guilds on LD. \nThanks, \n-Gnar \n\n**\n"
