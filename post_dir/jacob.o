I will speak to you more in-depth about it when I see you on. I wish you the best until then and am looking forward to seeing if you've really got what a Samurai should be made of :) Take care and be well. Jacob the Emperor (Born from the 7th Circle) **valen**Subj: korwarthDate: Jul 17 23:07I don't have no opinion on weather he joins the Samuari or not.  I hardly know the guy or the mud.  So, I will trust your good judgement on him.  If you decided its in the Samurai's good interest to let him in.  Then I'll follow your lead on him.   Valen **korwrath**Subj: Demon BeltCc: (To: valen) jacobDate: Jul 19 10:47After a long bloody quest against that which will lurk in the darkness, I have succeded in attaining the belt you have requested.  From the hated Sembrak, into deep forest I ventured.  Hideous undead and twisted creatures barred my path, yet I cut them down and entered cave, dark and needing a great many torches to light my path.  Dishonorably though the  demons fight and in numbers.  I slew them, two  were skinned and I took the hides to the Yelmites and had it forged into a belt, for a princly sum of 2,000 coins.   I await your response, Emperor.  -Korwrath the Ronin **tsukune**Subj: samuraiDate: Jun 26 12:59hi i was looking at the guilds to join and i thought out of all of them urs was the best and was wanting to join the samurai guild i would love if you could mail me back the req for joining please QQ `f `f **darkfyre**Subj: jasonDate: Feb 27 02:50attacked me in a party and did not declare his intent he died but still broke the code! "f f **jaucribaix**Subj: SamuraiCc: (To: heinous) jacob,sparrowDate: Mar  7 11:34I am wanting to learn more about your Samurai guild.  I have asked a couple of people about them and they sound interesting.  If you would be kind enough to provide more information I would greatly appreciate it. Sparrow gave me basic principals of guild.  Mostly that you wouldn't even consider anything under 15. Look forward to hearing from you either way  Thanks **worm**Subj: Rust, get it! if you havent.Cc: wreckageDate: Feb 22 23:10you liked minecraft.. well, get Rust and come kick it with me. its a cool builder.. just add in guns & survival. ppl to kill,  forts to loot, etc. **"
