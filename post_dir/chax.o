I've been asking for it for months, but I haven't seen anything.  Yesterday, I recommended automatic dewizzing of all wizards not involved, so I'm trying to prevent this because it WILL happen otherwise.  In other words, I'm trying to see work done, so this doesn't happen, although if it doesn't I'm the  one to blame and the first to take the blame, because I fully intend to dewiz every single individual that does not get involved.  I have the position, I have the power, and i'm using it, is the bottom line.  If you want to keep your wizard get involved with this.  It's seriously the most important project in the last 15 years.  -david (dhalek@comcast.net) **"
