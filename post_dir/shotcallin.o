And Valen needs to keep to his word about what he says as far as requirements to joining the guild. Valen told Shootcallin to get level 8 and he would recruit him untill chiele had come along and put their 2 sense in. Chiele hasnt done anything to benefit the samurai to begin with. I think there needs to be rules for emperors to be following as well as more of a tighter selection as to who is to become emperor. Can you please get back to me on this and deal with it. I would greatly appreciate it. I don't want the guild falling apart due to crappy emperor not doing the responsibilties and going back on words as well as other issues. Thanks for your time in reading this. If you need more information about the situation please ask Hedren **vertebraker**Subj: LDMudDate: Jun  8 14:33Ok, the address is    nirvanamud.com port 3535    Your character does not save, although lockers DO.  So avoid using that means of storage.    Just login, play a bit, report bugs with the "bug" cmd.  The more bugs you report, the more likely I am to give  you a reward :^)  **worm**Subj: ShardaksDate: Jun 13 11:53 Ok.. yuo dont get an attack spell until grank 3.  you cant cast ANY player spells once you join. 1st level..0 -2nd level.98,384 -3rd level..457,136 -4th level.1,280,000 -5th level..2,752,690 -6th level..5,108,560 -7th level..8,691,344 -8th level..12,913,564  so.. you can see what you'd be getting into. there is a weapon that may help... the scarlet scimitar.. has spells built in. lemme know what u think **jacob**Subj: Shardaks untimely demise!Cc: (To: worm) mistaken,wreckage,vertebraker,alora,shotcallin,nyteshade,budah,tirnokDate: Jun 16 05:05        A sound like wailing winter winds is heard as you behead Shardak! Shardak died. Experience Gained: 898120 Shardak's mutilated corpse falls to the ground, but a shimmering image remains where he just stood.   You brutally slide Head of Shardak onto your long spike.   Just giving you details ;) muhah! **shotcallin**Subj: heyCc: (To: worm) shotcallinDate: Mar 19 01:57apparently i lost a shit ton of spells to shardak any way of me regaining them?
