I thought it was absurd so I squashed it until we could all have a discussion on the matter.  I created a new law stating that a CyberNinja needs to be in the guild for 30 days, and max beltlevels and chiplevels before he/she can create a vote that would effectively change the guild.   Does this sound unreasonable?  Also, I think that Jinichi may be on to something. I believe there should be term limits to Directive positions.  I also believe those term limits should be protected to some degree.  For example, I would propose 6 month term limits where the Directive could not be voted out of office, except with a...say...90% vote.  What are your thoughts?  -Symb **severance**Subj: reply Date: Aug 20 21:28for some reason reply wouldnt let me add you.  here is what i sent I am fine with the term limits. However if you want to go by the help files written for the voting system it is for all ninjas not just those that have been in x time frame or maxed. Term reqs and and limits seem fine to me though   **symbio**Subj: The lawCc: (To: recca) severance,merto,hughDate: Aug 21 17:55So I'm not sure if you received my mud mail, but I sent it to all of the officers so that we could discuss it.  I received a reply from Severance who basically said that's not how it is written in the help files, but he seemed to somewhat agree to it (please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not trying to put words in peoples mouths).  I haven't heard from anyone else.  I think it's an interesting topic.  Should someone who joined the guild THAT day create a vote to remove the entire guild ladder?  I see that as being extremely disrespectful.  They don't even know the guild yet, and they're already trying to usurp the ladder.  Also, I was very clear that I made that law effective immediately, but that we would collectively discuss the matter together, so that we could maybe come to a more sensible solution...one that we all agreed on.  I don't think what you posted was very smart Recca.  I think it was pretty rude.  I wasn't trying to be a dick.  I wasn't trying to be a dictator.  I was very open to discussing this issue with all of you and I made that very clear.  -Symb **sektor**Subj: gatmCc: (To: severance) mertoDate: Nov  7 19:00deposited 409000 for my new recruit rikimaru **sektor**Subj: sektor enforcerCc: (To: sami) mertoDate: Nov 11 18:01help me get enforcer spot im on every day just about here and there vote has already been cr created* **"
