And of course you need both rings to combine them, so I find it curious that so many players have them. I've never gotten either one of them. **dragnar**Subj: HiCc: **Date: Dec  9 07:58Sorry my client logs me back in after a reboot (well sometimes it works) so I look active but I'm really not. How's things, I've been busy so I haven't run into you much lately. You have a list of Shardak things that need to be overhauled yet :) ? **dragnar**Subj: DOCc: **Date: Jan  9 10:15I can get you into DO, just let me know. You need to be level 15. I'd max pie and wil stats first. Gnar/Dread **dragnar**Subj: Re:   ThanksCc: **Date: Jan  9 11:13You know Gizmo can join other guilds too? When you restore your guild after doing a prestige you can pick from any guilds you've been in. Just an option! **"
