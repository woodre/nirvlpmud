You hate to look at me! *sobs quietly* Its your fault too! You my babies DADDY!   Well thats just it. I cant take it any longer. I am retiring to the darkest corners of my hole and never coming out again. *sighs as she wipes a tear from her eye* So long cruel world! To my husband, I bid adu. Many kisses and much love to my children and my family! For this MAN takes me from the world due to a broken heart.
