I saw you do something with my own eyes and when I asked you about it, you denied that it happened. What's upsetting is that this was all over some minor stuff that shouldnt have been of any consequence- a minor issue. But now i can't trust you. If you're going to lie about something silly (like who took the last beer) then how can I count on you when something major comes up?  I still think that you being banned outright was too harsh, but the amount of spin you're putting on your side of the story is steadily making me feel like EW did the right thing.  At this point, what would you want done that would improve things to your satisfaction? Because i really just dont trust you at all man, but i am still ears to what you have to say. **pesty** Re:   earwaxCc: (To: mizan) pestyDate: Aug 26 19:57You say i spammed ip, then i spammed it, i can't say why i did it but i know it wasn't to hide anything, and i know you don't believe me in this, but i can say when you think i lied, your are assuming my intent, and noone knows my intent but me so it's not factual. And i honestly don't think i've put any spin on my side, everyone who has spoken to me about it i told them that i broke the rules and i was definitely guilty. I really feel bad that you don't trust me, And I would do anything to gain the trust back.  I don't know what would bring things to my satisfaction, but no matter what i have done, I don't think that it's right for a high lvl wiz to be telling people they shouldn't talk to me, talking to others like they are his children, and making slanderous remarks about people.  That is improper personal etiquette on the game and real life.    If i was given a chance, I would like to proof myself worthy, my possible suggestion, if you deem i'm worthy of this chance, is possibly gain lvl 21 pending a new area, and being a productive part of the game, and if that isn't met, in a certain time frame automatic demotion, banishment, whatever you seem fit.  I would want the decision in your hands, but not in Earwax, for as you say you can't trust me, I feel the same but worse, for earwax, a former roommate of his told me many things he said about me in the past as well.  I thank you for taking time to respond  and to listen to me. P **mizan** Re:   earwaxCc: boltar,vertebraker,fredDate: Aug 28 20:53(for those who were not CCed originally please refer to the end of  /log/mizan.mbox to catch up. Thanks)  I did read your mudmail pretty much as soon as you sent it, but wanted to sit and reflect on it for a while before making a reply. So here it is...  I'd like to say i am someone who believes in second chances. Because the only thing we are perfect at is perfectly fucking up every once in a while. But more on that thought later.  I havent said anything about you except to a few other wizards, so I'm not sure if you're talking to me or Earwax in this respect. I have expressed my displeasure and disappointment in this issue to perhaps two players- Worm, and Veeshan. I have spoken with other wizards such as Katya, Khrell, and a little bit with Boltar, Fred, and Verte. But that's it. Nothing I haven't said to your face i've said outside, so there should be no surprises there.  While I don't trust you completely (being TOTALLY honest here) you didn't do something malicious like attack the mud or try to do outright damage. To me you went down like a death by a million papercuts, with looking at code for the wrong reasons, or for generally goofy and dodgy shit.  So in closing I would support your return, as a L21 or L30 wizard because you did code an area here, are held in generally good regards among the players. But your return would have the following conditions:  1) No L40+ access to other wizard code until trust is regained.    Bear in mind that this can take a serious amount of time.  2) No invis while you have player characters logged in.    This can be code enforced to prevent accidents. It's not meant to    be as a leash. I think you know where I stand on this.  3) No more discussion on the matter, we settle the issue here and now    and not let it fester any further. You've admitted to some part of    what you've done, and while some of us may think there is more-    that stops now- you have a clean slate to try and prove yourself    again, unshackled of prejudice that may have accumulated so far.  These are just my thoughts. I think these terms are perfectly reasonable. I'd like to know what you or others think about this matter.  -miz **hardly**Subj: wizard appCc: starDate: Aug 10 21:52Hello  i am applying for wizardship and in need of a sponsor and a mentor. hopefully you can help.  thanks **"
