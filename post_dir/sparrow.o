Anyways as players gain a level they gain perhaps 5 attrib points to distribute as they wish, perhaps a random stat will raise automatically each level.  Max for each stat will be 30, to conform with current standards; each race however, will have different maxes for each stat, with 30 being the ceiling.  Stats will be more in control of a char's power than level, but they gain stats through levels and xlevels.  Currently I don't have anything planned for gaining stats in any way other than level, although that may change.  strength:     damage bonuses in combat, carry capacity dexterity:    chance to hit in combat, dodge, parry, skills etc constitution: hp, hpr (regen rate), endurance points, epr willpower:    innate resistances, willpower type checks, has an effect on ep mental:       sp/spr, int/wis checks  racial, static stats: they either don't change, or aren't controlled by char: luck:      they can 'roll' this stat at char generation charisma:  also roll this at char generation, within limits set by race size:      this will go up as they level, until they reach their max size            also a rolled stat  Specifics:  HP: 10* con + 2*level + 2*xlevel      7  con at level 1  means 72  max hp - higher than now     30 con at level 19 means 338 max hp - about equivalent to now  SP: 10* men + 3*level + 3*xlevel      7  men at level 1  = 73      30 men at level 19 = 357   EP: 7*con + 3*wil + 2*level + 2*xlevel  HPR: racial modifier + con hp regen per minute, max of 60 SPR: racial modifier + men sp regen per minute EPR: racial modifier + 2/3 con + 1/3 wil  current stat checks will be routed to the most appropriate stat  Implementation: these won't go fully into the game for general players until this stuff has been thoroughly tested and races, gear changes, skills are ready to go in as well, but they will be the first in for testing. **earwax**Subj: that link..bubble sortDate: Sep 16 03:59that was for a bubble sort actually, NOT a 2x bubble path algorithm basically, the way the path algorithm works, is you take a startign point from both the start and the target, and you send out nodes from each, and where they intersect, they each trace back and return what becomes the shortest path, it's a high-memory usage, but high- speed algorithm  bubble sort is just another binary (damn near radix) sort on arrays **earwax**Subj: mosobpDate: Oct  1 06:491 ]he should become active 2 ]Garbageman leaves south. if he doesn't he'll be a casualty 3 ]X (verte) is back apparentlyh 4 ]We will have discussions, he's not talking to me yet, but we will 5 ]I'm NOT a fucking administrator, i'm supposed to be a coder and designer 6 ]not an approver or administrator or anything else.

Verte is probably dead even  or behind me, for lib code...neither of us can even approach what  bolts has in...his contributions to this game are seriously incalculable. I say this because most players and even wizards have no clue about it but that motherfucker has got his name all over damn near every piece of code in the game...that's worthy of some serious respect.  Bottom line...eurale and some others will pull power games and try to use their names or what they've done...bottom line, you're under me and NOBODY has a bigger name in the lib than me other than boltar... that's not ego, it's bottom line.  Anyone gives you shit, let me know I will dewiz them...let fred know, he will do the same....fred is a fucking god.  Don't take shit from anyone no matter what level unless they are me, verte, or boltar or fred...and i can guarantee that we won't.  Any issues bring them up to me, or fred, we WILL handle them.  God forbid, once i talk to verte, that you bring an issue up to him.. he doesn't handle issues very well, he'd prolly just siteban the motherfucker and rape their pets. -dave **earwax**Subj: hehDate: Oct  8 06:261 ]Let's see.

The bottom 30]line is that you spend your time on as a wizard griping and using the 31]snoop command.  I spend mine coding and teaching others and encouraging 32]others and administrating.  This is not even an implication, it's  33]simple fact.  The logs, the inherits and bug logs and everything else 34]and every wizard on here, pretty much, speak for this, without me 35]having to, yet you want to have a pissing contest.  How about this, 36]put up, shut up, and have a positive impact other than resting on 37]a single, minor area, you did however many years ago, with no positive 38]impact since, instead of trying to put down my efforts.  Ego?  You're 39]real funny, since you aren't even a competant builder, talking about 40]someone that is a highly competant coder, that is doing their best 41]to incorporate the ideas of everyone playing and coding for the game, 42]especially where you just gripe and offer no solutions or work. 43] 44]When you actually make a contribution open your mouth.

I do know though Ritcher will most likely be making a return, he's Cloud and Cloud's back so he's likely to want to play his Ranger with us at times once Ritcher's player file is restored. but there should be some spaces for people who will be active to become new recruits rather than keeping the list as is with non-members and ones who won't return. you know as well as me man, this isn't fair to those who will be active and want to play a ranger and would do well as one. let me know what you think and what happens so I can keep an ear open for feesible prospects. also if you could, if and when you update the roster list post a news/guild board bulletin about it so people will know there's going to be openings and those who fit the bill of who and what we're looking for, can ask around with us Rangers and see about some new blood. let me know what's up bro. pz! Seph, The Eggplant Bastard!

She completed everything up to and including the Holy Grail. After giving Jacoby the Holy Grail and trying all three command phrases (I checked the code) nothing happened. No response was given from Jacoby. She had the scroll on her,  the guild object worn, and even set pk to be sure. The commands that she used were: say complete, say completed and say done. I can vouch that she completed the quest as far as I could tell by Jacoby's code.  Next issue: The Dragon that has the Holy Grail caused some issues yesterday. I was fighting the dragon as tyr in a party with fastkill. When the dragon died I lost heartbeat and  another dragon spawned and attacked. I beatfix and we killed the second dragon, lost heartbeat again and a third dragon appeared. Beatfix again and killed the third one. A FOURTH one spawned. At this point we decided to leave. I'm not sure if this was an issue with the dragon's code, ranger code, bloodfist code.

I decided to create a new character recently and I can say that at low levels weapon upkeep is no small matter. If you throw armor into the mix it would be almost unbearable for a true newb. Maybe making the cost of repair or access to a qualified artisan be based on quality of the item. Make it more  expensive for high quality gear and not all smiths/armorers are up to the task. This will also help with an issue that I think we have: newbies with legendary gear. If they cant afford the upkeep they will be more likely to use gear that is more appropriate to their level.  Anyways that's my two cents **boltar** Re:   item decayCc: vertebraker,fred,boltar,sparrow,mizan,angel,vertebraker,rumplemintz,illarionDate: Feb 16 23:56 I am more with sparrow on this. too make things too much of a pain will only discourage people. good stuff should also last longer than cheap stuff.

In the dir /players/mizan/opl/generator are the tools i am currently coding/messing with to create the realm I am working on which is essentially just a giant, randomly generated maze.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/generate_maze.py is some Python code which currently is hardcoded to build 100 x 40 sized text mazes. The #'s are navigable areas, while the periods are no-man lands. It can be executed on a system with Python installed by invoking 'python generate_maze.py'.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/compile_maze.sh is just a little script that saves human-readable output of the maze to file, and also makes a copy which has no line breaks.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/process_maze.pl is then the perl code which actually builds up the .c room files which are all stored in /players/mizan/opl/CELLS. My code as usual is not formatted very cleanly because it's a work in progress. Essentially in this file, I read the output from compile_maze.sh, and iterate through all the rooms. I am basically counting exits- if I see dead ends, I randomly put a monster or something interesting in it. If I see intersections, I crowd them up with monsters that 'block' them. Things like that.  Additionally, here is something which may be of great interest to Verte. http://iceyboard.no-ip.org/dg/ This is an instant town generator, written in PHP. The code is available at http://iceyboard.no-ip.org/dg/?source=1  Also, a cave generator which I found lives inside /players/mizan/opl/generator/cave shows promise, it just needs some tweaks so that certain passages always remain 'open'.  I'm no expert on this stuff, it's been a bit of here and that tinkering for me so far. Go nuts. -tij  **boltar** Re:   Stuff i have been working on which may be useful to othersCc: mizan,vertebraker,boltar,vertebraker,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,sparrow,angelDate: Feb 24 20:10   I like the idea of making the rooms variable and keyed to who goes in them. if can be done that sounds like an excellent idea to make  things much more interesting.  **boltar** Re:   Stuff i have been working on which may be useful to othersCc: (To: sparrow) mizan,vertebraker,boltar,vertebraker,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,sparrow,angelDate: Feb 24 20:10   I like the idea of making the rooms variable and keyed to who goes in them. if can be done that sounds like an excellent idea to make  things much more interesting.  **illarion** Re:   do_special() and armor strikesCc: (To: vertebraker) boltar,vertebraker,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,sparrow,angelDate: Feb 24 21:47Rather than simply blocking additional calls, what about making them less and less likely? First call always goes off, second is if(!random(3)), (33%), !random(6), !random(12), !random(24), etc **vertebraker**Subj: triple xp dayCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,sparrow,angelDate: Mar  3 00:53just a clarification.  i haven't been here much the last few days due to some RL issues like going out of town and being in a car accident. i completely forgot i was going to give out bonus experience on the 26th for the 20th anniversary. someone else must have actually activated it. and i don't blame them either for any mishaps likely since they probably used earwax's likely faulty triple experience code.  i wasn't around at that time, so i have no clue what happened. **angel**Subj: Clan wallsCc: boltar,fred,vertebraker,illarion,mizan,rumplemintzDate: Mar  5 13:54Hey, clan walls cost 10,000 coins and 100 sp as long as it is working correctly.

I wish to seek this power you have discovered and learn of it.  Before you are quick to dismiss my claim, please listen to me. I was once a powerful ArchMage, my tower, or what remains of it, resides in the Isle of the Magi,  you are probably familiar with the terrain, since it lyes close to the Templar Castle.  One day I was searching some old scrolls that I had come across searching the hills near the Creasant Lake when I stumbled across a scroll that spoke of unimaginable power in the Dark arts. As I studied the contents and spells that came to me in deep medication while trying to 'connect' with this Dark power.  The Knights Templar realized the power I had tapped into and grew very jealous, and in their fear they opted a  holy crusade upon my land, deeming all it's inhabitants, heritics, and sentenced everyone to death by 'purification'. Clearly, you will not find any of these words I speak of in any  Templar text, for this is a dark stain upon the cross they wear around their pretenchous necks.   Which with your help, and my diligant studies and piety, I wish to rip from their bodies.  I work hard, and learn quick, I offer respect when respect is due, which only comes to the one more  powerful than I.

How will the system adjust quickly to something like this?  Also I have an idea I have been working with with my frist area along with the one I am making now. A way to limit treasure and items would be to  make good items dropped off mobs be rare drops. This way all the players are not all running around with the best stuff cause you never know when its going to drop. Most of my decent items are coded this way with small percentages to drop good things. This will limit player power and also money, and will keep the player coming back to areas to attempt to get this good equipment. Just an idea. -Cloud **boltar** Re:   Economy ProposalCc: vertebraker,fred,vital,star,illarion,mizan,cloud, rumplemint, hardlyDate: Jan 31 19:01 It seems very complicated and difficult to implement.

I feel a lot of people will choose to just go.    There has to be a more simple way of doing this besides a centralized system.  fixing the amount of coins in the system can cause a problem because other  goods, resources, etc in the game aren't fixed.   Rather than trying to create some complex system that doesn't break down  because money is fixed while goods aren't why not attempt a simple  system that keeps money from being created faster than other goods.   that's what I have for now.  **boltar** Re:   Economy ProposalCc:  vertebraker,fred,vital,star,illarion,mizan,cloud, rumplemintzDate: Feb  2 21:23 With inflation it is the same manipulation as in real world fiat money.  Controlled inflation irl is designed to steal the value of people's savings forcing them into constant economic activity while also stealling the productivity gains of current work over yesterday's work.   Thus if a player isn't on frequently to keep up, he may login and  find he no longer has the funds to be viable and then simply decide  he doesn't want to put in the effort to rebuild. **boltar** Re:   Economy ProposalCc:  vertebraker,fred,vital,star,illarion,mizan,cloud, rumplemintzDate: Feb  5 22:20 I am not being negative. just want to avoid the overly complex  and make things too complex for people to come back or start.  **worm**Subj: hehCc: (To: fred) boltar,illarion,sparrow,mizan,vertebraker,angelDate: Apr 14 02:45i'll send this to all of you, just in case anyone would be interested.  i've had an idea for an area for a long, long time. an area that could change the game. i'll start dedicating time each day to come and help someone (who can actually code) put that area together.  will it shake the ground and make the world knock a bit further off axis? no.  but it will RULE.. and any of the wold players who have come back a number of times before, will come back again. maybe this time, they'll stay longer.  the area will take lotsa work, i'll do most the describes if that helps. :P  **worm**Subj: lolDate: May 30 00:31ok what? i forgot. hehe **boltar**Subj: econDate: Aug 30 16:47 If you'd like to try it, go ahead.

I would like to rewrite the new player creation process and update it dramatically.  It's been so long since I seriously played that I think this is the absolute perfect time to tackle this project.  I know no one really comes here anymore, so it's mostly for shits and giggles, but I'd like it if you could collaborate on this with me.  I have a lot more free time than I did, and I'm in a lot more stable position IRL than I have been in the past.  Hopefully you're still checking in.  Let's get together on this and try to re-build this place a bit.  I work about 8-10 hour days M-F, 2:30 pm - ???  It varies due to workflow, since it's a warehouse.  It'll take me a bit to get (once again) back into the swing of coding, but it's like riding a bicycle.  Feel free to call me if you can't reach me here also.  717-686-1674  I might not pick up the phone right away, but I'll return it.  Hope everything is good with you,  Tom **chip**Subj: rewiz?Date: Dec  9 16:17I would actually like to start working on some of my stuff again, including some new basic noob zones just for added content. Let me know on here in mail, or even better, FB me, if it can happen. also I'll be needing ftp addy info and all if this does happen. Thanks man, hope to hear from ya soon. **chip** Re:   rewiz?Date: Jan 11 08:28Aye. Bolts reinstated me, and Fred set me back to my original level. Good to hear you'll be back around, and are out of the hospital. What happened, if you don't mind my asking? You going to be ok brotha? Anyway hope all is well, and to see you soon, it's been too long. As a basic fill-in of current plans I have for the mud here, I just finished work on a two room Halo based boss area that, once approved, will be attached secretly to a room in my apartment building area. It's located in /players/chip/closed/other/HALO/ . I also have long term project plans for a very basic, but EXTREMELY massive Skyrim based area. All the code will pretty much be basic stuff, but the exploration end of it, and the rewards for such exploration, should be well worth it for whoever decides to check it out. Not sure what level range it will be for yet, but I'm thinking 19 and up, maybe +5 and up, although anyone will be able to enter and look around. Anyway, once again, glad to hear from you and to hear you'll be around. Talk to you soon! Chip **x**Subj: Ok, let's get started.Cc: chip,fred,angelDate: Jan 12 03:55Ok guys. Let me know what you need help with and I'll be here. I work a lot of OT and my schedule changes, but I go in M-F at 2:30 pm.  I work til at least 11.  So I'm most available during the day.  I'm not sure where to start. I would like to get some ideas on what projects to tackle. **x** Re:   Ok, let's get started.Date: Jan 13 02:55Ok, I don't know anything about the skill trees.  Can you draft up some sort of document? I'd like to know how I can fit in here.  Sorry.

On top of those whom he invited, I've invited close to 30 people myself, and hopefully they have more people they can invite as well. In light of this, and knowing I don't have that kind of access, we would like to request a couple of things from the administration, in hopes it will help bring life back to the mud. The first of those requests, is a significant increase, or even maybe removal, of the limit on the number of players that can be in a party. If even half of the people invited make it, there will be 15+ people on at one time, many of whom we can surely say would love to socially group together, definitely with more than 5 to a group. Or, as an alternative (I'm not sure how hard it would be to do by comparison), maybe make it so you can link groups together. Like, form 2 5-person parties, and link them so the channel and experience gains are linked between the groups. Without the social aspect of the mud, it won't go very far in the way of trying to bring it back from the dead, and this sort of thing would help incredibly. The other request is in regards to the alignment killing restriction of Power Rangers. Even if it's just for the reunion day, we would like to request this restriction be lifted, as I know for a fact several of the attendees will be playing their Ranger characters. With this restriction lifted, even if it is just for a day, it will help as far as not limiting where and what these groups (or hopefully, one really big group! lol) can go after. Rangers are generally limited to barely more than half of the mud's npcs, and this would take much of the fun from the reunion day's attentees, knowing they only have a small amount of stuff to do, then waiting for respawns and such. Lastly, this is more of a personal request, if there's anyone you all know, that we were unable to get ahold of to let know this reunion is happening, please take a moment to pass along word of the event, its date, and if they haven't been around since the address changed, the new one of course! Many thanks for the time and help in this from you all. This will hopefully be a day to remember of Nirvana's already colorful history! Hope to see you all there! Sincerely, Chip **boltar** Re:   Mud reunion on Sunday Feb 17, 2013Cc: (To: chip) fred,sparrow,mizan,rumplemintz,illarion,x,vertebraker,angelDate: Feb 11 09:08Paragraphs please. I am having difficulty parsing that.   as to login limits, they are what they are presently.

My idea is player run shops for example:  Timespliter buys the rights to run a heal shop. So no one else from his IP cn own selling rights to other types of shops and he would need to keep the stock in the store up(Basically coins) If a heal cost Timespliter 1000 coins to make and he sold it for 1200 coins 100 of the coins for profit would goto his bank account and 100 would goto taxes for running a shop  in the nirvana economic system.  Other Types of shops could be armor shops, Weapon shops where people could buy and sell specific armor/weapons like a pawn shop.  Profits would be higher in these shops but he demand would be lower than with heals obviously A magic shop where you could get a weapon enchant or magic bags or other types of items.  Dragnar had also suggested some items to upgrade shops that players could make shops cooler so maybe toggle items like did he buy this upgrade .... Also a cavitate to this  is you would not gain coins from your own IP address you would just be able to buy heals wholesale or items wholesale.  If you have worked on a similar project I would like collaborate with you some, if not and you think it sounds like a cool idea I would like to collaborate also....8)  Oh and you can lose a store front if you leave it unattended for 30 days like the old hotel rooms also.  That seemed like a good way to keep people invested but not  over burdened.  Jar. **wicket**Subj: Map for areaDate: Sep  2 08:02map is done and looks good with the way i want it whenever you are ready for next or you have some time let me know.
