Do we need theseppl?  No, we don't.  And by L21 I mean the recently promo'dwizards who seem to make it their only purpose as a wiz tocheck our IPs repeatedly in order to determine our othercharacters and/or stat monsters, and act as a spy to becomebetter players and/or help their friends.We can stop new wizs by simply NOT approvingthem - Ok, that's not working out so well.So.  Fakir and I came up with an idea: All these schlubswe have, let's give them 3 months to open a small area.  And byan area I just mean a decent 10-15 room area like we wouldexpect from any of our apprentices.   mos. from now.  If theydon't have it done, or haven't contributed significantly insome way, we go ahead and knock them back down to player.When they are ready to be a serious wizard they can try again.This rule does not apply to anyone above L21 or people likeMizan [who obviously would be above this rule] and Quicksilver[who helped re-code Shadows years back with Pathfinder and thusI think has earned his wizardship].  It has more to do with NEWwizards if anyone.The quest system is shot and just a small hoop to jump thru now-I think we are suffering simply by allowing too many schlubs in.Anyway, at least consider it.tom/Verte**vertebraker**Subj: ilstkarnDate: Jun  5 22:52ok, ilstkarn is open for YOU only [mantis].Go through it, take as long as you want, letme know how it is.  i've left it "basically"untouched with a few positive mods just to fitthe lib.  i think the area for the most partwas legit, it was the guilds that were the problem :)**vertebraker**Subj: PAv's areaCc: (To: boltar) fakir,mantisDate: Jun  6 00:48I emailed/mudmailed Pav about his code, seeing if he wantsit opened up or not again.  In the meantime, I've gonethrough his subdirs and checked most of the code, updateda lot of it for new follow code, damage types, etc.That is, as far as his area...If it's fine with you, I'm going to have Fakir playtestit for a bit and explore the whole thing as Mantis to makesure everything is working properly before I open it upto the public.  It's a pretty huuuuuge area so it mighttake a little while to get it done.**"
