Youcan choose to remain in the guild but will have very limited guild skills.I'm sorry for this inconvenience.  You can also choose to leave_guildyou will lose no xps or stats or lvls, however you won't get your guild xps restored.I have that information stored so when i reopen the testing if you wish to continue to test you will have your current status reinstated. Any questions or problemsfeel free to mail me.Pestilence**tyr**Subj: AlexaDate: Jul 11 23:18Talus,I dont really know you, but I need to ask you this.I see that now you are married to Alexa. I was wonderinghow serious this was. I am very interested in Alexa and would like to marry her. If you still have feelings for her and want to stay married, that is fine. If you are indifferent and do not care, I would like the oppurtunitymyself. I do care about her a lot.Thank you for your time,Tyr, the Ice Blue Ranger**alexa**Subj: hehDate: Jun 27 08:39You have a strange craving for peanut butter and hot dog sandwiches. Can you say GROSS!!!!! Who craves that!  Anyway, I was here today, but you are prolly sleeping still! I shall talk to ya later! **earwax**Subj: re:winterlight ideaDate: Oct  7 06:33Do me a favor, when you do bug/idea/typo reps that pertain to an item, please use [winterlight] so that the filename will show up for us.  I don't know the path or anything about it, so I can't find it to make mods.  Thanks :)  -Earwax **"
