There are a few reasons for this kind of system, including \n(and of course not limited to): guilds to be thematic additions rather than \nrequirements for chars to be feasible; a standardized system lessening the \nneed for complex combat code in guilds, allowing the coding wizzes to focus \nmore on content/theme than combat stuff; standardizing simply gives us a \nbetter system to work from, more consistent from guild to guild, while not \nlosing variety - we should gain variety since simply changing a few tricks \nand spell names won't cut it anymore; this kind of system will be extremely \naddicting for new players as they will SEE their characters improving  \ndramatically right from the time they start playing - seeing your skills \ngoing up over and over is very addicting, trust me, it's the key to any \nsuccess DragonHeart MUD has enjoyed, and was part of the appeal to Mal's \nWarrior guild.  Another advantage to this is that it rewards players for \nactually killing stuff rather than hitting behind someone, as the majority \nwon't trigger unless the player is taking hits; yet another advantage of \nthis system is that it opens up a variety of ways to play even a guildless \ncharacter (\"Adventurer's Guild?\") - they can wear medium armor and focus \nmore on dodging/parrying attacks and using counterattack, or they can wear \nthe heavy gear and use shields for shield block/bash. \n \nThe skills will be reliant both on attributes (which will be undergoing a \nrevision as well, to make them more important, and less uniform from char \nto char), and usage-based raising.  There will be two basic categories: \nautomatic, and initiated; automatic being skills that the game attempts to \nuse automatically, and initiated being ones that the player has to type a \ncommand to use.  They will be on a percentage basis as well, with 5% being \nprobably the minimum.   \n \nSkills (of both varieties) will be raised automatically, in a manner similar \nto Maledicta's Warriors, or more closely, to the system in place on  \nDragonHeart MUD.  The skills will have a % chance to happen, and when they \nhappen, a % chance to improve: higher chance at lower skill levels, low at \nthe higher end.   \n \nSkills will also have prerequisites.  For example, riposte (counterattack) \nrequires parrying a blow.  Because of that, the powerful counterattack  \nability will take much longer to max than the parry ability.  There will be \nadvanced skills as well - for example, enhanced dodge, which requires the \nregular dodge skill to be maxxed. \n \nSorry for the spammage, but there was a lot to cover.  Keep in mind that \nthis is the absolute first draft, it requires a lot of fleshing out in  \norder to code, as well as having the attribute and race revisions already in \nplace.  As much input as possible is critical in designing this sytem, so \nplease, formulate some opinions and mail them to me, either on here, or to \ndhalek@comcast.net.  Thanks. \n \n-Earwax \n\n**\nearwax\n**\nSubj: Nirvy reward point stuffs\n\nCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,mokri,pavlik,fakir,sparrow,angel,khrell,brittany,tristian,rumplemintz,linus,yumcha,mosobp,stardream,martha\nDate: Aug 21 07:09\n\nI've finally redone my writeup, after having lost the file somehow \nand throwing away my hand-written notes.

The problem looks to be that when using an \nFTP program you have to transfer files in ASCII mode instead of  \nbinary mode.  There should be a button you can click or something \nin the options for it. \n \nIt doesn't show up on just lore more <filename> but if you use the  \nmud editor you'll see that it puts a ^M at the end of most of the \nlines. \n \nJust switch it to ASCII re-transfer them and I think you'll be good. \n \nFred \n\n**\nmokri\n**\nSubj: mob error\n\nDate: Jun 27 16:07\n\nIf the file you were having issues with is: /players/mosobp/areas/BATTLE/NPC/android.c, \ntry changing line 41 from: \n  \"#MN# screams loudly as he moves forward in a swift motion driving\\n\", \nto \n  \"#MN# screams loudly as he moves forward in a swift motion driving\\n\"+ \n \nYou have the last character as a comma (denoting the next argument), when I think you want a + (appending the next line to the current) \n \n-mokri \n \n\n**\nangel\n**\nSubj: fix file\n\nCc: fred\nDate: Jun 28 02:16\n\nHello, Mosobp \n    I sent you a fix file in ur open \nIt covers ur NPC's and OBJ's \nI'll get to ur rooms later. \n                   Angel \n\n**\nangel\n**\nSubj: heal\n\nDate: Jun 29 09:47\n\nhey, \nthe quickest way for a mob to heal is set_heal(5,5); \nof course you modify the numbers for amount and \nfrequency............. \nas for the ac thing I'll get back with you. \n                            Angel \n\n**\nfred\n**\n Re:   the mob heal\nCc: fred\nDate: Jun 30 08:51\n\nYou cah cneck out /open/fred/scarf.c to see an example of a scarf that ihas \ndifferent AC's dewith a factor or check on it. \n \nRight now it checks for which guild is wearing it.

I cleaned up in \nyour area so the file are no longer the same  \nas what you have on your computer. I kinda feel \nbad cause I think I did not quite explain spacing  \nas well as I should have.  In /open/vital/doc/ \nhe has a style doc that explains it well. you can \nread is you want, would be helpful.  What I think \nyou should do is create a new folder on you computer \nwith crimson ed and move all your files here to there \nand review the differences in spacing to visualize \nit and I had placed an example in you fix file, but \nyou were not consistent in each room some had 2 spaces,  \nsome were 4 and others were 8. It is important that \nall file have same info in the same place and keep \nthe same spacing.  \n     I also added Videl and Krillen into a room. \nmove them if they are not where you want them, but \nmake sure to use the new files to edit... \nIts 11 am here I will not be back on till prob \nafter 5pm. \nASK any question needed.

Whereas \nI think that this is a cool ability, and I don't know what he had \nto pay to purchase this ability for his clan, I didn't like the \nfact that he could create one in the Village Green. \nAs far as I'm concerend, these walls should only be able to block \nmonsters or pkers. Normal players should be able to pass through \na door in the wall or something. Major disruptions in gameplay \ncould occur with walls being set up in the main village spine. \nKrylos was setting up a trap in case Heinous logged in, he  \nwanted to keep him from making it to his clan hall before he \ncould attack him. I'm fine with that, it just blocks everyone \nelse too from getting to the shop, advancement, post office, \nanything east of the green. \n \nPK areas are open game, but I feel this should be changed a  \nbit. Let me know if I'm out of line here. \n[Sparrow] \n\n**\nsparrow\n**\nSubj: Area Approval\n\nCc: Angel\nDate: Mar  7 23:17\n\nMosobp, \nAngel has been trying to contact you about your area approval. I was informed \nabout an unkillable mob in the area, Garlic Jr. For some reason every heart \nbeat you are calling the heal() method. Inside this method it checks to \nsee if the hp<500. If so it heals 400hps. This effectively makes the mob \nunkillable. You need to either limit the number of times Garlic can heal \nor remove the heal completely. \nPlease correct this ASAP so we can move on with approvals. We appreciate \nAngel doing approvals in Star's absense but we seem to have hit an stand- \nstill. Once you have it corrected please contact Angel with the changes. \n \nIf we do not hear from you soon we will suspend the approval for this  \narea and move on to the next one.

I didn't see anything wrong \nwith krillen.  I copied him to my dir and tweaked a few things and his \nexp value went from 120 to 230k.  I changed wc to 50, ac to 28.  Upped \nthe heal rate to 35,4.  Changed the first spell to be 25% chance and made \nit hit all alt attackers. \nit hit all alt attackers. \n \nI think he wouldn't be a whole lot harder to kill and he is worth a lot \nmore exp.  It seems like the heal rate change had the biggest impact.  I \nwill have to play with this more. \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: piccolo\n\nDate: May  1 01:45\n\nOK, added heal_check spell which calls your function, which is basically \nwhat you had in HB before.  Changed the function to add a spell to do the \nroom damage spell, \"energy_burst\".  This spell calls a function after it is \ncalled which removes the spell.   \n \nI tested it as Dragnar, but you would need to test it with a testchar to make \nsure you are getting the 125 other|energy damage when he heals.  I did verify  \nthat he heals twice and no more.  I got the message for the energy_burst \nspell, so I think it should work. \nspell, so I think it should work. \n \nSince the energy_burst spell is removed, I added a wc_bonus.
