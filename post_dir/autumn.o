I'm tired of being the topic of discussion and i'm really tired of it all happening behind my back.  Somehow the things I'm confiding in people i trust are getting all around the mud.   I blame a lot of people for that - but mostly I blame myself.  To make a long story short, I've got a take it or leave it attitude. And right now I'm leaving it.   Talk at ya later. **worm**Subj: heyaDate: Aug 25 13:50heya  ) **worm**Subj: sorryDate: Sep 28 10:33didnt see ya. :hope things are going well on your end. saw semi recent pics, you look very happy. :) **"
