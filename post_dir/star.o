The reason to use force() instead of just calling the function is so this_player() will be correct when attack() is called. Not sure what's causing the bug, specifically - probably the attacker object isn't getting properly passed to the weapon function.  This won't really be fixed until there's a better way of implementing additional attacks - something else I've been looking into but haven't done anything about yet. **mizan** Re:   Somethin from WormCc: starDate: Oct 16 10:55Thanks for the message... I have been ignoring Josh at this point, even blocking him from IM because of obvious reasons. This is something he spewed on channels early this morning...  Worm ( player 19+100 ) has entered the game. Worm gossips: the day you guys want a game back, just hit me up. Worm gossips: seriously, you'd let it all sleep away.. over the chance of some woman scaring ppl off? honestly? im disappointed, i think you're all smarter than that. Worm gossips: i can start and end it.. she couldnt do @^@% compared to me. ever. period. Worm gossips: she lies? dont we all. she cheats, heh, ive never done such a terrible thing. she drives players/wizards off? why are they back again? seriously? because the game is/was Worm gossips: i've let you down.. you've let me down Worm gossips: give it 1-2 more months. its gone Worm ( player 19+100 ) has left the game.  With 'friends' like him this game needs no enemies. -tij **mizan** Re:   Somethin from WormCc: (To: star) starDate: Oct 16 10:55Thanks for the message... I have been ignoring Josh at this point, even blocking him from IM because of obvious reasons. This is something he spewed on channels early this morning...  Worm ( player 19+100 ) has entered the game. Worm gossips: the day you guys want a game back, just hit me up. Worm gossips: seriously, you'd let it all sleep away.. over the chance of some woman scaring ppl off? honestly? im disappointed, i think you're all smarter than that. Worm gossips: i can start and end it.. she couldnt do @^@% compared to me. ever. period. Worm gossips: she lies? dont we all. she cheats, heh, ive never done such a terrible thing. she drives players/wizards off? why are they back again? seriously? because the game is/was Worm gossips: i've let you down.. you've let me down Worm gossips: give it 1-2 more months. its gone Worm ( player 19+100 ) has left the game.  With 'friends' like him this game needs no enemies. -tij **highlander**Subj: heal scrollsCc: (To: boltar) star,angel,illarion,mizan,shinshi,fred,vertebrakerDate: Oct 19 21:29i just had 5 full heal scrolls get destroyed in my casa room.  is that supposed to do that or what.... get back to me please with resolution if any. thanks **shinshi**Subj: orbDate: Oct 20 09:51/players/mizan/logs/snoop/orb **rumplemintz**Subj: AFKCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,vital,angel,khrell,sparrow,star,mizanDate: Oct 28 12:23I'm switching jobs so I might be away from the game until I get settled.

In the dir /players/mizan/opl/generator are the tools i am currently coding/messing with to create the realm I am working on which is essentially just a giant, randomly generated maze.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/generate_maze.py is some Python code which currently is hardcoded to build 100 x 40 sized text mazes. The #'s are navigable areas, while the periods are no-man lands. It can be executed on a system with Python installed by invoking 'python generate_maze.py'.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/compile_maze.sh is just a little script that saves human-readable output of the maze to file, and also makes a copy which has no line breaks.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/process_maze.pl is then the perl code which actually builds up the .c room files which are all stored in /players/mizan/opl/CELLS. My code as usual is not formatted very cleanly because it's a work in progress. Essentially in this file, I read the output from compile_maze.sh, and iterate through all the rooms. I am basically counting exits- if I see dead ends, I randomly put a monster or something interesting in it. If I see intersections, I crowd them up with monsters that 'block' them. Things like that.  Additionally, here is something which may be of great interest to Verte. http://iceyboard.no-ip.org/dg/ This is an instant town generator, written in PHP. The code is available at http://iceyboard.no-ip.org/dg/?source=1  Also, a cave generator which I found lives inside /players/mizan/opl/generator/cave shows promise, it just needs some tweaks so that certain passages always remain 'open'.  I'm no expert on this stuff, it's been a bit of here and that tinkering for me so far. Go nuts. -tij  **sparrow** Re:   Stuff i have been working on which may be useful to othersCc: (To: mizan) vertebraker,boltar,vertebraker,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,sparrow,angelDate: Feb 23 01:33Thanks Miz, I've been looking it over and I dig it. Just a note of something  that I've been wanting to do: Encounters. I've talked to Miz and Verte about it and I think it is very promising. Right now it is still in the planning stages but with Verte on board it should be moving forward rather soon. Here is the quick and dirty: Instead of cloning a monster, the room will load an encounter based on the level of the party leader. An encounter master daemon will be cloned to run the encounter, moving the party to a 5x5 room arena. The master will then build a list of npc's and distribute them throughout the arena. The daemon will keep track of the locations of the npcs as well as the players. The room long descriptions will actually request locations of the npc/player parties and display a map showing the location of each npc/party member. Npc's will be tagged with different roles such as Tank, Caster, Support and Ranged. A seperate daemon will take care of AI for the different  roles. Tanks will charge into battle, supports will buff and heal npcs, casters will cast spells (duh) and ranged will rain down projectiles as long as they are not engaged by the player party members. Also, players with ranged type weapons will be able to enter the same 'RANGED MODE' which will allow them to target a npc on the map and deal damage (albeit minimal) each round as long as they are not engaged directly. Experience will be handed out once the encounter is completed (no exp if the party flees) and treasure will be generated as well. I know this is very ambitious but I definately know it is within our ability. Ideally I think we should build it in a way that any wiz can use it, and customize it to his/her tastes with some sort of config file.  Like I said this is just in the planning stages but I  would like to get as much input on it as possible. I think this would help with the issue of players grinding in the same areas, for the same gear, and I've never seen this type of system on any other mud. Sparrow, the Scatter-brained Idea Machine **boltar** Re:   Stuff i have been working on which may be useful to othersCc: (To: sparrow) mizan,vertebraker,boltar,vertebraker,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,sparrow,angelDate: Feb 24 20:10   I like the idea of making the rooms variable and keyed to who goes in them. if can be done that sounds like an excellent idea to make  things much more interesting.  **illarion** Re:   do_special() and armor strikesCc: (To: vertebraker) boltar,vertebraker,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,sparrow,angelDate: Feb 24 21:47Rather than simply blocking additional calls, what about making them less and less likely? First call always goes off, second is if(!random(3)), (33%), !random(6), !random(12), !random(24), etc **sparrow** Re:   do_special() and armor strikesCc: (To: illarion) vertebraker,boltar,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,angelDate: Feb 24 22:47I am with Illarion 100% on this.

Whereas I think that this is a cool ability, and I don't know what he had to pay to purchase this ability for his clan, I didn't like the fact that he could create one in the Village Green. As far as I'm concerend, these walls should only be able to block monsters or pkers. Normal players should be able to pass through a door in the wall or something. Major disruptions in gameplay could occur with walls being set up in the main village spine. Krylos was setting up a trap in case Heinous logged in, he  wanted to keep him from making it to his clan hall before he could attack him. I'm fine with that, it just blocks everyone else too from getting to the shop, advancement, post office, anything east of the green.  PK areas are open game, but I feel this should be changed a  bit.

I had to do this one other time in the past (oddly enough also at his request) and what will hopefully happen (again) is that he will come to his senses and ask them to be restored again.  Poor kid. He needs some serious help, and I think I make a very poor surrogate for real psychiatric care. I have no doubt he is going to scream for a little while and make a stink, but i've tired of coddling him of late. In fact all of the players have been putting up with him too. He's going need some 'tougher love' for a little while, and then when he asks for his characters back we'll probably get a few more months of humility and  relative peace again.  If anyone has a better suggestion/solution I am all ears :)  TL:DR - Hawkman threw a fit, wanted me to delete his chars.

Just thought I'd give you a heads up.  -Symb **rumplemintz**Subj: RE: Shojiro has an odd issueCc: fred,boltar,mizan,shojiroDate: Jan 21 11:56After extensive looking, it appears that Shojiro quit the Vampire guild when he had 46372829 exp. Leaving that guild incurs a penalty of 1/4 exp (among a bunch of stat losses as well). 46372829 / 4 = 11593207 And 46372829 - 11593207 = 34779622  (or level 19 +44) When he Suicided, it dropped the max 2 levels to 19 +42 - which is 32000000 XP.  Hope that clears it up.    -- Rumplemintz **jason**Subj: inventory issueDate: Jan 23 14:28so here is what my inventory looks like to me   ->> i You have a small gold star tattoo on your inside right ankle. You have 0 PKs, 9 deaths, and a total of 0 Legendary PK Points.  Autoloads:      A symbol showing unmatched honor (held).      A Consistory Seal (worn).      A Power Ranger Communicator.      Your PK Tracker.      A hotel key card.      Mark of the Samurai.      Iron Death Blade.  You are carrying 6% of maximum capacity. ->>  Autosaving character... time  Display: Thu Jan 23 14:25:49 2014 CST The clock shows 8 hours 20 minutes 40   this is what it looks like from wiz perspective  I jason You return from being afk. Jason's inventory. ROOM: players/boltar/casino/hall3x1 0       obj/soul#4173 INVIS 1       players/mokri/clans/object#4182 A symbol showing unmatched honor (held) 2       players/angel/masons/mgob#4181 A Consistory Seal (worn) 3       players/guilds/Rangers/HonorRangerCommunicator#4180 A Power Ranger Commu nicator 4       players/pain/NEW/items/star#4179 INVIS 5       players/snow/closed/test/aura#4178 INVIS 6       players/earwax/closed/TRACKER/obj/tracker#4177 Jason's PK Tracker 7       players/boltar/casino/key#4174 A hotel key card 8       players/vertebraker/guilds/samurai/gob#4171 Mark of the Samurai Done. **dragnar**Subj: Walking DeadDate: Feb  6 11:59I'm done!
