Last time I logged out, I'd made sure my room was locked, and i typed list a minimum of two times, as I always do, to make sure i stored it. what can I do to get it to come back? Is there a room update command or something that can make it restore? just curious, because I've seen this happen once before but I don't remember how it was fixed. if you could let me know what I can do i'd really appreciate it, there was alot of hard-to-get equipment in there. thanks! f Muerte f **chip** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 04:07really? you don't snoop players chatting? then it's so funny how you knew the things my templar said to Earwax about a matter dealing with your templar who was on at the time, you drunk egotistical worthless fucking jackass. I think wax's ideas are going to be a huge improvement for the mud and will bring a much larger Pbase. only people who may find him a dick are the abusers/grievers/cheaters. so which category shall you place yourself in? take a pick, heh. no one needs to hear your whining when you're never even around to give any of it solid structure. find something better to do than bitch about things you're not even getting yourself involved in. if you don't like how things are, don't bitch. change em. which means come here more regularly. i've not found thing one wrong with the projects Earwax has proposed and begun. and i'm quite sure in my own mind, being a long time player myself, that this mud needs an admin like Earwax to weed out the weak and the whining. and if you're so heartbroken that the  mud will be doing so well here in the very near future just because you won't be involved to get recognition for it, then maybe you should be dewizzed. i personally will not be expecting recognition, for i'm not able to be involved due to heavy hitting life circumstances. tho, I'm not bitching either, because the place i have called home for over 10 years will continue to be home and a nice one at that. i just wish we could get more wizzes like Wax, Verte, Bolts and Fred around here. and as soon as humanly possible, i'm hoping to learn tons from all 4, Wax especially. Chip - Apprentice Developer (learning) **boltar** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: chip) zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 13:37  All,   If you have something to say, say it to me. I don't want this   insane bickering back and forth.    PS. Don't CC the world on every rant unless you want me to think  you want to start trouble by getting everyone fighting.  **"
