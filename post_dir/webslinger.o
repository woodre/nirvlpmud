To join just go to the old guild entrance room.  If you seriously don't know where it is then tough nuggets!  Ask someone cause I'm not sure of the exact directions atm.  I just know how to get there =P.  Fred **fred**Subj: FixesDate: Apr 18 08:29Well I might make it so you can change your login to either the church or the ghall but in general loging in while the church bell is ringing won't matter.  The bell only hurts if you're changed into your symb.  If you haven't changed yet it won't affect you.  Fred **bleh**Subj: heh, good nightCc: (To: sephiroth) mosh,webslingerDate: Apr 26 05:40view 2006, top party list, had a decent night maybe might try to break it on thurs, mebbe not, i should be coding **"
