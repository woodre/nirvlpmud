After you get an understanding of the Hagakure, you will understand what the guild is based upon.  If/when you decide to join the guild, write an email to Valen,Claude,Tirnok & myself - the reason you want to join the guild and you can add the asset you would bring to the Samurai. :)  I hope this helps.  Cya soon! **dragnar**Subj: mail nietzscheCc: **Date: Sep 29 20:58You like the Ninja Turtles I coded? :) **"
