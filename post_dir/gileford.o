messages "alexis**Subj: Your ApplicationCc: khrellDate: Nov  8 20:41Mortal, I have reviewed your application, and find myself impressed by both your courage and your candor.  I wish to interview you to determine whether you are indeed as interesting as you appear to be, and more importantly, to determine whether you are one that I would accept as Family.  I can make myself available between 9 and 11 pm EST on  Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, or between 9 pm and midnight on Friday or Saturday nights.  If you will  mail me with a date and time that you are available, I will meet you here and we can talk.  Perhaps I will bring another of our Family to meet you as well.  Until then, Mortal, may the dawn find you safely home. Alexis, Belle Morte **"
