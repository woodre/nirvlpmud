I do not know if this letter will find you at home or not. I will be here no later than tomorrow evening around 9pm est. and perhaps as early as 11am est. I will check in in the morning to see if you are here and if not then I hope to find you in the evening. Hallas is very eager to see Aislin again, but I think his boyish eagerness could not out do the passion of my desire to once again hold you in my arms and feel your soft warmth against my body. Farewell until I may once again gaze into your perfect eyes.Yours and yours alone,Legolas**legolas**Subj: To Aislin, from HallasDate: Jan 13 00:29My dear, when you find this, I will already have gone. I could not wait to see you before riding but I could not go without leaving you this. Please do not be afraid. I go because I must to save us all. There are elves still in the woods and I must find them. If all goes well I shall return at the head of an army. Yet still, it is dangerous to try and slip through the enemy now that we are besieged. Know that I leave my heart behind with you and that, should the worst happen, I would count myself blessed to have spent my last days of life with you who have opened my heart to love and saved me from dispare. Should I fall, I shall await you on the other side. My love always, I shall return.With love always,Hallas**cartham**Subj: missing youDate: Nov 23 00:13say just wanted to drop you a note to let you know the world seems a bit darker without you in it.**legolas**Subj: ExplanationCc: AingealDate: Jan  1 13:25Dearest Feyth, I must appologize for disappearing. It was not intended. I owe you an explaination and that is what this is. I am in graduate school now, working on my Master's. I am working for the school and living there for convenience and financial reasons.The server at the school blocks a number of online games and this is one of them. Thus, I have had really no opportunity to get online and explainmy absense until now. I just thought you ought to know what became of me. I am still on AIM. My screenname is Gwalcavad, if you ever desire to talk. I miss playing with you a great deal and I am sorry I was unable to tell you what happened for so long. Yours ever, Legolas **mortarion**Subj: My absenseDate: Aug  5 00:51A'mael, I have taken leave of the tower for a time, do not worry, I am fine.  Blysse does know some.  I shall return on the eve of Sun's day.  I hope this letter finds you well... I shall return to your side.  -Mortarion **jareel**Subj: healersDate: Jul  5 20:09Healers Healers have the short end of the stick in the EXP department this really should be addressed. The way it works now. Healers Gain No xp in combat* *-Exception-If the healer is in a party with other players they gain around 10% from killing Mobs Healers Gain EXP from healing players This was designed in a 19+21 world.  The EXP gains were developed when the best you  could be was +21 this is no longer the case. Max level is 19+100 or is it now?  No we really have no max level so as a player the  incentive to "PLAY" a character should be around.  The fear of dying should not be so intense that a player does not want to take a big risk like playing in Mizans OP area  because gaining 3 million EXP will take 2 years This is the life of a Healer.   Healers Have some problems or some special spells that make then unique...I have a  solution that may solve the the healer problem. Healers Should gain 1/2 xp in Solo combat(Not in a Party), as of right now a new  healer has no real way to gain levels.  This will maybe give them an incentive to  play and a way to gain levels at a reasonable pace. In a party out of combat as long as the healer is healing other players in the party  the healer should gain the party exp they would be allocated as any other player  would be allocated. Healers in Combat to nerf the invincibility Healers have as a tank if they are fighting  should Infuse themselves when they heal themselves in combat.  This will fix the problem  of the the healer being invincible in pk (as with the element of air) As a side note.  I think the healers should have a spell like Smite if they are EXPing in SOLOCOMBAT mode.  Maybe just at the level of a fireball but it would give them the choice to heal or cast a damage spell and use mud heals like any other guild.  This  would put the healer guild on a lower power level than being guildless but with cooler I Still think Healers should gain exp from healing other players but with the shrinking player base even with the recent resurgence this is not enough for a healer to survive on completely.  (If we keep this solo should be half, if we remove this solo should be full abilities. x **"
