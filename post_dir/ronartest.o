It hurts me that you chose to mindlessly trash talkme for no reason, other than to 'placate rick' and just go with the flow.What kind of bullshit is that?In my simple definition of what a friend is and is not, you simply don't qualify.Now i don't expect you to sing my praises to Rick/Hogath and convert him to theHigh Church of Mizanism, but simply going along and agreeing with him about howmuch of an inflated ego freak i am is not what friends do with other friends."Do you see where I am coming from?"So on that note, please fuck off. And if this place annoys you so much, pleasedo us a favor and not come here anymore. In case you haven't noticed or figuredout, i'm not pissed because of the snoop or privacy issues here, i'm disappointedin you since i did nothing to harm you, and you seem to get some enjoyment takingme out. I dont care if this place has 0 active wizplayers or not, but life is entirely too short to be dealing with ditzy backstabbing cunts like you.Thurber's Corrolary: "Anyone who makes an argument on a public server about the                       importance of privacy has automatically lost. Period."G.R.-miz**"
