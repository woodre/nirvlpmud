Hoth monster 4w from green clones many copies sometimes, same with cockroach. Some bugs say some of these mobs are aggro? 3. Want to take a look at the shardak guild? Use the bugs command, there are a few listed. THanks! --Gnar aka John **jareel**Subj: AreaDate: Sep  2 13:46Mobs of Note in Area Chandra Rogar MObs of Note in Spire /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageUnderware	 .c      /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageRing6	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageRing5	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageRing5	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageRing4	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageRing3	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageRing2	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageRing	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMagePants	 .c" /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageNecklace	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageMisc	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageGloves	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageEarring	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageCloak	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageChest	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageBracer	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageBracelet	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageBoots	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageBelt	 .c /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageAmulet	 .c /players/jareel/monsters/LUNAR/CraterMaker/Solaris.c     NewItems:      /players/jareel/armor/cratermaker/solaris/ArchMageArmor.c /players/jareel/SoulboundObjects/ARMOR/SetOfShadows/GuardOfDarkness	 .c /players/jareel/SoulboundObjects/ARMOR/SetOfShadows/MiscOfDarkness	 .c /players/jareel/monsters/LUNAR/CrimsonBat/Grailion.c     NewItems:      /players/jareel/SoulboundObjects/ARMOR/SetOfShadows/BracersOfDarkness.c      /players/jareel/SoulboundObjects/ARMOR/SetOfShadows/ArmorOfDarkness.c /players/jareel/monsters/LUNAR/CrimsonBat/Braklan.c /players/jareel/monsters/LUNAR/CrimsonBat/hendron.c /players/jareel/monsters/LUNAR/CrimsonBat/Jillios.c /players/jareel/areas/chaos/woods3/spire.c....spire4.c /players/jareel/monsters/STORMBULL/Rogar.c     Items      /players/jareel/weapons/stormbull/ROGAR/ChaosAx1.c      /players/jareel/weapons/stormbull/ROGAR/ChaosAx2.c /players/jareel/NEW/WEAPON/healerstaff	 .c /players/jareel/monsters/CALANAARROY/Chandra.c     Items      /players/jareel/SoulboundObjects/ARMOR/DemonCloakBinding.c  /players/jareel/areas/chaos/woods3/wood1.c....wood17.c  **jareel**Subj: if that doesnt formatrightDate: Sep  2 13:48/players/jaree/areas/chaos/woods3/MAPTEXT.DESCTEXT.IDEATEXT **"
