Marry Roy if you fucking want because I hate the fucking asshole. Anyways, I still sort of care about you so actually DON'T mud marry him because he will probably just use you to get back at Kira. I still like you but...bye**fenfir**Subj: SOrryDate: Apr 25 22:24I'm reallly super sorry about the comment i made to you the other day, it was totally inappropriate.  I play a very evil character here but I mean this honestly as a person.  I don't wish to drive any new players away from here at all.  if you ever need some help I'd love to help you, regardless of what people say about me I won't kill you or harm a hair on your head now that I know you really are a new player here   I don't want you to become dependant on me but if you need help here and there I'll be there.     Sorry about the comment, totally rude and inappropriate.      ****houndog**Subj: heyCc: byeDate: Jun  2 16:19hey baby what up. umm what u been up to, do you know viper/billy/mark? email me i might call you soon.
