I can in fact bring you into the Rangers and get you started. The only thing i ask, is to finish getting your stealth to 20 (yours is currently 8 and it helps as a ranger), and get int, wil, pie, and cha to 10 each (stat costs for those lower points are minimal), and to get to a total of 1,090,000 saved experience points, yours is currently just under 657K. I don't say that to be picky, or to be an ass  nor do I say it to make it harder on you. Having that much or more exp saved to start off with as a Ranger will make being a fresh ranger MUCH easier, especially when no one is around to help you out. The less experience you have to start off with as a new Ranger, the harder it will be to do anything. New Rangers I've seen who started with no saved up experience, always ended up quitting playing the character, or the mud completely, as it was just way too hard. Skarekrow, me, Deathseeker, or m ost other rangers should have no problems helping you get the other 440K or so experience you need to get a good start. Just let them know I requested that they lend their aide in getting you there, unless i see you on to get you it myself. Skarekrow can contact me anytime outside the mud, so let him know when you've finally got it done and i'll be on the first chance i get to get you started. I look forward to seeing a new face in the guild! Talk to you again soon hopefully! Best of luck! Sephi **"
