I wish to seek this power you have discovered and learn of it.  Before you are quick to dismiss my claim, please listen to me. I was once a powerful ArchMage, my tower, or what remains of it, resides in the Isle of the Magi,  you are probably familiar with the terrain, since it lyes close to the Templar Castle.  One day I was searching some old scrolls that I had come across searching the hills near the Creasant Lake when I stumbled across a scroll that spoke of unimaginable power in the Dark arts. As I studied the contents and spells that came to me in deep medication while trying to 'connect' with this Dark power.  The Knights Templar realized the power I had tapped into and grew very jealous, and in their fear they opted a  holy crusade upon my land, deeming all it's inhabitants, heritics, and sentenced everyone to death by 'purification'. Clearly, you will not find any of these words I speak of in any  Templar text, for this is a dark stain upon the cross they wear around their pretenchous necks.   Which with your help, and my diligant studies and piety, I wish to rip from their bodies.  I work hard, and learn quick, I offer respect when respect is due, which only comes to the one more  powerful than I. Your humble serveant, Arcanarton, of the Isle of the Magi. **"
