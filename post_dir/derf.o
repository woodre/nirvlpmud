messages "aingeal** Re:   more jailCc: mizanDate: Sep  9 18:39I have spoken with Mizan, as well as reviewed the logs he kept.  I asked him to release both Happy and Handy from jail, and he isgoing to comply with my request immediately.  My decision to haveboth characters immediately released is based upon a finding that youdid not technically break any rule that should result in imprisonment.However, some of your conduct is rather disrespectful to some ofthe wizards here, and they clearly do not appreciate that.  You havea right to express your opinion (within the confines of the rules), andI would never suggest that you should not do that.  On the other hand,you may want to look for ways to express that opinion that are a bitless antagonistic, or this is likely to be an ongoing struggle betweenyou and the wizards you tick off.  Please try not to push their buttonsquite so much.  *smile*  If there is any further friction between youand Mizan (or any of the other wizards), please let me know andI will do what I can to fairly resolve the issue.Aingeal**"
