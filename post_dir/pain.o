One who will 'fix up' the guild so that we can at least compete with other guilds. We have always been quite a bit weaker than other guilds but now that other guilds are growing more powerful and getting revamped and with the new stats, we are far from competition. Many of us find it sad because we love the guild and we have made much more sacrifice than other guilds have and we have much less power. I and many other dervish wish to be updated, some of the small bugs fixed, perhaps extra skills or powers, all the while maintaining the wonderful theme of the guild. We all have lots of input and I'd like to nominate Fred as someone. I have talked to many wizards and done lots of footwork for this and ust recently was told to mail you. I appreciate you time and any efforst you may produce. Please do not shut us down and tell us that we don't need a new wizard or any updating for we are, believe it or not, outdated. Like I said many of us dervishlove the guild and the theme. Dual wielding is a great power and I don't think we need much more spells if any, perhaps just a new set of skills or attributes that will incoporate the theme, while improving our fighting ability or perhap defense. I much appreciate the time you spent to read this mail. Mail me back and tell me what your thoughts are and if I should mail my request to anyone else.

The idea is to keep all of the little day-to-day stuff away from Boltar so that he has time to do thethings he needs to do here.  The system allows serious problems orconflicts to be brought to his attention, but at the discretion of one of us.I've placed the proposed system in each of your open directoriesunder "prison" for your review.  I tried to use a bit of commonsense in who to ask to serve in the decision-making capacities,based on who appears to be here and available the most.  However,if you are not willing to do this, please let me know and I'll asksomeone else.  Additionally, if you have any suggestions on howto improve the system, please let me know -- I haven't posted anythingor made any changes to "help prison" yet pending feedback from you.Wren and I also thought it would be a good idea to keep a copy ofall written decisions (which must be mailed to the interested partiesunder this system anyway) in one common directory so that any of us canaccess them at any time.  At the moment, for lack of a better placeto put them, they can go in /open/aingeal/decisions.  At some point,we can certainly move them somewhere else if we choose.Thank you so much, and I look forward to hearing your feedback.Aingeal**aingeal**Subj: Area approvalCc: (To: katya) painDate: Mar 23 14:57Katya,I've finished my walk-through on your Bolivar / town area.My list of corrections and suggestions is in my open directoryunder /open/aingeal/approvals/katya.c.Once you've made the changes, please contact Pain, who will reviewthe area for balance and do final approval.I enjoyed seeing your new area!

To me, the key that opens that door is a set of well-executed help files in combination with an informative newbie school. Nirvana is fortunate to have a helpful newbie school/tome. In order to retain those newbies and provide an ever building knowledge set for more experienced players, I feel that the help file system would benefit from a thorough examination and clean up. This would provide a professional, helpful, up-to-date and complete help file system that would be an aid to all players. In light of that, I propose the following plan: -A complete inventory of all help files available in the game,  checked for relevance, misinformation and completeness. -The creation of help files for commonly asked about game facets and important in game issues. -A re-grouping and arrangement of the indexes to better reflect a natural learning progression as well as a more common sense grouping system. -Creating a more aesthetic, polished interface that is both visually  efficient and consistent. -Performing a similar analysis of the web page help files, checking  for completeness, accuracy, and consistency with in game help files. I have already completed a fair amount of research, comparing available information with questions asked by myself as well as other players. I am very aware of the thin line that exists between babying players and providing them with the tools to play effectively; I feel that with the right approach player ingenuity and culpability for their own gaming experience can be preserved without sacrificing the needs of newer players. I would not expect to be able to change whatever I want at will, but I do hope to work with more  experienced wizards to set limits that are appropriate and beneficial for all involved. **brandi**Subj: okDate: Jun 13 17:44Ok thank you and there will be nothing said on my part,as I have told tou, I tellblock blade and darkfyre assoon as I come into the game.I thank youBrandi**llew**Subj: Bug in monster.cCc: (To: boltar) pain, llewDate: Jun 17 22:13set_armor_params() in monster.c does not set the armor_class value if it iscalled twice.  I discovered this when I called set_ac() twice in a monsterand used a negative ac_bonus to make sure the exp value of the monsterdidn't increase.  The exp value was decreasing because of the -ac_bonus.Since calculate_worth() in living.c uses armor_class to determine value,it was messing up.

This is something that I have wanted for a long time, but real life took me away for a while.

I left Nirvana during the new mud debacle, and also coded there. I am notproud of this, as I know I disrespected both Boltar and Nirvana, and showed a great lack of respect to the playersof the mud, which neither Boltar nor the players deserved. Earlier this week, I explained to Boltar how sorry I wasabout this. Though I coded there, it has been about 5 months since I been there. I believe I was led into some untruths, and also told partial truths. I listened to people I shouldn't have - and I did a stupid thing by leaving. I haven't a desire to code on that mud. I do however have a desire to be a wizard here. Even through all this, Nirvana still feels like home and has been greatly missed by me. I know that I will probably never be a senior wizard hereagain, nor will I ever gain the level of trust that thecollective wizardship had for me in the past, but I do knowthat I can be a productive wizard on Nirvana. I'd like tomake ammends and atone for the way I left Nirvana. I'd like to code areas that the players can enjoy.That being said, Boltar said he probably wouldn't have a problem with me re-wizing here, as long as I got some approvals and found a sponsor. I know how to code, and Iknow most of the rules here - I'll of course need a refresher, but I could be creating almost immediately.I know it is asking a lot to put your faith in someone that left in the manner I did, but I promise that I will do my best and never again betray the mud. I will work hard on improving my area and making fun here on Nirvana.If you could find it in your heart to approve me for becominga wizard again on Nirvana, I would appreciate it from the depths of my soul. I would not let you down.Thank you for your time, I look forward to speaking with youabout this.Forbin**eurale**Subj: earwaxCc: euraleDate: Jul  8 18:58Earwax and Mosobp in conversation... :(Earwax's History71: 'check your mail72: 'sent it from my yahoo account so it should be there fast73: grin74: 'i assume i don't need to say it, but don't spread it around hehe75: 'i didn't write it, was given to me by someone76: 'i keep meaning to overhaul it tho, add mobs to it, add exp value ranges, notes, etc77: who278: 'what i'd like to do if i had the time is write a database for mobs and items79: 'slap it on a website, and a few people like you and bone could add to it, peruse it etc80: 'we could have the perfect information source81: snicker82: who283: who284: l85: IR earwax86: 'you'd prolly not believe who gave me that file to begin with87: 'can't find the one cerberus sent me, which was just the mk mobs88: grin89: who290: who91: 'it should help you some tho92: 'the same mk mobs that you know, for sure93: who294: who95: 'need to find the new ones96: 'the other mobs are just mobs97: shrug98: 'i didn't write the list99: 'i want a comprehensive list at some point tho with exp values and shit like that100: 'so we could use them to make exp routes**ribbit**Subj: Neosymbiote PatchingCc: (To: boltar) painDate: Jul 15 07:04Boltar,When my neosymbiote character was restored, his skill levelswere set at zero, and were not patched.

I have no objections to him being 21 and provinghimself, just wondering what the deal is.**fakir**Subj: forbinCc: (To: boltar) pain,eurale,sandman,fred,jaraxleDate: Jul 22 20:48I think the deal was...Forbin had to find a senior willing to 'sponsor' him again more or less. Apparently, Pain is willing to do that. I will also agree to 'keep an eye' on him when I am around.  I think he honestly feels bad about what went down, his part in it, and wishes to redeem himself and code here again.  If Pain had not put him to 21...I was going to eventually anyhow. I would not be surprised to see Mal wanting back next....but that I would NOT approve of under any circumstances....(my personal opinion).  Personally, I'd like to see Forbin make some major contributions before getting any higher levels over and above 21.  And for the foreseeable future...deny him any directory access other than his own.**boltar** Re:   forbinCc: (To: fakir) pain,eurale,sandman,fred,jaraxleDate: Jul 22 23:06 seems fine to me. The banned for life are the core:mal,reflex,and dar. beyond that is a case-by-case basis.**eurale**Subj: forbinCc: (To: fakir) boltar,pain,sandman,beck,jaraxle,fredDate: Jul 23 10:23I agree with your assessment of Forbin.  I too think he regrets being led down aprimrose path by Reflex and his herd.  I also agree with not letting those thatare banned 'ever' have a good enough reason to return here as a wiz.  As long asI'm at it, I believe there are some lower level wizzes that need watching aswell.  Just be vigilant and watch for things that seem 'out of place' for a wizat low levels.     -E**roubaix**Subj: Possible Bug/ReimbursementCc: (To: jaraxle) forbin,fred,fakir,eurale,painDate: Jul 23 17:03I have noticed what appears to be a bug, and would like to bereimbursed if possible.  I am hoping that I can have 1,238,711 experience added to Roubaix and have his level reset to 19+5.  At thetime of my buggy death, my experience was 3,738,711 and I was 19+5,and had a Strength of 30 and Will Power of 20.  After the buggy death (which includes dying twice), I am now level 19+1 and my experiece isnow 2,500,000.  My Strength is now 29 and my Will Power is now 19.While in Jaraxle's area, I was in the Dark Pyramid and attacked theLingering Spirit (/players/jaraxle/3rd/pyramid/mon/spirit.c).  Whilefighting it, I wimpied to the exit room.  After I exited, the spellattack from the heart_beat() hit me, killing me, even though I wasnot in the room.  If this was an intended effect, so be it, but I think it is just a bit of oversight.  I have noticed several wizardsuse the heart_beat() method of spell attacks - but some, includingmyself, forget to add     if(present(attacker_ob, environment(this_object())) to the heart_beat() attacks.  Monster.c uses the above method to makesure that people not in the room do not receive spell attack damage,so I would assume that it should be checked for in heart_beat()attacksas well.  I've noticed the same or similar checks in Zeus', Jenny'sand Wocket's work to name a few.To compound my problem, as I tried to retrieve my corpse, from theLingering Spirit room (which I thought had killed me), I was killed asecond time because I had actually been killed by unknown, so huntinghad not been reset.I am asking that the experience/level losses from both deaths berefunded, as I believe the first death should not have occured, andif the first had not, I doubt I would have been killed by the huntingreset problem.I have included a log of the battle, deaths, obit notice, and a tail of /log/DEATHS located at /players/forbin/closed/bug.txt.Thank you for any help,Roubaix**fakir**Subj: black circle guildCc: (To: boltar) pain,vertebraker,x,Date: Jul 27 17:30I am concerned about the black circle guild. Have not had time to look it over, and don't know who did...but they are going up in huge levels...and in pk...seem to be extreemly powerful.

Chant, a player char of Jareels, agreed to give a level 19 player char to another player as soon as it was leveled up. I have a complete log. This, even if it was only discussed, is a clear violation of the rules for players here, let alone the wizard seconds.  If any one has questions, you may certainly ask for clairification.

Scathe / Noirceur talked smack at you,and it appears that you were talking smack at him as well.  Frankly, I believe that the entirething was very childish.  If you do not like my decision, you have the right to appeal it, ascontemplated by our dispute resolution system.  Feel free to appeal to one of the appellatewizards, and I will gladly abide by their decision.  The very fact that you blame the processwhen the decision does not come out the way you wish, and that you further threaten to "deal with it your way" the next time "it" happens confirms the report I received that youwere a contributing factor in this verbal exchange, rather than an innocent victim in termsof the attitude you displayed at that time, and at the time that you received my decision.  Again, I urge you to appeal the decision if you wish to do so.  Understandthat if another incident arises, and if "handling it your way" results in a violation of therules, you may be subject to the same sanctions that anyone else would be in thatsituation.  To be honest, I'm disappointed in the behavior of everyone involved in thisincident.  I will cc this mail to Pain so that he will be aware of it in case you decideto appeal my decision to him, or to one of the other appeals wizards.Aingeal**puppy**Subj: approval requested Cc: puppyDate: Dec  4 19:42I would like to add cyber heals for use in the guild arena only.

I believe that I have thought of everything (I know it's been said before) a player could do to get the heals out of the arena or use it for cheap healing.  A few things to point out are as follows.  -The two arena exits check a players invt for the heals and destroys them before allowing exit.-A player must be fully healed before entering the arena.  -If a player dies and disconnects for any reason there login is changed to morgue.c.-All heals disallow sending, selling, putting in containers.Feel free to find me if you have any questions.  ThanksPup**mizan**Subj: moadeep, part 7Cc: (To: aingeal) pain,mizanDate: Dec 10 16:27The weather forecast for today is... more rain.I realize that a lot of people on here do not like moadeep,but they for the most part have been leaving him alone andavoiding confrontations upon request.Today, howdy's mudkid was killed by fzendatu, which prompted him to set hisPK and try and chase fzendatu down.

Hopefully those of you can look past your misconceptions of me and giveme a chance to show and create my ideas.Khrell**puppy**Subj: access to the mini guildsCc: (To: boltar) pain,sandman,vertebraker,puppyDate: Jan 31 22:22I was thinking that I wanted to create a canine mini guild (just fur my own amusement.)

So of course the box disapeared. My idea is that to make a list of players that could pick up and open my box, so if I lets say say that whoa can pick up my box, she can, and she can open it. Each player could set a list of players, or just one player who could pick it up, or remove a person from a list. In this way, the gear in the box is not lost and it can be returned.**tallos**Subj: CompletedCc: (To: jaraxle) vertebraker,pain,eurale,beck,sandman,fakirDate: Apr  6 13:50After many years of playing on the mud with several different  characters I have finally completedthe quests required to become a wizard.

There were several problems withhow you set it up that violated the established policies forcoders on Nirvana. The original workroom was either directlyor indirectly aimed at extending your command set beyond thegroup of commands indicated for a level 21 coder.This is your warning. If you make any attempt to circumventthis by uploading other copies of workroom or transplantingthe code into a tool, you will be demoted.If there is no command to do what you want to do in wizhelpthen don't attempt to do that action.

A highly recommended read is in/open/mizan/sep_05_2004.txt.In a nutshell, Fastkill was caught today logging in as Moby (Billy).When confronted, he lied about it. The ensuing carnage resulted inmost of Fastkill's chars being reduced to L1, as well as Billy and Moby.Largely because of both player characters general ignorance and stupiditythis was allowed to happen. Vertebraker did a lot of the heavy lifting todayand i am thankful for both his and Forbin's help. The sep_05_2004.txt filegoes into much greater detail, it's about 3K long.Fakir was witness to my first interaction with Fastkill, and can fill anyonein on the generally benign level of it. After catching him two more timesover the week trying to do the same thing, my patience wore out. Verte hungin as well, until it reached a point that nothing really good was goingto happen.This was sent just to fill everyone in, since it was a fairly crazy run-and-gunsort of situation.

There is no rule against stealing equipment from otherplayers.  In fact, some players role-play evil and/or opportunistic characterswho would steal from their own mothers, given the chance.  Muerte appears tobe such a character.  It is unfortunate that Hula lost his equipment to a thief, butMuerte did not violate any mud rules in stealing equipment.  (I'm sure you'reaware that corpse stealing - with all the equipment and coins attached to saidcorpse - is common in some guilds.)  I'm sorry, but I do not have the authority,or the desire, to punish Muerte for his conduct in this instance.

I am talking weapon, armor,or item type gifts, similar to bug rewards.  I could be assimple as a game weapon that is just +1wc or an armor thatis +1ac or has a special defense, or it could be a totallynew item coded specifically for the given player.

I would lean more toward the stock sideof items to offer, perhaps with a bit more customization as they gainsome of the larger levels. I would suggest a semi-preset short and longdescription that can have changes made to color or perhaps a space forthe name of the player or the item, without making the whole descrip-tion custom. I fear some of the copy we are likely to generate from afree-for-all in the descriptions.Bah, ignore all that. It would all just fall under the venue of playerpre-titles and descriptions.

Well to set the recordstraight i categorically deny any smear campaign about you and am notthe evil fuck you have made me out to be in order to keep you from wizzing.What i have done however is the following.1) Told senior wizzes that you have an elysium wiz char (entropy). This is  something you told me yourself, remember- and as pretty much everyone on   here in the wiz ranks knows, elysium is not exactly a friendly   mud to this place. There is standing documentation and rule policty   about people who choose to keep active wizzes on both muds. At least on   Nirvana, you really should not be maintaining an active wiz char on   elysium. 2) That being said, i did make fun of the sample code you sent me once in   mail. Look, i'm freely admitting that. You sent me something that   has lots of ANSI graphics but no real substance whatsoever in terms of   an innovative monster that utilizes logical structures and algorithms   to do something interesting. Cases in point, would be Boltar's reproducing   squirrels, or that shithot monster in Forbin's realm that mutates.So say what you will if you consider point number 2 to be characterassassination, but i categorically deny any of the things you have been tellingother players (me doing a mailin campaign to stop you from wizzing as oneexample) and the changing of your ranger color to 'whine'. Again, i denied thatand it is addressed in another mail that was sent to tyr and boltar.This is just for the record, for those of you who may be reading.I love taking the credit or blame for things i have done but want no partin anything that does not involve me.

Max for each stat will be 30, to conform with current standards; each race however, will have different maxes for each stat, with 30 being the ceiling.  Stats will be more in control of a char's power than level, but they gain stats through levels and xlevels.  Currently I don't have anything planned for gaining stats in any way other than level, although that may change.  strength:     damage bonuses in combat, carry capacity dexterity:    chance to hit in combat, dodge, parry, skills etc constitution: hp, hpr (regen rate), endurance points, epr willpower:    innate resistances, willpower type checks, has an effect on ep mental:       sp/spr, int/wis checks  racial, static stats: they either don't change, or aren't controlled by char: luck:      they can 'roll' this stat at char generation charisma:  also roll this at char generation, within limits set by race size:      this will go up as they level, until they reach their max size            also a rolled stat  Specifics:  HP: 10* con + 2*level + 2*xlevel      7  con at level 1  means 72  max hp - higher than now     30 con at level 19 means 338 max hp - about equivalent to now  SP: 10* men + 3*level + 3*xlevel      7  men at level 1  = 73      30 men at level 19 = 357   EP: 7*con + 3*wil + 2*level + 2*xlevel  HPR: racial modifier + con hp regen per minute, max of 60 SPR: racial modifier + men sp regen per minute EPR: racial modifier + 2/3 con + 1/3 wil  current stat checks will be routed to the most appropriate stat  Implementation: these won't go fully into the game for general players until this stuff has been thoroughly tested and races, gear changes, skills are ready to go in as well, but they will be the first in for testing. **salina**Subj: Ok, so to do a little bit of advertising, I made a nirvana myspace site.

If you wish to know what I am talking about, read some of the mails he has sent me.  Personally, I like the mud the way it is. I don't want to change it. I have no intention of dancing to some tune Earwax feels like playing on his flute. I do not, nor never have abused wizard powers. I occasionally snoop a player, but never when two players are in a room or chatting. And, I usually (almost always) tell a player if and when I am snooping them and also when I turn snoop off.  Its absurd that Earwax even brings that into a conversation about being a wizard.   Personally Boltar, I am sick and tired of his heavy handed way of dealing with things...and it's my opinion you are going to have a dead mud very soon because of it.  I will not tolerate someone who threatens, cajoles, and is otherwise a dick.   It is true I do not contribute to the mud much, other than the areas I did code and are in play.  However, I have never seen my contribution here to be one of code.  Wizards come and go...power hungry, unstable wizards have come and gone.  In almost every case where there has been an abuse of power, or a lack of good judgement, I have had a hand in resolving that issue...in some way or another.  And, I might add, you have usually backed me up in most of the disputes I have had some involvement in.  I don't really care what Earwax does. I do not have the juice, nor the time, nor really the interest anymore to try and corral his over-bloated ego...I suspect that issue, if its dealt with, will have to rest with you. apply sphere to being a wizard here...I've had a good run. I have enjoyed the game, and enjoyed for the most part the people I have met here.  If the current gestapo Earwax does indeed have his way and dewizes me, so be it.  Even though he feels otherwise, I still think I contribute something to the game...but as always, I will leave that up to you to decide. I am way too old and way to long in the tooth here to care much what some bully wizard dictates to me as being 'his way or the highway'.  Do you really want someone like this in charge of things to the point you give him THAT much authority?  Vert NEVER had an ego like Earwax. He NEVER abused any wizard power. He never, once he became a wizard, cheated the game. I cannot say the same for Earwax.  There is a WORLD of difference between Vertebraker and Earwax as far as Admin goes.

I don't really care about what he does or says, and I have encouraged other wizzes not to provoke him by even responding to anything he has to say. Yes. That is my official stance. Just flat out ignore him no matter how irritating his words may be. Don't bother him, don't help him, don't hinder him, just ignore him completely. But let him speak.  I know it sounds counter-intuitive but I encourage you to do the same, and even spread the word about it to others if possible. Delorean may be a griefer and a selfish little twit, but he has a right to login to this game and play.  In the past I have not been as saintly and approachable either, and I recognize that. In the past I have done things like delete his characters or siteban him and it has not changed his behavior. When I returned to here a few months ago,  I made an offer to start off with him on a clean slate. I believe I have held my end of the bargain. However he has chosen not to. But I'm cool with that.  Rather than wipe him off the MUD i chose a different vent for dealing with him. I made a comic which features some of his antics, of which there are two episodes so far visible at:  http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/a-barycentric-griefing-motion/ and http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/the-third-fastest-thing-in-the-world/  Again, I encourage others to simply ignore him, and let peace and contentedness be in your soul rather than pure rage that (insertDeityHere) has forsaken us and left us such a miserable little shitfucker to suffer with. Delorean and his kind are a vital part of this MUD's ecosystem, as we need diversity... strong PK'ers, roleplayers, socialites, coders, whining douchebags- We need them all.  There is a saying in Arabic which does not translate well, but I'll try- "I let my enemies dine at my doorstep because it is my pleasure, God willing." So paraphrased my take on that is: "I let Delorean play here and speak what he wants because it is my pleasure."  So you know what to do. The next stupid thing he does, mudmail me a transcript and I will credit you appropriately on my next comic strip(s).  Thank you for reading. -Miz **"
