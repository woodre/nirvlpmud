I am pretty sure all chars lately have a vampire, you will just have to ask around really..

Just let me know what all is going on..  Bella.  **boltar** Re:   vampire guildDate: Jan 13 21:27 I changed  I changed vamps a long time ago so that bites saved over boot  -Bp **lamont**Subj: dewdDate: Feb 12 01:38dewd it is i Lamont and i am ready to join the family **"
