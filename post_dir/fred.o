The problem is the mobs that have it are super hard to kill. Dreadbane has died multiple times getting a single set. And I see this gear on pretty much everyone. So, I created /players/dragnar/closed/mob which inherits from monster.c but does some logging if the mob is killed or dested. I then changed Jareel's mobs to inherit from my file instead of monster.c. It writes to /log/GNAR. Just letting you know in case I find something and we have fallout to deal with. **shinshi**Subj: CharmDate: Oct 13 19:30She wants to see if, as an extra prestige bonus, they can choose one attrib to keep for good  **dragnar**Subj: Guild codeCc: **Date: Oct 14 22:48Sorry, sent this to Rump and forgot to cc you: I've had 2 people ask me for access to guild code in the past week.  Both of them just want to view it offline. Do we have any rules on   this is or is it a case by case basis?                               .                                                                    Puppy wants to look at the cyber code. I know he worked on cybers    in the past. Mode wants the Fallen code, he said zeus gave it to him a long time ago and he lost it.

I noticed the  following line the warrior wc bonus code, why would warrior wc bonus be based on stealth when it looks like it should be dex? dexmod = USER->query_attrib("ste"); . Any clue? **dragnar**Subj: Login BonusCc: shinshi,sami,wicketDate: Dec 22 09:55I've had this idea every since I did prestige, and I want to work on it soon. I would like to give the players a prize for logging in on a regular basis. I was thinking daily and weekly prizes. Feel free to mail me ideas on what the prizes could be.  . Some idea I already have are gold, casino chips, heals etc. I also have some unique scrolls I have been working on for an upcoming area. They give unique 1 time abilities that raise your wc bonus, give a double xp, bless armor/weps, make any weapon unbreakable etc. I was thinking about using these for some of the bigger prizes. . Let me know any thoughts ideas you have. Thanks, --Gnar **careen**Subj: shucksDate: Jan  7 21:54Charm kicks her foot in the dirt and says Ahhh Shucks!    something like that! thanks! **dragnar**Subj: weeksCc: (To: rumplemintz) fredDate: Mar 31 09:34I want to give a login bonus to players that login frequently. I may do a daily login bonus, but I want to focus on a weekly bonus based on some measurement of actually playing, possibly getting a % of exp for your current level or something. . . Do either of you have any suggestions on how to keep track of the weeks? **dragnar**Subj: namesCc: **Date: Apr  9 20:08What is the rule on character names?

It loops though the bag and deposit the total gold in the bag (and destructs it of course). Can you guys test it out? Kinda late and this is the kind of change I want to make sure is right. Thanks. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: DarudeCc: **Date: Jun 29 12:12OK so here is what he did. Those mobs don't heal, he got their health low while he was +100. Then he prestiged and after he leveled up a bit he went back and finished them off. Obviously not in the spirit of prestige, but I don't think we have a rule for this. Unless we apply character separation to before & after prestige? --Gnar **malt**Subj: zordCc: dragnarDate: Jul  8 15:33fred my zord seems to be bugged it says none space zord and it is supposed to be a velociraptor **shinshi**Subj: /players/shinshi/healers/spells/heal.cDate: Jul 25 19:33I can't figure out why it's displaying the message twice.

I found some code that Earwax started awhile ago for nirvana rewards that was never really used, so I am using what he started. . For the login rewards, looking for your feedback on the award. I'm planning on doing 5000 * the number of weeks. So week 1 you would get 5000 reward points, if you consecutively get week 2 you would get 10k. If you miss a week it breaks your streak and you start over. So if you logged in 52 weeks in a row on the 52nd week you would get 260k. I'm also looking at doing milestone bonuses for month, 3 months, etc. . When a player exchanges rewards for cash it will be at a 50% ratio. 10k rewards points would be 5k gold. Casino chips will be 1:1. Other items TBD. . Let me know what you think. I want the rewards to be big enough for the players to care about them. But if you think they are out of line let me know what you suggest. Thanks, --Gnar/John **brak**Subj: MaltDate: Aug  9 17:38Malt again. Seems he decided Tank's wait period was over today rather than tomorrow as posted on the Globe. Thus, Tank has not waited the full week.  - Brak **malt**Subj: recruitmentCc: ~sDate: Aug  9 17:56i recruited a ranger early only because i had intended to post him to the board 3 days prior to that but had issues where i was getting wifi. was not an intentional breech of rules. **dragnar**Subj: login rewardsCc: **Date: Aug 18 13:21Hey Fred, Login rewards is done. I updated the old traveler w of the adv guild for the players to be able to use the rewards. Can you take a look and let me know if the items/prices looks ok? /open/info/room.c Unique items that I added are: /players/dragnar/SevenSpires/scrolls/wisdom    - double xp /players/dragnar/SevenSpires/scrolls/acuminate - make weapon unbreakable /players/saber/stuff/lr_mbag                   - storable bag Thanks, --Gnar/John **charm**Subj: hiDate: Sep  3 22:59hey i am soo sorry for falling asleep...you had a bad day and i wasnt here to listen to you.. i hope you have a good Sunday....i hope your day goes better... sorry about your neighbor and i really hope your wife finds her necklace.. hope you sleep well *Charm* **dragnar**Subj: Elemental TestCc: **Date: Sep  9 14:41Do you know why this change was made? [Aug 11 2015 05:19] Illarion: A: updated the etest so it can only be done once per reset Thanks, --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: FredCc: **Date: Sep 16 15:32Don't tell me you bought a Fred? --Gnar **dragnar** Re:   FredDate: Sep 17 07:50You said you always name your characters after something you recently purchased. Yeti etc. so I'm curious where Fred came from? **dragnar**Subj: Armor breakingCc: **Date: Sep 21 15:20Is there any reason players are unable to repair armor?  I know some mobs break armor on the player.  Samurai can only reapir weapons, same with the smith in town. Did it just never get added? **vertebraker**Subj: Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: dragnar) darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Sep 27 22:27Guys,  I think it would be a good idea to remove sponsorship requirements from guilds.  For example, mages, samurai, shardak, etc.  Since the player pool is so small, I feel there is no point in having the requirement of waiting for someone else to login in order to enjoy 25% of the content of the MUD.  Any objections?   **oberon** Re:   Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: vertebraker) dragnar,darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Sep 29 19:01I think sponsorships are an interesting aspect.. I'm not sure if I like seeing it deleted all together. So, as an idea, what if we keep sponsorship alive on those guilds but add a mob that will sponsor somebody for 80k coins. Now you have a way for people to buy it, or do it for free if a player is on.  - Oberon **rumplemintz** Re:   Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: oberon) vertebraker,dragnar,darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Oct  7 14:01I like the idea of the coin cost, as it's insanely easy to coin up these days anyway.  I do agree that it should be changed. **dragnar**Subj: Rangers commandCc: **Date: Oct 11 11:32Hey Fred, the viewing globe is bugging out in the Rangers guild hall. When you type the 'Rangers' command it bugs on Whitehawk. I find it interesting that he prestiged and hasn't yet re-joined the guild. I couldn't find anything wrong with his .save file. I'll copy the debug.log into your home dir in case you don't login today. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: room.c Cc: rumplemintz,shinshi,sami,vertebraker,oberon,darkfire,mosobpDate: Oct 18 21:59I always liked the way some rooms that had call_outs in them shut them off when no players were in the room. I finally got around to adding the functionality to room.c.  You can use the new: set_call_out( string co, int interval, int rand_interval )  to set the name of the call_out function, the interval and random interval. . In the inherited room you do set_call_out in the reset, then define the function that will be the target of the call_out. I'll put an example in /doc/build/room/call_outs. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: padCc: (To: darkfire) fredDate: Oct 26 07:44pad("~", 40, '~') Will make a string of ~ 40 chars long. The last character will default to a space if not given. This is a simul_efun. --Gnar /obj/simul_efun/pad.c **gizmo**Subj: Class Advancement in ShardsCc: noneDate: Oct 27 19:48Would it be possible to be moved to a higher class position in the Shards? **linus**Subj: Bone (one of my chars)Date: Dec 10 07:59Tried to log on as bone to restore inactivity and got a sensitive mind error. is this something you can look at and hopefully fix?  :) thanks **"
