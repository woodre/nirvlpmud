messages "blood**Subj: two issuesCc: (To: fred) pepeDate: Feb  5 01:41heh, it's Seph. i just logged this character in and his guild object, too, is gone. i still log into fallen lands and all, and my guild name still lists as fallen, but i have no object anymore. also, my Poly, Blackstar, has an issue with a couple of his stats from a death while he was morphed as a tetrapod and even though he autoreverted, that stat or two still stayed at 1 rather than being up where it/they were. i'll talk to you about it more once i see ya on again. later bro, take care. **"
