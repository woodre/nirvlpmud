I watchedit happen with a snoop tool that Mizan gave me(logged the action with wlog) and it appearedto me to be a trigger.  I could not prove itconclusively so I let them off with a warningand told them not to abuse the invite commandagain.  Both, of course, claim that they willbe appealing this and my 'harrassment' toBoltar and Eurale, hence their presence in this mail where I would never normaly botherthem with this trivial crap.Vartanian, for the record, is Scathe's playercharactor.  Flood is a second charactor ofCerberus, who was just jailed for triggerstwo days ago.  If anyone catches Kaleia/Summeror Flood(or any of his chars) using triggersor even suspects it, warnings are out of thequestion at this point, they all know better.Any questions, just ask.-Reflex**daranath**Subj: Area approval...Cc: daranathDate: Aug  7 21:28hey Wren   I took couple of mins to look over your area.

I think the current system is rather nice. It takes the edge off that we used to have with the knights not setting and gets the flappers on their toes more often. The main complaint I heard was that thissystem was primarily financially draining. Which led to players hiding their coins in the motels. So then win or lose the victorsdon't get anything more than a few heals. Though come to think of it, I've noticed that some of the pkers are being more generous about returning corpses after a fight. So I think it creates a bit more comradery instead of just competition....which we need here.ah, back to idea. I was thinking perhaps to give it a little edge back, and to decrease some of the flap about shear quantity of pks under beltto quality perhaps we could add some sort of a bounty system. Base on lvl and number of pks with a couple other random numbers that would set a coinor credit value on a pker. with a mercenary guy somewhere to trade a token from fight or somesuch for either the coins or items of some kind. andjust now thinking of it once treasury/trophy rooms are installed in clanhalls people might choose to display the victory token instead of cashing it.I dunno if this would be feasible or not, i'm not real sure how much cash motivates the pkers. But bragging rights seem to. Perhaps this could be a miniguild thing too, dunno. I had a couple of those in mind but dunno where to start. Anyhow, I've not slept in longer than I should have but the damn coffee from breakfast(supper really) has me wired. I'll shut up now.later, --Wren the dementedPoly GC and maybe someday senior or guild wiz...muhahaha**vertebraker**Subj: bugsCc: novowelsDate: Aug 14 00:56Entertain me with a list of polymorph bugs and so forthand I'll probably fix them.**dune**Subj: questDate: Aug 30 17:30Hi Wren, I just finished my changes to my quest by the way.No more shards, Eternity, nor decree.

After having left/kicked from the Shardak guild, Blade joined polymorphs again.  I did not think this was a just thing considering he has stolen from your guild hall repeatedly.  Toughguy and I were both witness to him doing it one time where he stole everything from your tug.  Toughguy left the Shardak alliance because of it.  I was just thinking that it does not seem just that he should be allowed to stay in your guild.  Your guild is for happy, funny, good people as I've heard you put it.  He none of those.  He is a thief.Dakeyras**boltar** Re:   coastlineDate: Jan 15 21:46It's in!**toughguy**Subj: BladeCc: summerDate: Jan 16 13:14WrenSummer,I have noticed that Blade was stealing out of our guild lockers (Tuglist).Unfortunately I didn't catch him in the act, BUT, I did see items missingand checked the local, well know shops, and seen the same items in there.I have also noticed that he frequented our guild room at times upon login.As a high member of the polymorphs, and hopefully a respected guild mate,I request that he be removed from our guild forever. I don't want to beassociated with a thief.  We do have some guild members that ally with certainguilds for favors in return, the Shards are one of them, and they kickedhim out because of this.  THere were more, but this played a big part. Ifyou have any questions, please ask me, or even talk to Rek.

The idea is to keep all of the little day-to-day stuff away from Boltar so that he has time to do thethings he needs to do here.  The system allows serious problems orconflicts to be brought to his attention, but at the discretion of one of us.I've placed the proposed system in each of your open directoriesunder "prison" for your review.  I tried to use a bit of commonsense in who to ask to serve in the decision-making capacities,based on who appears to be here and available the most.  However,if you are not willing to do this, please let me know and I'll asksomeone else.  Additionally, if you have any suggestions on howto improve the system, please let me know -- I haven't posted anythingor made any changes to "help prison" yet pending feedback from you.Wren and I also thought it would be a good idea to keep a copy ofall written decisions (which must be mailed to the interested partiesunder this system anyway) in one common directory so that any of us canaccess them at any time.  At the moment, for lack of a better placeto put them, they can go in /open/aingeal/decisions.  At some point,we can certainly move them somewhere else if we choose.Thank you so much, and I look forward to hearing your feedback.Aingeal**puppy**Subj: The only thing that I would add is something about players not coming back on as someone else after being jailed and spamming over a public channel about the imprisonment.

However, some of thesesame wizards are engaged in PK, and occasionally usetheir wiz character to use ip or who2 or whatever theyneed to find the intended target of their pk-player..This is obviously an unfair advantage.  My recommendationis that we illegalize multiplaying with your wiz andyour player during PK altogether.  Some also use inventorychecks, stat, etc to boost their chances in PK.  Withall these wizards floating around, I don't think this isan unfair request.				verte**coldchain**Subj: RevivalDate: Aug 28 02:55Having Spuck revive us from deathIs a bad idea because the monster will still attack you after you die, I died to some strange monster that killed me from 200hps, a 20k mob, and when I came back I almost died. morph times are a bad idea too. don't know why those got implemented**icarus**Subj: ApologyCc: ShadowraithDate: Aug 28 03:35I apologize for my actions regarding those 3 members of the dark order, I was throwing a temper tantrum and not being myself and totally stepped out of character.

I have been swallowed upon entrance to a room 5 times in a row, which may not be a bug but after tickling out I lose my coins and gear. Which is not a bug I understand, I'm a veteran of the jello. BUT after killing a sarawak my coins are just gone, 40k just poof, gone. Doesn't make sense. and B: After tickling out sometimes when I return to fight the sarawak, minute I enter the room the Sarawak and I engage in battle again like normal, but the Sarawak does no hit back. Also on another occassion the borg cube zapped me which I thought made you quit out and drop all your stuff if I recall. Correct me if I'm wrong, but for some reason I just lost half of my equip and didn't quit out and lost my party object *boggles*. It shot my gordie stick and eweapon, both were kept at the time so I don't know if that is creating bugs.

A highly recommended read is in/open/mizan/sep_05_2004.txt.In a nutshell, Fastkill was caught today logging in as Moby (Billy).When confronted, he lied about it. The ensuing carnage resulted inmost of Fastkill's chars being reduced to L1, as well as Billy and Moby.Largely because of both player characters general ignorance and stupiditythis was allowed to happen. Vertebraker did a lot of the heavy lifting todayand i am thankful for both his and Forbin's help. The sep_05_2004.txt filegoes into much greater detail, it's about 3K long.Fakir was witness to my first interaction with Fastkill, and can fill anyonein on the generally benign level of it. After catching him two more timesover the week trying to do the same thing, my patience wore out. Verte hungin as well, until it reached a point that nothing really good was goingto happen.This was sent just to fill everyone in, since it was a fairly crazy run-and-gunsort of situation.

I just dont think he should advance past level 40 for a long time..until he proves himself again...should he come back to his senior wiz status..i say no to that...but yes to his return.  Trist. **earwax**Subj: Armor shitCc: (To: zeus) wocket,feldegast,pain,jaraxle,eurale,beck,jenny,pestilence,puppy,wren,martha,gemini,angel,jamila,catt,star,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,mokri,sparrow,rumplemintz,aquila,lacar,quicksilver,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,catacomb,hair,veeshan,haywire,skie,sampson,y,chax,lisheDate: Mar 29 02:39I'd like you all to give me some feedback on this shit, just send me a reply to it....basically it involves a HUGE fundamental change to the mud, but one long overdue, i (and many players and wizzes) feel.  Basically, instead of all guilds, all players, using same gear  essentially, and everything being max ac, weight 1, with specials,  this will create a lot of diversity, especially considering that the guilds can be made to utilize the changes very easily.  The file to look at is /open/earwax/armor.txt  Just send a reply, not reply all, or post, I'll be sharing all feedback with the other admins and whatnot.  This is a major deal, so please send your feedback.  -earwax **"
