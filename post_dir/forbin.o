I was certain I put them both on inactive status, as I had the rest of my characters on.  Is there any way to retrieve them?  Roubaix was a level 19+ maxed necro, and Casper was (if I am right) a Knights Templar.  If there's no way to get them back (i.e. they are lost forever), no worries.  Just thought I'd ask and find out for sure. Thanks, Forbin  Thanks, Forbin **doodle**Subj: Fantasy Football?Date: Aug 14 16:52You up for some fantasy football this year? I'm commishing it and haven't seen ya around in a while. Let me know if you catch this and I'll send ya the info. eat fruit **rumplemintz**Subj: LDCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,illarion,fred,vital,forbin,francesco,pavlik,angel,mokri,sparrow,fakir,ludlum,leatherneckDate: Sep  3 11:04LD looks pretty stable and from what I can tell it's probably ready for players.  When do you think we will make the move and change it so 3500 logs into LD and enables save_object on playerfiles?  Should we have a week of logging into LD as a test, and if they want to log in and save, they can go over to LP on 3535?  I'm not sure how to proceed and get this thing rolling.  LD has such a huge advantage for coding it's ridiculous.  Anyway, just don't want this to get stale, so we should make some sort of decision.  --Rump **mizan**Subj: Delorean griefing on channels, and stuff.Cc: (To: boltar) illarion,rumplemintz,aingeal,khrell,star,x,pain,tristian,keeper,artos,valen,angel,worm,shinshi,sparrow,forbin,guestDate: Sep  8 21:17Hi guys, I heard about some of the stuff Delorean was spewing on channels, and wanted just to give my take on things. I don't really care about what he does or says, and I have encouraged other wizzes not to provoke him by even responding to anything he has to say. Yes. That is my official stance. Just flat out ignore him no matter how irritating his words may be. Don't bother him, don't help him, don't hinder him, just ignore him completely. But let him speak.  I know it sounds counter-intuitive but I encourage you to do the same, and even spread the word about it to others if possible. Delorean may be a griefer and a selfish little twit, but he has a right to login to this game and play.  In the past I have not been as saintly and approachable either, and I recognize that. In the past I have done things like delete his characters or siteban him and it has not changed his behavior. When I returned to here a few months ago,  I made an offer to start off with him on a clean slate. I believe I have held my end of the bargain. However he has chosen not to. But I'm cool with that.  Rather than wipe him off the MUD i chose a different vent for dealing with him. I made a comic which features some of his antics, of which there are two episodes so far visible at:  http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/a-barycentric-griefing-motion/ and http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/the-third-fastest-thing-in-the-world/  Again, I encourage others to simply ignore him, and let peace and contentedness be in your soul rather than pure rage that (insertDeityHere) has forsaken us and left us such a miserable little shitfucker to suffer with. Delorean and his kind are a vital part of this MUD's ecosystem, as we need diversity... strong PK'ers, roleplayers, socialites, coders, whining douchebags- We need them all.  There is a saying in Arabic which does not translate well, but I'll try- "I let my enemies dine at my doorstep because it is my pleasure, God willing." So paraphrased my take on that is: "I let Delorean play here and speak what he wants because it is my pleasure."  So you know what to do. The next stupid thing he does, mudmail me a transcript and I will credit you appropriately on my next comic strip(s).  Thank you for reading. -Miz **"
