Put the bowl in for about 25 mins to melt the stuff, then stir it together.  Add 1/4 cup powdered sugar, which I suggest ya sift first... stir it up nice and smooth, pour it in a 13 by 9 pan, and harden in the  fridge.  Mine stuck to the pan til I got a spatula with a tiny tip and dug under it, so ya might wanna spray the pan, but then it might taste funny. I think I'm gonna try lining it with wax paper next time... **angel**Subj: just missed yaDate: Jan 12 22:13Hey I was here just missed ya, I am in and out trying to finish off stargate.  tomorrow after noon my time I will be on and active. my mom is here spending the night and will  be leaving around then. so try me after that.      Angel! :) **tallos**Subj: color tutorialDate: May  3 14:18its done  /open/colortutorial.c **vertebraker**Subj: lacarCc: (To: boltar) lacar,tallosDate: May 16 22:27I added lacar's castle to /room/init_file **"
