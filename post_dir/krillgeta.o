My first area I'm going to make will be the town of Havre de Grace, including the heights, state park, schools (minus bakerfield), most of rt 40, the downtown area and the waterside. I'd like to get ideas and input from all of you who would be interested in bringing our beloved HdG onto Nirvana and make it the best area it can possibly be. I've got a majority of it mapped out on paper as a reference for directions and order of streets and businesses. But there's still alot to do as far as detail and setting it up to be coded. All ideas and suggestions will be taken into serious consideration, and many I'm pretty sure will get used. For all those who actively participate in this hometown pride even as I like to call it, I'll have a plaque or something of the sort set up in one of the main areas of it with the names listed of all those who help bring it together. I want it to be the best it can be, as I'm sure all of you do too. Mail me anything you think of, or email it to me at nyteshade187@hotmail.com / message it to me at http://www.myspace.com/lostminddeusesmuerte, or IM me at knockmyselfout82. And as I will be taking this project very seriously, only serious suggestions will be considered. Hope to hear things back from you guys (and girl lol). Best wishes. **star**Subj: SierraCc: (To: gogeta) krillgetaDate: Oct  1 01:34Have you talked to Sierra in the last few days?  Local time is now 1:30 AM and she hasn't been seen since 8 PM.  I think she's run off with a boy she's been all gaga for the last few days.  He's 18, and on probation.  She's been acting odd the last few days, and coming home late.  I think they've been planning something, and now she's gone.  Please..  if she said anything at all that seemed odd, or might mean something, please let me know.  Kat **worm**Subj: your cousinCc: (To: gogeta) krillgetaDate: Feb 11 14:15whats his contact info? email? names he uses most here? i have images for the Nirv FB, wanna talk to him. **"
