If you see things \nin the logs that look illegal, such as giving players coins \netc. keep in mind the logs between LD/LP are shared. Check \nwith me before you punish someone. Sami/Krillgeta/Yen and all \nof their alts are helping me test the guilds on LD. \nThanks, \n-Gnar \n\n**\nsami\n**\nSubj: check this out\n\nCc: dragnar,mosobp,rumplemintz,fred\nDate: Mar 08 00:04\n\ncheck this out, want your oppinion.  /players/sami/cyberidea.txt \n\n**\n"
