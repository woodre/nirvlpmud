There are a few reasons for this kind of system, including (and of course not limited to): guilds to be thematic additions rather than requirements for chars to be feasible; a standardized system lessening the need for complex combat code in guilds, allowing the coding wizzes to focus more on content/theme than combat stuff; standardizing simply gives us a better system to work from, more consistent from guild to guild, while not losing variety - we should gain variety since simply changing a few tricks and spell names won't cut it anymore; this kind of system will be extremely addicting for new players as they will SEE their characters improving  dramatically right from the time they start playing - seeing your skills going up over and over is very addicting, trust me, it's the key to any success DragonHeart MUD has enjoyed, and was part of the appeal to Mal's Warrior guild.  Another advantage to this is that it rewards players for actually killing stuff rather than hitting behind someone, as the majority won't trigger unless the player is taking hits; yet another advantage of this system is that it opens up a variety of ways to play even a guildless character ("Adventurer's Guild?") - they can wear medium armor and focus more on dodging/parrying attacks and using counterattack, or they can wear the heavy gear and use shields for shield block/bash.  The skills will be reliant both on attributes (which will be undergoing a revision as well, to make them more important, and less uniform from char to char), and usage-based raising.  There will be two basic categories: automatic, and initiated; automatic being skills that the game attempts to use automatically, and initiated being ones that the player has to type a command to use.  They will be on a percentage basis as well, with 5% being probably the minimum.    Skills (of both varieties) will be raised automatically, in a manner similar to Maledicta's Warriors, or more closely, to the system in place on  DragonHeart MUD.  The skills will have a % chance to happen, and when they happen, a % chance to improve: higher chance at lower skill levels, low at the higher end.    Skills will also have prerequisites.  For example, riposte (counterattack) requires parrying a blow.  Because of that, the powerful counterattack  ability will take much longer to max than the parry ability.  There will be advanced skills as well - for example, enhanced dodge, which requires the regular dodge skill to be maxxed.  Sorry for the spammage, but there was a lot to cover.  Keep in mind that this is the absolute first draft, it requires a lot of fleshing out in  order to code, as well as having the attribute and race revisions already in place.  As much input as possible is critical in designing this sytem, so please, formulate some opinions and mail them to me, either on here, or to dhalek@comcast.net.  Thanks.  -Earwax **earwax**Subj: Nirvy reward point stuffsCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,mokri,pavlik,fakir,sparrow,angel,khrell,brittany,tristian,rumplemintz,linus,yumcha,mosobp,stardream,marthaDate: Aug 21 07:09I've finally redone my writeup, after having lost the file somehow and throwing away my hand-written notes.

The problem looks to be that when using an FTP program you have to transfer files in ASCII mode instead of  binary mode.

Whereas I think that this is a cool ability, and I don't know what he had to pay to purchase this ability for his clan, I didn't like the fact that he could create one in the Village Green. As far as I'm concerend, these walls should only be able to block monsters or pkers. Normal players should be able to pass through a door in the wall or something. Major disruptions in gameplay could occur with walls being set up in the main village spine. Krylos was setting up a trap in case Heinous logged in, he  wanted to keep him from making it to his clan hall before he could attack him. I'm fine with that, it just blocks everyone else too from getting to the shop, advancement, post office, anything east of the green.  PK areas are open game, but I feel this should be changed a  bit. Let me know if I'm out of line here. [Sparrow] **sparrow**Subj: Area ApprovalCc: AngelDate: Mar  7 23:17Mosobp, Angel has been trying to contact you about your area approval. I was informed about an unkillable mob in the area, Garlic Jr. For some reason every heart beat you are calling the heal() method. Inside this method it checks to see if the hp<500. If so it heals 400hps. This effectively makes the mob unkillable. You need to either limit the number of times Garlic can heal or remove the heal completely. Please correct this ASAP so we can move on with approvals. We appreciate Angel doing approvals in Star's absense but we seem to have hit an stand- still. Once you have it corrected please contact Angel with the changes.  If we do not hear from you soon we will suspend the approval for this  area and move on to the next one.

I finally got around to adding the functionality to room.c.  You can use the new: set_call_out( string co, int interval, int rand_interval )  to set the name of the call_out function, the interval and random interval. . In the inherited room you do set_call_out in the reset, then define the function that will be the target of the call_out. I'll put an example in /doc/build/room/call_outs. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: BoneCc: (To: doodle) mosobpDate: Dec 19 13:31Mosobp let me know you were having issues with Bone. His player file looked hosed, so I looked at a backup from 2014 and that was also bad. I found one from 2012 and that one looked ok. Try to log him in, if the password is off let me know and I can clear it. If you are missing anything I can hook you up also. Good to see you back, --Gnar/John **"
