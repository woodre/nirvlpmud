Both knight commanders also didn't have a problem with that title either. So I say so I ask that vertebraker reveal his sources, if at all, and if he has none then he would be acting alone, in which the knights new objective to rule their own guild with characters would be violated. The fact that both knight commanders don't have a problem with that name makes me think that this whole thing was vertes doing. Not that he doesn't have the authority to do what ever the hell he wants on here, but he still has to follow a certain group of rules, just as wel all do.  The fact of the matter is he didn't character seperate and punished my wizard for the small infraction of my player character. This shows that this issue needs to be looked at more closely.  I would ask you Boltar please please, step in and do something about this. I've always been there for this mud, and I'm asking for your help to be there for me and look into things for youself. All i ask is that you speak with me about it after you are done.  Thanks **fakir**Subj: behavioeCc: (To: worm) boltar,vertebrakerDate: Sep  5 12:39due to your attitude, I released you early from prison.  However, you need to realize _YOU_ are not the mud. Neither am I, nor any other player here. Have fun.   **beck**Subj: RangersDate: Sep  5 13:48I just wanted to write to you with a major issue I have.  Vital has moved the entire ranger guild over to his directory.  While you may know this, I specifically told him many times that he was NOT allowed to do this. I have offered many times for his help in working on my guild, which he refused, but was VERY clear that he was not the guild wizard, and did not have permission to run it as such. Please have him revert all code back to my directories until he actually writes me mail or asks my permission. Regards, Beck **vertebraker**Subj: rangersCc: vitalDate: Sep  6 02:53Just my two cents... I thought it would be a good idea for Vital to move the Ranger directory to his on the basis that it would either eventually be copied back to Beck's directory or to /players/guilds/  The Rangers are a derelict guild, whatever Beck claims... The only reason Vital copied the Rangers is for FTP purposes. Certain illegalities and old code/balance issues neded to be investigated and there was really nobody else that was or is capable of handling the job. If no one is around to maintain these guilds, I would imagine we are supposed to intervene and do the work ourselves.. because Beck logs in every few months and checks his mail does not mean he has done or plans to do any work.  The Rangers are a problem akin to the cybers... and simple edits won't fix their powers or poorly devised system of advancement.. We attempted to contact Beck for at least the last 4 years to look into certain issues and matters which required attention and he never did. This guild has caused intense player frustration as well and the idea wasn't to claim ownership or seek its destruction or anything else that Beck would claim. Again, if the FTP was open to ftp'ing to other people's directories, I would be all for relocating the directory back to Beck's directory, however until they are more "stable" I would advise leaving them in Vital's directory... he has done a great job with working on them so far and it is unlikely Beck has complained for anything other than bitterness, not the state of the mud or the state of the guild. He has attempted to maintain a stranglehold on the guild and its problems for a while at the deprecation of the players involved in it. This would be perfectly ok, except that he has not been active for five years and has no idea what is going on with the mud these days. In my eyes, all guilds are Nirvana guilds and I would expect my code to be legalized and changed as it stays on here, and I could care less if someone copied my code to their directory as I consider it always property of Nirvana and if I am not around to maintain it, then it is the "duty" of the administrative staff.  Again, sorry this came to your attention ... I agree with whatever decision you make and I respect it, but the director modification was made only to facilitate FTP and we have had every intent of copying it either back to Beck's directory or into /players/guilds/ when it was a little more worked up and some of the issues were resolved. **vital** Re:   RangersCc: beck,vertebraker,vitalDate: Sep  6 02:54The Rangers' guild was moved to /players/vital to facilitate changes and updates being made to the code from FTP. From the beginning the intent was not to steal code or take credit for it, and you can ask Vertebraker about that. I have mentioned on several occassions that the code would not become a permanent feature in /players/vital dir.  After the changes have been stabilized and more of the code finalized it will be transfered to /players/guilds/Rangers where it can be maintained and supported by the developer community for the benefit of the guild, the players and the mud as a whole.  All of the original references to Beck's creative genius and impetus as well as his intellectual property have been retained within the source code and will not be removed.  Vital 06/09/2005 10:48 AM ... p.s. If Beck is unable or unavailable to maintain the code then under the provisions of /doc/build/code_policy it has fallen to the admin to care for and protect Nirvana. p.p.s. If Beck desires for the code to be removed and the guild shut down, then that too is also his prerogative and will be honored. **vertebraker**Subj: living / hbDate: Sep  6 04:42I patched in a heart_beat() func into /obj/living that would call attack() .. i wonder if someone took this out at some time in the past .. that way we don't have to go around updating every mob that uses living.h  the heart_beat() func is the same as the one you put in the bartender.  **vertebraker**Subj: ndml.beanos.comDate: Sep  6 22:21miz took down ndml.beanos.com recently and never responded to my emails so i assume he is still agitated. *shrug* **beck** Re:   RangersCc: (To: vital) boltar,beck,vertebraker,vitalDate: Sep  7 01:48My grievence does not stem from the fact that someone wishes to update the Rangers to be balanced with the mud, but from the way it is being done. #1 My permission was never sought.  I have not one message asking my permission to even work on the Rangers, much less move it entirely. #2 The code should have been copied to be worked on and tested fully in a test environment.  The working guild should have remained in my directory. Right now I am not able to make any changes myself, because my directories are virtually empty, and I have no idea what code has been changed and all the locations it has been affected. #3 Some changes are being done without any understanding of the spirit or intent of myself.  For instance the Ranger list, while nice and compact, now excludes my will to maintain the names of the players that helped create the guild over the last 10 years it has been running. It also excludes such important players as my own character.  My wishes are that the code be moved back into MY directory within 2 weeks. All further development is to be halted except for bugs that still need to be fixed to maintain function. I would like a documented list of all changes being made (a summary will do), at which time I will approve or disapprove them. Once the guild is running again from my directory, all proposal for additional changes may be passed by me. The guild is set up to be fairly self maintaining, but is also designed that additional code may run from other wizards personal directories, without any changes to existing code. All I ask is that this additional code get my approval before entering the game.   I am willing to work with wizards to improve the Rangers, so that it may last another 10 years, but it needs to be done respectfully. Because of the hands off approach, if I receive no mail, and changes are made transparent to my knowledge, I am assuming everything is running as planned.  In fact I would never have known of this current change had I not noticed bugs when checking the status of some normal functions. I do log in time to time to check the status of the guild, or can be reached at anytime at tearitupsports@sbcglobal.net I am also willing and have time to make needed changes myself if necessary. Regards, Beck **beck** Re:   RangersCc: vital,beck,vertebraker,vitalDate: Sep  7 02:03I will allow the code being moved to a /guild directory as long as I may still directly code it and be able to ftp to there. I also will allow it with the understanding that all changes be run by me first until the day I give the word that "its all yours". I do not wish for bad blood from this as it benefits no-one, but the lack of communication and the manner in which this was done, really raised my blood pressure. I do wish to work with you guys to make an enjoyable guild for the mud.

I have not one message asking my  > permission to even work on the Rangers, much less move it entirely.  This permission had been asked for repeatedly in the past to no avail. In your responses below you are clarifying the exact reasons why we didn't even bother contacting you this time.  > #2 The code should have been copied to be worked on and tested fully > in a test environment.  The working guild should have remained in > my directory.  This is your opinion. Extensive beta testing [Nirvana definition: having players test it] and processing their feedback is far more effective and generates more bug, typo, and idea reports than simulating with a test character in some convoluted laboratory experiment, this would be ESPECIALLY beneficial for you, since you have been completely out of touch with the mud for 5+ years.  > Right now I am not able to make any changes myself, because my > directories are virtually empty, and I have no idea what code > has been changed and all the locations it has been affected.  Why would we expect you to make changes yourself when you have been unable or unwilling to do so for the past five years? The guild is near death, and except for a few lone stragglers, it isn't even considered a viable option by 99% of Nirvana. It has been like that for quite some time. It was a poorly conceived, poorly planned, poorly coded and poorly executed guild. Your ambition far exceeded your talent. Someone has to maintain its monstrosity. This guild has more holes than swiss cheese and the advancement system and lack of player rewards other than adding lame WC and AC bonuses are staggering. What can you say for a guild that cannot use equipment in a mud where EVERYTHING is equipment-based? It means it needs to be VERY creative and VERY original. This mud in its current form is hardly that. Vital's changes are a recode very much in the spirit of the original. Your guild never really was a Niastic departure from the Nirvana experience that mostly failed.   > My wishes are that the code be moved back into MY directory within 2 weeks.  > All further development is to be halted except for bugs that still need to  > be fixed to maintain function. [cont.]  [cont.] **vertebraker**Subj: mail pt. 2Cc: (To: beck) boltar,vital,vertebrakerDate: Sep  7 02:31Why do you assume that the guild would even be fixed in 2 weeks? This is actually insulting coming from you. Should we have put a time limit on when the exp changes, dam types, or Armor/Weapon code that you failed to properly implement in the mudlib would have been ok to use? Because you did the same thing with the Rangers that you did with any of your previous work, you brainstormed up a bunch of half-baked crap, dumped it in, then pulled a disappearing act leaving everyone else to deal with the fallout of your poor thinking. You are in no position to make demands on when the heap of garbage you coded can be working properly and up to the lowest standard of tolerable gameplay. YOU ARE THE ONE WHO ABANDONED IT.  > I would like a documented list of all changes being made > (a summary will do), at which time I will approve or  > disapprove them.  Would you care to actually get back in touch with the game before knowing what would be right for the guild or the mud in general? Because you know extremely little about gameplay or how the mud even operates these days. I am also VERY against your remaining even a senior status and being able to make judgment calls for Nirvana based on your past history of dereliction, at least until you prove yourself to be anything more than a standoffish ghost wizard. You have been essentially inactive for 5+ years. Why others like Feldegast, Snow, or Mythos were stripped for being away and you were maintained is nothing less than a glitch.  > The guild is set up to be fairly self maintaining, but is als > designed that additional code may run from other wizards personal > directories, without any changes to existing code.  *laugh* Fairly self-maintaining? Do you think we are sadists? Why would we be in this situation and having this stupid conversation if your code was self-maintaining? IT IS ENTIRELY OUT OF DATE AND IRRESPONSIBLE. And nice bluff about additional code being able to be run from wizard's personal directories.... This might be fine for Cosmo's donate command, but hardly works when the guild itself needs a complete overhaul.  > All I ask is that this additional code get my approval  > before entering the game.  We tried this before, remember? Vital tried several times, we all tried to get you to allow other input on the guild. And that isn't good enough for your ego to know your code is largely crap. So you denied it. repeatedly. You claimed to fix the problems or errors in question, but a month later you vanish again and similar or other problems arise and re-arise until players quit the guild in frustration. The reason you do not receive mails is largely because of your complete non-presence on Nirvana. What is the point of mailing a ghost? If I work on Dune's guild, should I send him futile mudmails as well? Or should I just accept his lies and poor administrative ethic and pretend like he will fix the major problems in his guild. Yeah, I guess we should keep being this stupid, we've done it for 10 years. **vertebraker**Subj: mail pt. 3Cc: (To: beck) boltar,vital,vertebrakerDate: Sep  7 02:32> I am willing to work with wizards to improve the Rangers, > so that it may last another 10 years, but it needs to be done  > respectfully.  Ignoring the original creator's contributions is not something that Vital or anyone else EVER intended to do. It was also NEVER looked at as VITAL's guild now. Nirvana guilds are NIRVANA guilds. Plain and simple. If there is no guild wizard, or a guild wizard who pretends to be a guild wizard but really is just a player file and the occasional connection [such as yourself], it is up to us to maintain or rework any concepts or problems arising with said guild.  > In fact I would never have known of this current  > change had I not noticed bugs when checking the status of some normal  > functions.  Gee dood, you might have wanted to check the announcement board...             [do you even know where that is?] or communicate with other wizards...

I will of course abide by Boltar's decisions but don't try      the strong arming or the victim crap... it was your own      dereliction of your responsibilities as a coder, as a      guild wizard, and as an administrator that have caused      any situation like this to arise.

This was an administrative decision and not one reflecting any cheating or poor behavior on your part.  Your files are intact and backed up. If you desire to actually contribute to the development and improvement of Nirvana, you will need to seek out and discuss this with the senior wizards who will evaluate your readiness and willingness to contribute to the game.  Some people just enjoy being a player more and actually feel more comfortable doing that, rather than being a developer. Thanks, Vital **vertebraker**Subj: mosobpDate: Sep  9 10:15mosobp has been abusing bugs as a player .. i caught him and scolded him pretty intensely .. so if it happens again i am in favor of dewizing .. we will see if he changes his behavior .. it wasn't even the bug abuse that was annoying .. he encouraged other players to take advantage of the bug and pointed out how to exploit it .. **vital**Subj: Knights & other wizardsCc: vital,vertebraker,fredDate: Sep 14 14:29I think Jara and Khrell have done a good job thus far with the changes they are making in the Knights Templar guild. I'm not sure what issues Fakir has with them individually, but with respect to the guild, there has not been anything happening amiss as far as Fred, Vertebraker or myself can determine.  I've reassured Jara and Khrell to continue to work on the guild and document any changes they make with Verte's or one of the other seniors approval of course. They have also been instructed to make any changes that a senior or higher wizard tells them to make and to document and mail Verte and at least one other senior wizard as well.  I've watched Fakir and Jareel as players disagree with the changes that have been made in the guild, but as developers for the mud, they have forgone the right to complain as a player character. There isn't any room for wizards to create instability from within, given the information that they have and already know. This is a direct violation of the wiz_behavior rules we already have in place to deal with these problems.  I think Fakir was/is doing a great job of overseeing some of the illegal activity that players attempt to propogate, but needs to let honest development continue.  Vital p.s.

There have been a few problems that we want to address with you and we are hoping that this will lead to an overall better understand of how to proceed.  1). Code updates need to be logged in your work report. Updating something that you are currently working on [not in the game is one thing] and can [and did] have serious side effects on the overall game.  2). Desting your player characters is not a perk or priviledge of being a wizard and should not happen. There are good reasons to dest a player, but these should generally also be noted, as it often involves something else that needs to be fixed.  3). Sharing information with players is not a good idea and can often be insidious and hard to control. You really need to watch what you say and do with regards to the Knights guild and with players who are 'concerned' over the status of Mondar.  As part of this learning opportunity, we have decided to change your level temporarily to 40, pending an evaluation period not less than 30 days and not more than 60. After that time, your position will be reviewed and steps taken to either restore your levels or determine if any further action needs to take place.  Vital **vital**Subj: demotionCc: (To: mosobp) boltar,vital,vertebraker,fred,forbin,fakir,francescoDate: Sep 15 15:54After speaking with the other seniors, we have decided that you would be better off in the realm of players in Nirvana. You have trouble following the guidelines documented in the /doc/build and on the wizard bulletin board.  You have abused bugs and what is perhaps even worse, failed to report them or take steps to have them fixed. You were given a responsibility when you were promoted to improve the game and have not held that responsibility up. Coding for the game is a privilege and not a right.  If, after a period not less than 30 days, you feel like you are once again ready to contribute to the development of the game and abide by the established rules, you may contact the seniors again and petition for sponsorship again at that time. Note: There are likely to be stipulations added before any reinstatement is made.  Vital **shinshi**Subj: NirvanaCc: shinshiDate: Sep 15 20:11Vertebraker is being a real asshole lately...

This is obviously out of the hand. I went into the lib to fix it, rather than nerf individual items.  Essentially, each extra attack() has a deprecating return now. The second attack only inflicts 50% as much damage as a normal hit. The third, only 33%, the fourth, a mere 25%. This means it requires 3 extra hits to go off before they even approach the damage they are doing in one round just with one hit. For example, the Mondar Blade used to do 5 normal hits. For a wc 20 weapon, you can see that the dam can wrack up quite fast.  Another problem was Guilds getting ahold of these weps .. luckily, that hasn't been too much of a problem, but that WAS a big problem with some of the guilds that had extra stuff built into their attack() functions [like Maledicta's NeoSymbiotes, or today's Power Rangers or Dark Order]. Because these guilds had extra wc bonuses that were tacked on with attack() and were only intended to fire once per round, they guild members quickly became insanely powerful. This is also something that is happening with Bloodfist and their bloodrage -- it is just too hard to keep up with.  In any sense, this is really just a heads up that I have taken care of the problem and thoroughly tested the code. Players will notice damage drops, but it is slightly invisible as the hit messages and so forth do not drop - just the number that it is actually attempting to inflict damage wise.  I think multiple attack() is a fine idea, it just needed this trim in order for the mud to rebalance a bit. It is VERY important. **vital**Subj: NewsreaderCc: vital,vertebraker,fred,francesco,fakir,forbinDate: Sep 28 18:30I've written a modest news group system and a newsgroup reader that has been slipped into the /bin/play/_read command to allow players access to it.  Postings from boards all over the mud have and can be moved to the newsgroups. Vital **beck**Subj: stuffDate: Sep 29 00:15Hey, On the issues of the Rangers, I have had no response or actions taken by the other wizards, other than an inaccurate flame / hate mail from Verte. Since I rarely ever talked to him or got involved in any of his business I am not sure where it is coming from, but needless to say I never responded.

Tonight I was going to move some more files over, and found I no longer have access to the /players/guilds directory, because I have been secretly demoted down to level 90 I will not take part in this childish behavior on other wizards part, but would still like to get the Rangers moved over.  I really wish to have no involvment with the other wizards that are part of this, because of their childish behavior and motives. For instance Vital did not move those files to his directory simply for FTP access.  He went WAY out of his way to move over files that were definitely not needed in his own directory. I care not to dwell on that however, and would wish to repair the guild, and fully test it.  I will not be doing anything that affects current players, until my testing is 100% complete. I don't know the best solution, but I guess giving me access to that directory would be the simplest.  I really don't have time or energy to get into some stupid political brawl with the other senior wizards. Thanks for your time. Beck **vital** Re:   rangersCc: vertebraker,vitalDate: Sep 29 12:22laf, no. I have started moving them to guilds. The files that are there ones that have been put there by me. Beck was demoted because he's never here, serves no useful purpose and only causes people to get upset when he logs on. He has repeatedly said that he is more interested in playing "high tech" and "graphically intensive" games rather than Nirvana. If he wants to come back, log in more regularly and help the other developers, that's great.  In the meantime I've been working hard on the Rangers to keep them uptodate and semi-competitive [though less so that most other guilds as Beck's original intent was for it to an RP- focused guild.   Beck's situation is hardly unique or special and not worth the effort to fuss about. It has happened in the natural course of the life of the game that seniors have come and gone, Mythos, Mizan, Eurale, Snow, Pain... the list goes on. The game however moves on in a stateful life of its own.   "If we want to all go running around chasing butterflies with the end part of an ants' nest, fine, but let's call it that and not an expodi-whatever-it-was-Pooh said." --a.a. milne **vertebraker**Subj: wizing standardsDate: Sep 30 06:49  Ok, we all know that the quest system here SUCKS. Too many bogus quests that are practically unbeatable. It practically FORCES people to use a cheat sheet- that's why we don't crack down on it anymore. There are SOME good quests. Such as the ones coded by Eurale, Zeus, Francesco, etc. But all of these added up do not come close to the number of quests required to wiz.  I suggest we work on questing as a top priority - redesigning the system and such or the mechanism to wiz.  In the meantime, I advise that we do this:  Take applications from long-standing players .. i.e. 5+ years ? for an example. We next throw the name around - to all Senior Wizards .. Francesco, Vital, Fakir, Fred are the current active ones [besides me] .. if ANYONE disagrees .. we do not allow them to wiz in this way.  Then they still have to get a sponsor who will take care of them.  What do you think ? If you want final approval over who is wizzed, that is fine too. I just think that the system SUCKS for now, and there are some players who would like to wiz but why should we force them to go through the hoops of using a cheat sheet when we are "saying" not to in the first place ..  PLUS .. most of the quests have to be rewritten as the answers are too commonplace these days. It's just one big crap sandwich. **vertebraker** Re:   wizing standardsDate: Oct  1 05:21Ok. 5 year + old players in good standing. Approved by all active seniors. And you want final veto. Anything else we can add for now?  Remember, this is a TEMPORARY system --  can help us get some personnel from the  people floating around who have always supported  the mud.  And continue to build community, etc.,  the best part about it is the consistent policy ..  I'm not going to solicit apps from players unless I hear from you. And I'm going to talk to the other Seniors to make it clear that we don't accept wizards as sponsorees if we can't take care of them.

The concept of setting up some 'classes' or sessions for 'wax, myself and others to present topical information to interested wizards and record the series to use as later training as well. Somewhat akin to the old Descarte@TMI files, we could cover various topics that we consider 'essential' and later ones that are more esoteric but useful for those developers that don't have the benefit of our ability to crash the mud in a quick and efficient fashion.  To that end, please think for a few seconds about what kinds of topics you would like to see covered and pop me a mail back about them. 'wax and I will try to collate some kind of list and come up with a schedule for the classes and what we can cover.

And some people will just take the equipment, store it, and then checkout of the room so they can get the equipment. What I have done was I told Francesco and I called him into the room, told him what happened, answered a few of his questions, then I checked out of that room and in about another 1 minute, I will try to check into the casa de nirvanas again to see if I can get my old room back.

If your talking about the jinro monster I think the fact he killed me a bunch of times proves its not a bug.  I saw  that you changed mythos monsters so people can not leave said rooms or what not. As far as anything else, I have just logged on to idle mostly.  And maybe look at gossip or something a bit.  As far as being a wiz, I had finished the expansion on my area and was just going to ftp it and have wax approve it or tell me what needed to be changed, balanced and I cant Ftp so I was  just going to drop it.  There are things I did as a wiz character I  shouldn't have.  I admit that and I did not get pissed about it when I had levels removed from me.  I far from abuse any bugs as a player actually as far as bugs go as a player I really don't know any, I know how to kill stuff using judo against a mob, using their own strength against them or using abilities that I can get from the game to the fullest advantage, in no way  do I find crazy bugs and abuse them.

Also, it would have been impossible for the dragon to have entered the room if the room was locked. What likely occurred was you did not have the room locked, since either scenario [of him firecrackering you or the dragon entering the room] is physically impossible via the physics of the mud. Again, unless you have some sort of proof/evidence of what occurred, we can't award you anything.  And please keep such mails away from Boltar as we have informed many players in the past.

I logged on looking to revisit and get reacquainted to my first mud, and Worm sends me a tell.  He mentioned I should send a mail to you and Vertebraker mentioning that I would like to code again, said you guys were looking for experienced coders for a revamp of the mud.  Not sure how much or what type of experience you're looking for, but if its Nirvana experience, I have that. If it's coding experience, I have that (upto and including lib development on TubMud) The rub is, that I was once a wizard here and was demoted to playhood.  If I recall (It was so very long ago) it was because of something I said or did to Persephone, who was Sandman's mudmate at the time, and he must've been pissy that day or something.  Knowing who I was at the time, I probably spout off and acted childish and defensive (if not offensive).  I can assure you that kid is long gone.  I'm now 31 yrs old, happily married with 2 kids and a steady job as a network administrator for a national company.  (read:  I can login from work cause i control the firewall...)  Anyway, this is getting rather long winded.  If you're looking for another coder, I'd like to present my interest in getting re-instated and/or set at whatever level you think could help out the mud.  Earwax said he was going to send the Admin's a mail about it, but I thought I'd follow up with this.  Talk to ya later.  Rumplemintz  p.s.

He had told me that when the changes were implemented that I could trade my Neckguard, which was under 'chest' slot at that time, for the piece that put in place as the new 'chest' Elemental piece. I know Earwax has not been here for some time now, but I'd like to know if that would still stand, because I'd bought up the neckguard for that reason a good while back, because I wasn't fond of the other chest armors available these days.

Instead, they can provide special  abilities, protection values outside of ac, damage specials, etc -armor to be classified by its weight/ac ratio with the following categories:  Body Armor:    Categorization           AC  Weight    clothing/nonprotective -  0    1    light                  -  1    2    medium                 - 2-3  2-6    heavy                  - 4-6  4-8   Shields:    nonprotective          -  NA   NA    light                  -   1   1    medium                 -  2-3  2-3    heavy                  -  3-4  3-6   Head/Arms/Hands/Legs/Boots:    nonprotective          -   0   1    light                  -   1   1    medium                 -  1-2  2    heavy                  -  2-3 2-3 **earwax**Subj: Worn gear proposal part 2Cc: vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,fakir,forbin,stardream,pavlikDate: Mar 29 02:28 -Max ac items will not carry specials except in extreme circumstances, which  should fit the following criteria: rarity (no more than 1/3 chance of being  cloned), extremely dangerous mob, probably in a PK area, and being limited in  some manner as to levels or who can wear it. -Legacy gear will be automatically adjusted, due to absence of a flag to be  set in future armors, to appropriate weight based on the ac, type, and if it  has a special or not. -Armor will set a restriction level in living.c, which guilds can query, so   they can set appropriate penalties for using heavier gear than they allow. -The range of carry capacity will be adjusted - lower chars having far more  capacity than they currently have.  Strength will account for much, but a   total noob (level 1, str 10) will be able to carry reasonable gear. -The accessory items will have 0 ac in ALL cases.  Specific adjustments can be  made for special items like the e-gear, etc.  In those cases, it will be   magical protection, meaning based on specials and dtype (physical allowed)  protections.  AC will mean armor class though, and nothing that isn't armor  will have Ac. -We should implement better item statting.  I'm 100% in favor of allowing   players to have full stats (minus special information) on gear.  See below. -Randomization to some extent of gear stats.  In other words, something that  grants 10% magical protection should actually grant 5% +- random(5).  This  will make the best stuff more unique, and in combination with allowing the  players full statistical knowledge, will help us create an actual economy. -An auction system.  Taking advantage of the above steps, combined with the  forced diversity that this system will foster - between guild reqs, armor  restriction/encumbrance levels/randomness/knowledge - will foster major   progress in moving toward a cap-less and full economy. -Gear-induced stat modifiers.  This will go more hand-in-hand with possible  future races and stat changes.  Not as important right now, but it should be  kept in mind. -Narrower range of item values.  Shit worth 200k is foolish. **pavlik**Subj: statsCc: (To: earwax) pavlik,boltar,fred,vertebrakerDate: Mar 29 10:31>We should implement better item statting.

Anyways as players gain a level they gain perhaps 5 attrib points to distribute as they wish, perhaps a random stat will raise automatically each level.  Max for each stat will be 30, to conform with current standards; each race however, will have different maxes for each stat, with 30 being the ceiling.  Stats will be more in control of a char's power than level, but they gain stats through levels and xlevels.  Currently I don't have anything planned for gaining stats in any way other than level, although that may change.  strength:     damage bonuses in combat, carry capacity dexterity:    chance to hit in combat, dodge, parry, skills etc constitution: hp, hpr (regen rate), endurance points, epr willpower:    innate resistances, willpower type checks, has an effect on ep mental:       sp/spr, int/wis checks  racial, static stats: they either don't change, or aren't controlled by char: luck:      they can 'roll' this stat at char generation charisma:  also roll this at char generation, within limits set by race size:      this will go up as they level, until they reach their max size            also a rolled stat  Specifics:  HP: 10* con + 2*level + 2*xlevel      7  con at level 1  means 72  max hp - higher than now     30 con at level 19 means 338 max hp - about equivalent to now  SP: 10* men + 3*level + 3*xlevel      7  men at level 1  = 73      30 men at level 19 = 357   EP: 7*con + 3*wil + 2*level + 2*xlevel  HPR: racial modifier + con hp regen per minute, max of 60 SPR: racial modifier + men sp regen per minute EPR: racial modifier + 2/3 con + 1/3 wil  current stat checks will be routed to the most appropriate stat  Implementation: these won't go fully into the game for general players until this stuff has been thoroughly tested and races, gear changes, skills are ready to go in as well, but they will be the first in for testing. **earwax**Subj: attribsCc: vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 20 08:05I was planning on taking the variables and funs out of player.c that are used for attribs, having it inherit the file - to make it easier to work on ...

It's not a big deal, most of us have figured out what that is and really don't have issues with it, maybe an occassional bug, but I think this is stuff that could probably be dealt with in a  better way.  What I'm wondering is the feasibility of having the  commands players type checked vs their nicknames/aliases on the driver side, so we don't have to worry about what's in the top of the  inventory or anything else.    -ew **earwax**Subj: the alias/nickname thingDate: Jun  9 13:23I found what I was looking for, it'll require parsing for the aliases and nicknames in master.c though, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem, since all it'd be doing boils down to parsing strings **earwax**Subj: wax on other ipDate: Jun 12 02:24can you add him to the player.c ip checks, he can't logon right now  heh sorry :( **earwax**Subj: dev mudDate: Jun 12 14:06i hosed master.c with it, can you yank the code i had or just replace master.c over there....i think i had like 6 lines of code all the way at the bottom, so whatever's easiest thanks -ew . **muerte**Subj: Casa room 273Cc: zeotideDate: Jun 21 13:48Just curious as what I can do about this problem.

The instances will be logged to /log/OBJECT_VIOLATIONS Take those entries with a grain of salt, it's very easy to eventually end up (within a reboot) with gear from an alt char, at times, but this is a tool for tracking repeat violations and extreme ones. It replaces mizan's object tracking, which was extremely resource- heavy, and very limited, through no fault of his, merely the lack of opportunity to implement it on the lib-level.  -Earwax **highlander**Subj: mudkidsDate: Jul 11 01:35ok here goes i had 3 kids pabloette tinker bella they were all around level 5-10 and i left sometime around july 2004 i believe  pabloette i don't remember the mother but i believe the other 2 were from nolee or nolle whichever is the one i am married too 88 **highlander**Subj: kids contDate: Jul 11 01:38first parent on tinker and bella should be nolee if i remember correctly pabloette was store in the sec room the other 2 should be in room 3 or 1 i think that is about all i can remember if it is too much trouble don't worry about it unless you are just bored lol thank you in advance if you choose to return them to me **earwax**Subj: read/write access settings for wizardsCc: verteDate: Jul 28 14:11I've talked with verte on this before, but what I'm going to do is have it so a wizard trying to check out another wizard's stuffs will go through an access.c file, which the individual wizards can setup to allow or disallow access to their dirs by other wizards (under level 100 of course)...  For example, say I want to allow Ew access to all the files in my directory, except for the closed ones, I'd have an access.c that looks like this:  status allow_read(string path, string name) {   if (!path || !name) return 0;   if (name == "ew" && strstr(path, "closed") > 0) return 1;   return 0; }  There's other ways you'd check for other types of access of course, but that's it in a nutshell.

The part of it I'm dealing with right now is the situations where a player types something, or logs on and it tries to save somehow (ie, locker code will do this, your hotel possibly, my housing code for sure) and the hypothetical situations where a lib object forces write access checks...the read access will be much trickier on this, but still shouldn't be a problem - btw, looks like open is an automatic from the driver-end, at least i'm not seeing  write-checks for open dirs when i experiment there...  sorry this got so long, i'm a little hyper i guess heh :)  **earwax**Subj: valid read and writeDate: Aug  4 17:04Ok, looks like they are pretty much flawless for bin'd commands. I have it so ed will be read-only if it's a file they don't have access to, and write-access if they do have it (this takes password into consideration as well of course) and that seems to be working flawlessly as well.  the player access.c thing - to allow access  to a wizard's dir to another wiz works perfectly thus far as well, although I'll probably have to test that out thoroughly one day. I've tested most of the stuff pretty heavily - I still have to finish the miscellaneous approvals/denials for file access, and a lot of my testing has been to find those spots that I need to build checks for, as well as studying the shit out of this port's valid-read and write code...  In any case I'm not as far along as I would have liked to be, but a lot of this has been testing and studying and figuring out as many of the special cases as possible, so hopefully in next couple days it'll be ready for other wizards to contribute.  Although before  that happens, I'll have to put some kind of system in place for  communication (prolly a board and have your save-object patch ignore the board file so it can save), and draw up a primer for basic  differences, things to look for, and the simpler things that you  can't do on the new port that you could get away with on the other.  Anyways, sorry to be sending these long mails, but on a project like this it feels like i should be sending out progress reports hehe :)  oh, and fred and i have been working on the souls, switching out as much as possible to the bin, that's a little slower of a project  than i'd like but it has to be slow in a way, plus fred's doing a  ton of the more tedious stuff with it :)  Hopefully I can put forbin to recoding the mud-chat system (not channel, talking about the  mythos chat boxes in player soul) for the new mud, in a better way, or i'd guess fred'll handle it if not  ew **earwax**Subj: the stat bugDate: Aug  4 17:12the thing that happened with teiannia also happened with hedren, and in both cases they were coming off being inactive...so my guess would be that's where the problem is....hopefully it's nothing i  did, but anything is possible heh....just heads-up on it  ew **earwax**Subj: Code standards docsCc: vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Aug  8 03:58I've put them in /doc/build/code_standards and /doc/build/headers Please take a look at them and let me know if there's anything else I need to address, or anything I should change.

Anyways lemme know what  you think, but I have a shitton of things to do to the player object coming within the next week or so.  Also: unrelated, but I'd like to start bringing some wizards over  and having them work on things, at the least, starting to fix and test areas, I'll have to try to hack the security still, but it seems pretty solid, but lemme know what you think.  -ew **earwax**Subj: player.cDate: Aug 17 04:42Made some changes to player.c in a buncha places.

In fact, I would say he uses snoop more than all other 60+ wizards combined, he ONLY logs on to use it, then he uses it a lot.  Not to mention the fact he hasn't done anything on a code or administrative end in years, not to mention he primarily sits on channels as playerchars and bitches.  (I've heard complaints on this from probably the majority of current active players). I really think this needs looking into, especially considering that  the majority of the wizards point to him, stardream, certain others and say well, it doesn't matter about levels, look at them, they don't do anything constructive, they don't know what they are doing, what does it matter what I do.  I'm just trying to wash my hands of this, but it's all a very frustrating issue.  I can go far more in depth on some of these if you really  desire, but I'm just trying to wash my hands of it all, like I said.  Anyways, I'm strongly considering just simply disabling snoop to see who bitches about it...In 3 years, I can almost guarantee fakir has used it more than me, yet it's never for debugging, which is what over 99% of my own snoops have been for... this isn't sour grapes,  it's a consistent complaint and something I've noticed BIG TIME ... right now the bugs aren't in for it, but I had logging in the wizsoul that triggered on every use of snoop, and fakir blew every other wizard away for entries on it, I mean, for all the other shit I was logging, combined, for all wizards, it was all fakir snoops.  Which boggles me for how rarely he is on...  I'm not the one to bring this up, considering our past, but junior wizards have a lot of resentment toward him and certain others, and I would just like you to spend some effort to watch his actual efforts.  Blah, whatever... heh, I got other shit to deal with but i promised that I'd bring this up to you... heh  -ew **rick**Subj: mudconnectDate: Sep 20 23:41You might want to update the mudconnect web page to something more well...up to date.

If you wish to know what I am talking about, read some of the mails he has sent me.  Personally, I like the mud the way it is. I don't want to change it. I have no intention of dancing to some tune Earwax feels like playing on his flute. I do not, nor never have abused wizard powers. I occasionally snoop a player, but never when two players are in a room or chatting. And, I usually (almost always) tell a player if and when I am snooping them and also when I turn snoop off.  Its absurd that Earwax even brings that into a conversation about being a wizard.   Personally Boltar, I am sick and tired of his heavy handed way of dealing with things...and it's my opinion you are going to have a dead mud very soon because of it.  I will not tolerate someone who threatens, cajoles, and is otherwise a dick.   It is true I do not contribute to the mud much, other than the areas I did code and are in play.  However, I have never seen my contribution here to be one of code.  Wizards come and go...power hungry, unstable wizards have come and gone.  In almost every case where there has been an abuse of power, or a lack of good judgement, I have had a hand in resolving that issue...in some way or another.  And, I might add, you have usually backed me up in most of the disputes I have had some involvement in.  I don't really care what Earwax does. I do not have the juice, nor the time, nor really the interest anymore to try and corral his over-bloated ego...I suspect that issue, if its dealt with, will have to rest with you. apply sphere to being a wizard here...I've had a good run. I have enjoyed the game, and enjoyed for the most part the people I have met here.  If the current gestapo Earwax does indeed have his way and dewizes me, so be it.  Even though he feels otherwise, I still think I contribute something to the game...but as always, I will leave that up to you to decide. I am way too old and way to long in the tooth here to care much what some bully wizard dictates to me as being 'his way or the highway'.  Do you really want someone like this in charge of things to the point you give him THAT much authority?  Vert NEVER had an ego like Earwax. He NEVER abused any wizard power. He never, once he became a wizard, cheated the game. I cannot say the same for Earwax.  There is a WORLD of difference between Vertebraker and Earwax as far as Admin goes.  Personally, if Earwax is in charge, I don't want to be a wizard here. * **fakir**Subj: dewizzingCc: (To: earwax) boltar,vertebraker,fred,illarion,francesco,forbin,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Oct  7 19:33You do what you wish...or rather...whatever B lets you get away with.  Personally, I'd bump you back to a level more fitting of your mental capacity and temperament, but unfortunately, we don't have wizards in the negative level category.  If you continue to travel the path you are currently walking, you will have a very dead mud.  I can almost guarantee it.  Further, I don't give a SHIT what you think, want, or do.  I lost all respect for you as a wizard when I caught you cheating with triggers.  You should have been de-wizzed then, and you should not be a wizard in charge of diddly shit now.  You have neither the skill nor ability to manage people...your ego is far to large a barrier for you to even see over, let alone allow you to manage others in a civil and appropriate manner.  Someday, when you grow up, and really learn what real life is all about, you will look back on this letter and chuckle.  I will no doubt be long gone by then, however.  Have a good life, and good luck riding herd over the bunch of twelve year old players your going to foster here...its right up your alley. f **fakir**Subj: my areasDate: Oct  7 19:43By the way, if I am dewizzed here, I'd like my areas taken out of the game. I would no longer have any controll over it, and I would not want anyone else messing around with it. I know you would respect my wishes...and I am firm on this.  (and please do not look upon this as some kind of threat...its not...I just don't want my code in the game if I am not here playing. Its just that simple....honestly.) Kind of odd...I am sitting here thinking how much I used to like playing here. I miss the old guys...Eurale, Vert, Snow, Arrina, Dream, Feld, Wocket...all the good guys who used to make it fun to be here. I even miss Mal....though he had the same issue's Earwax currently has...an over inflated ego.  I think earwax is even worse than Mal...but I am just too tired to deal with something like this all over again.  I do think you need to take a good, long, hard look at what is going on in the Castle of Earwax, however.  As far as I know, its YOUR mud...not HIS.

Whatever I'm allowed to get away with.  Personally I'd rather not make decisions, I'd rather just code, that's what I'm good at and what I enjoy.  Babysitting a bunch of grown adults does nothing but irritate me and make me less productive.  I like to figure out  problems and code solutions to them.  This is my enjoyment, and it's the surrogate challenge for me, since the game is simply too easy as a player.  Now, the shit with the triggers, you yourself said and know that it wasn't like it was beneficial to me.  I was dealing with  exhaustion pure and simple.  But that's beside the point, I did what I did, but it still pales in comparison to your own abuses.  I made a mistake, you made repeated mistakes, and more than that, you haven't done anything positive for the game in years, and you have worked hard to be negative.  You bitch, but offer no solutions nor put forth any work.  The work I've done in one single object alone is more than your sum total of code in this game, ever, not to mention the simple fact that it's years beyond your comprehension or POTENTIAL level of  improvement.    If we want to get into specifics, I've done my best, other wizards have as well, to get you involved with improvements in the game.  Instead,  you're content with a slow death over the years, a slow reduction in playerbase each year, until this mud dies, whereas I'm doing everything I can to get as much influence from players and wizards to come up with solutions.  Not only that but I'm putting out thousands of lines of code, working with every wizard I can to teach them and tutor them, improve their skills, and encourage them, whereas you're most happy when you can sit on star and just talk shit about people as a playerchar.  I'm responding here, in this way, because you forced this.  The bottom line is that you spend your time on as a wizard griping and using the snoop command.  I spend mine coding and teaching others and encouraging others and administrating.  This is not even an implication, it's  simple fact.  The logs, the inherits and bug logs and everything else and every wizard on here, pretty much, speak for this, without me having to, yet you want to have a pissing contest.  How about this, put up, shut up, and have a positive impact other than resting on a single, minor area, you did however many years ago, with no positive impact since, instead of trying to put down my efforts.  Ego?  You're real funny, since you aren't even a competant builder, talking about someone that is a highly competant coder, that is doing their best to incorporate the ideas of everyone playing and coding for the game, especially where you just gripe and offer no solutions or work.  When you actually make a contribution open your mouth.  But that isn't going to happen, so just shut the fuck up.  -Earwax/David Halek **fakir**Subj: bullshitCc: (To: earwax) boltar,fakir,xDate: Oct  8 10:52If my being a wizard here is somehow hindering your efforts to take over the mud, then by all means de-wiz me!  I know how difficult it can be to have your own way with these kids you insta-wiz (like chip) if someone else is around watching what you do, both as a wizard and as a player.  There were three (3) other wizards logged in who were well aware of your trigger cheat...but not one of them even paid attention nor had the  balls to call you on it.  Well, gosh, I wonder why. apply sphere to your ego, all one needs do is read the venom and self angrandization (not a real word, I know, but it describes what I see)alias to get a feel for what a king size ego you really have.  I am in awe of your greatness! As to what YOU do, as I said before, I don't give a SHIT. It  is what B does that will interest me.  If he allows you to  have complete and udder control of this mud, then so be it. If that is the case, I don't want to be a wizard here. I can  tolerate you being a wizard...but I could not tolerate you  being a wizard that has any fucking thing to do with me or what I do here.  In my opinion, you are sadly lacking in any kind of people skills, your ego IS far larger than any I  have encountered here, and your heavy handed, bullying style of management is going to drive ppl away from the mud rather than bring them in...regardless of what you do as a coder. Personally, I think the reason you want me gone is so you CAN do more as you wish, rather than as you should.  I'm about  the only one here who would actually call you on something. Bottom line, Earwax, is that you can rant and rave all you  want...its still Boltar who calls the shots here.  I'll  abide by whatever HE decides, not you.  And by the way, my  usage of the term 'udder' was not incorrect.

Most of the people I really enjoyed talking to and playing with are long gone. Honestly, I think the time for me to take leave has come as well. I've been thinking about this all morning.  Its kind of like getting a divorce...hard to do.  I've put all my chars into inactive status except Sticks. He was my first char here, and  I do still have a few ppl I talk to or mail, so I will leave him active to log in with occasionaly...though it may prove better to just leave and not have much to do with the 'new' Nirvana.  I like the old one.  I also was never under the impression you had deligated the power to ANY wizard to just promote, demote, or do as they wish with the mud.  Earwax seems to think he has the power and ability to just do as he sees fit. If you gave him that power, then fine.  Other- wise, he has a very large problem of over stepping his bounds. As to what happens to this char (Fakir) I really don't care much anymore.  I have been working on some areas, but as you  know, I have a fairly responsible job in real life. I don't  have tons of time to spend here other than when I want to  unwind a bit.  I do know that I will not tolerate someone like Earwax acting the dictator.  I'd rather just leave.

Odd coincidence ALL his player chars are in prison. I find it odd that ALL of one players chars can do something so terrible in this day and age of the game to warrant prison. Be careful Earwax does not lose the last few remaining players you have here.

Otherwise...you can do as you wish...its your mud. **vertebraker**Subj: backupsDate: Nov 20 20:37I need backups of  /players/vertebraker/guilds/vampires/bin/  restored from yesterday or the day before. Thanks. **vertebraker** Re:   backupsDate: Nov 22 07:46okay, the backup of the 13th then. **mizan**Subj: cleipaCc: (To: fred) boltar,earwaxDate: Nov 25 21:53I guess if you get the chance, please free cleipa at your convenience. If the character is freed already, most likely boltar or earwax or anyone >L1000 has done it... It isn't Cleipa's first offense but being locked up since august sort of makes up for it :)  thanks, -tij **chip**Subj: Leave Of AbsenceCc: earwax,vertebraker,fred,star,veeshan,mizan,vital,angel,wipeout,forbin,lacar,mokri,mosobp,jareel,jaraxle,stardream,rumplemintz,sparrowDate: Nov 29 17:42I just want to let you all know I'm not going to be able to be around for quite some time. I may be able to pop in from time to time but will be few and far between, and for the few times I might be able to show, I will have a maximum of just a few minutes. So I'm saying my temporary goodbyes to you all and want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to become a part of the wonderful crew of developers we have here. Rest assured this is not a permanent leave by any means, but it will be for quite a while. I'm going to miss all you guys, and if I forget anyone in the CCs that you can think of, if you could let them know for me I'd be very grateful. Hope to see you all again sometime soon. Yours.

Thanks!  Angel **mokri**Subj: Bugs and thingsDate: Jan  3 17:45Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I figured out a person can get around the IP masking security by simply reading /log/ENTER.  That is, low level wizards (myself included) are not supposed to be able to see IP addresses; but, we CAN read that file all we want, and the IP's are there for all to see.  Thought you might want to know.  blah. **baskin**Subj: grieferCc: **Date: Jan 22 02:15Ok dude. One less player you have here. This time...I am gone. I am sure your just thrilled.  I am sick and tired or your attitude...as if having a mud is some turn on.  You put your chips with earwax. See where it gets you. Nobody plays...nobody cares anymore.  Its gone downhill for the last year and continues to do so.  When I leave...one less player...so be it.  You just keep spending the 25 bucks a month to keep it up.  I have put money, time, and effort into this game...you just see grief.  Ok.  I never thought much of your admin anyhow. You just want someone to run this place for you. q x **rumplemintz**Subj: level_listCc: vertebrakerDate: Feb  7 01:01For some reason my test is showing up on the top level list It is marked as a test character, so I'm not sure why it's showing up. But without being able to see the code, I'm not going to guess.  Just an FYI **rumplemintz** Re:   level_listDate: Feb  7 09:51>>because the top player list is script run outside the mud. reduce it's >>exp.  Roger that.  Thx **blade**Subj: this charDate: Feb  9 04:53need to be restored when you get that chance please. thanks big man. blade **knytemayre**Subj: Old schoolers!!!Cc: ~sDate: Feb 14 07:35Greetings, Boltar! Long time, no see, huh?  It's been -10- years since I was last on here. Damn, this place has changed.  How's everything goin? I don't suppose my old character files are still around somewhere, are they?  Login "knytemayre"  Password "schmuck" If they are, and you could reinstate them, I'd love you forever.  You'd be my hero and stuff.  If not, I guess I'll live. . .but oh well.  So anyway, drop me a line when you get a sec.  I chatted with Star for a few earlier. . .she was catching me up on old gossip. :) Later! Knytemayre **knytemayre**Subj: shop bugDate: Feb 15 04:14Hello again, Boltar. I've got a bug for ya, now.  I am unable to sell anything at any shop. It's probably got something to do with the file restore you did for me. I can use other shop functions, but no selling.  All I get is a "What?" . . .feels like I'm talking to a mentally-challenged Stone Cold Steve Austin fan. *shiver* Any help would be appreciated. :) Knytemayre **"
