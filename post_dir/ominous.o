It adds to the array at the end copying the name of the object: /players/dragnar/WalkingDead/mons/walker_pet/walker_pet Then it replaces the first one with save. Useful stuff, just trying to share knowledge, if I get to be a pain tell me to shut up. . Note: object_name returns the path of the object, however if it is currently loaded into memory it will have a # at the end plus a unique number for the object number. basename removes that, if it is there. --Gnar **"
