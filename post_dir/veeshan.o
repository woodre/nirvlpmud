There will be plenty of time for questions of course. :^)  In addition to these classes, I am working on freeing up my schedule to work with those of you who would like to learn how to code or code better more individually.  I will try to mix in Nirvana-related examples in addition to the textbooks. Here is the link to the textbooks in case you wish to start reading ahead of time. :^)  http://www.mars.org/home/rob/docs/descartes-index.html **vertebraker**Subj: LPC classDate: Oct 12 20:07Are you interested in the LPC class this Saturday @ 2p ? **earwax**Subj: some shit i threw at verte regarding attribsCc: (To: subotai) vertebarker,linus,veeshanDate: Oct 13 05:43Before guilds/skills or races can be messed with outside of theory, attribs have to be changed.  They need to be made meaningful in a better game sense.  Here's what I've run by verte so far, gonna send you more later,  but i wanna get some further ideas going so we can get moving on shit.  You tell Vertebraker: ok, the system that i always liked as a player was simply having racial maxes differ, with some races having better overall stats, some having special abilities....humans generally getting either an exp bonus (cuz they are more diverse, quick to adapt) or being better suited for doing any guild/multiclassing....trolls have regen, shit like that. ->> tell verte now instead of exp raising them directly, they gain with levels, you can go see stat trainers and spend cash/quest/exp/maydifferbetweentrainers to raise your stats above what levels get you You tell Vertebraker: now instead of exp raising them directly, they gain with levels, you can go see stat trainers and spend cash/quest/exp/maydifferbetweentrainers to raise your stats above what levels get you. ->> tell verte PERHAPS some type of reincarnation/remort or some other system (quests, donation points, whatever) where stats can be raised above your racial max, plus some sort of customization when you create your character You tell Vertebraker: PERHAPS some type of reincarnation/remort or some other system (quests, donation points, whatever) where stats can be raised above your racial max, plus some sort of customization when you create your character. ->> tell verte items of course can change stats, potions, whatever you want You tell Vertebraker: items of course can change stats, potions, whatever you want. ->> tell verte i'm not saying that's the be-all, end-all of methods, it just happens to be the one i prefer as a player, i really don't like the exp for stats thing in advance, it's cheap and annoying, and not very thematic either You tell Vertebraker: i'm not saying that's the be-all, end-all of methods, it just happens to be the one i prefer as a player, i really don't like the exp for stats thing in advance, it's cheap and annoying, and not very thematic either. **vertebraker**Subj: maledictaCc: (To: angel) beck,catt,earwax,eurale,fakir,feldegast,forbin,francesco,fred,gemini,illarion,jamila,jara,jaraxle,jenny,khrell,lacar,linus,lishe,martha,mokri,mosobp,pain,pavlik,pestilence,sampson,skie,sparkle,star,stardream,subotai,tristian,veeshan,vital,wocket,wren,zeusDate: Oct 31 15:44   Maledicta [the wizard] wishes to return to Nirvana.   Please mail a vote [yes/no] and your comment to Vertebraker **earwax**Subj: Armor shitCc: (To: zeus) wocket,feldegast,pain,jaraxle,eurale,beck,jenny,pestilence,puppy,wren,martha,gemini,angel,jamila,catt,star,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,mokri,sparrow,rumplemintz,aquila,lacar,quicksilver,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,catacomb,hair,veeshan,haywire,skie,sampson,y,chax,lisheDate: Mar 29 02:39I'd like you all to give me some feedback on this shit, just send me a reply to it....basically it involves a HUGE fundamental change to the mud, but one long overdue, i (and many players and wizzes) feel.  Basically, instead of all guilds, all players, using same gear  essentially, and everything being max ac, weight 1, with specials,  this will create a lot of diversity, especially considering that the guilds can be made to utilize the changes very easily.  The file to look at is /open/earwax/armor.txt  Just send a reply, not reply all, or post, I'll be sharing all feedback with the other admins and whatnot.  This is a major deal, so please send your feedback.  -earwax **boltar** Re:   char purgesDate: Jul 13 16:24all restoredsd **earwax**Subj: ldmudCc: (To: forbin) francesco,fakir,pavlik,stardream,jenny,pain,zeus,wocket,feldegast,vital,jaraxle,eurale,khrell,pestilence,puppy,star,wren,angel,martha,gemini,jamila,catt,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,aquila,kain,lacar,brittany,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,airwoman,catacomb,veeshan,haji,hair,skie,chip,sampson,chax,y,atipode,lisheDate: Oct  6 07:22I need to see work on this project.  I've been asking for it for months, but I haven't seen anything.  Yesterday, I recommended automatic dewizzing of all wizards not involved, so I'm trying to prevent this because it WILL happen otherwise.  In other words, I'm trying to see work done, so this doesn't happen, although if it doesn't I'm the  one to blame and the first to take the blame, because I fully intend to dewiz every single individual that does not get involved.  I have the position, I have the power, and i'm using it, is the bottom line.  If you want to keep your wizard get involved with this.  It's seriously the most important project in the last 15 years.  -david (dhalek@comcast.net) **chip** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 04:07really? you don't snoop players chatting? then it's so funny how you knew the things my templar said to Earwax about a matter dealing with your templar who was on at the time, you drunk egotistical worthless fucking jackass. I think wax's ideas are going to be a huge improvement for the mud and will bring a much larger Pbase. only people who may find him a dick are the abusers/grievers/cheaters. so which category shall you place yourself in? take a pick, heh. no one needs to hear your whining when you're never even around to give any of it solid structure. find something better to do than bitch about things you're not even getting yourself involved in. if you don't like how things are, don't bitch. change em. which means come here more regularly. i've not found thing one wrong with the projects Earwax has proposed and begun. and i'm quite sure in my own mind, being a long time player myself, that this mud needs an admin like Earwax to weed out the weak and the whining. and if you're so heartbroken that the  mud will be doing so well here in the very near future just because you won't be involved to get recognition for it, then maybe you should be dewizzed. i personally will not be expecting recognition, for i'm not able to be involved due to heavy hitting life circumstances. tho, I'm not bitching either, because the place i have called home for over 10 years will continue to be home and a nice one at that. i just wish we could get more wizzes like Wax, Verte, Bolts and Fred around here. and as soon as humanly possible, i'm hoping to learn tons from all 4, Wax especially. Chip - Apprentice Developer (learning) **boltar** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: chip) zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 13:37  All,   If you have something to say, say it to me.

I may be able to pop in from time to time but will be few and far between, and for the few times I might be able to show, I will have a maximum of just a few minutes. So I'm saying my temporary goodbyes to you all and want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to become a part of the wonderful crew of developers we have here. Rest assured this is not a permanent leave by any means, but it will be for quite a while. I'm going to miss all you guys, and if I forget anyone in the CCs that you can think of, if you could let them know for me I'd be very grateful. Hope to see you all again sometime soon. Yours.

The problem is that these guys might be swapping them on occasion, or harmlessly just playing from each other's houses and such. But in any event thanks for theheads-up I tend to let the little swaps slide, but jump on anything that involves a large piece of EQ or that sort of thing...  -tij ? **boltar**Subj: desting crittersCc: earwax,mizanDate: Jul 24 19:47  W T F?   Don't cheat for your player chacters.
