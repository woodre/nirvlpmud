Decide on the number of Warlords, Laws.. everything.  I know its a lot to ask, but I couldnt find someone more suitable to  do it fairly, not based on any friendship or grudge.  Think you can swing with that?   We'll deal with anyone who gets pissed..   I know you said you didnt really want the spot, but now its yours and  I think atm you're the best for it. I hope you feel up to the job.  If you're serious about the role, i'll push for you getting execute and  unguild. I'll try my best not to step in anytime soon. I wanna see how  it all works out.  If you dont feel up to it, let me know.  For Shardak,  -worm **morpheus**Subj: lawDate: Jun  7 22:18worm said to talk to you about getting law before you gave it to amiro so im talkin to ya ;) snicker just do whatever dont matter to me ;) im just here for the raping pillaging and murder morph **worm**Subj: HehCc: (To: doodle) spyderDate: Jul 15 02:07I'm back. **"
