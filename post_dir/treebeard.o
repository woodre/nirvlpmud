That will give you a complete set of every card printed from Alpha through the most recent set [Future Sight]  Tenth Edition [Xe] will be out in a week or so, but will take a little while longer to get put into WebWizard. But I can't complain about the price [free] as opposed to actually buying cards [pain].  As for time, mornings/afternoons your time are generally when I'm around. I'm not always logged in [kename] but if you email me I'll pop on fairly quickly.  *grin*  email has become a bit of a lifestyle for me. heh.  Later, K **"
