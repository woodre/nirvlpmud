Call and hopefully I can talk. I told Bill that you might need someone to talk to while you are driving on the road. So hopefully I can actually talk, just might have to be careful what is said if he's around. Anyway, they used all the minutes on the fucking prepaid, so house phone or james cell is all I have now. Miss you, be safe! Luv, me **dragnar**Subj: RangersDate: Jul 23 18:26Can you try to log into LD and check the Ranger damage? I fixed the MK Scar so hopefully you can log in ;) --Gnar **sami**Subj: dbzDate: Jul 15 23:09107.3.249.169  port 8395. check it out    i dont get home till 10pm est friday. so lemme know * **careen**Subj: directionsDate: Jul 19 05:31thanks..gives me something to do while your not around the next couple of nights.... did you copy and paste those directions? or type them that fast?...damn...told you that your good..
