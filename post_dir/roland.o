messages "sundin**Subj: Ranger Char CleanupCc: (To: vital) rolandDate: Feb 23 16:43We have recently begun to get interest in joining the Rangers again since i have been back now. I did a quick finger of players that are in the guild taking up spots that can be used and found 4 that no longer exist, and I believe 3 that have not logged on since 2002. Would it be possible to make some room for those who do still play and would like to try the best guild on the mud?   The Brandy Ranger! (Sundin)  **"
