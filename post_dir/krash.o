messages "krash**Subj: Please Help (I'm Begging!)Cc: (To: fred) krashDate: Feb  5 09:17Fred, as we talked about the other night, Krash seemed to have contracted some in-game disease from some shady lady in the Enchanted Glade and his stats continue to fall more and more each day.  I'm asking, not as a wizard, but as a fellow mudder who seems to know how to find a cure, please help.  I have combed the area, tried the concoctions offered by Madam Rue (including the shot costing 80k), and tried to barter for a potion.  I've searched the hidden areas I've found and even dragged Dragnar there to help, but found nothing.  Last night, as a last resort, Krash committed suicide (as you can see by the obituary) to finally face the inevitable death and be done with it. However, after spending all night getting his levels back and re-raising his stats, it happened again and all his core stats dropped drastically.  I'm all for exploring new areas and facing the consequences, but this has ceased to be fun.  I beg you, please give me a clue to how to cure this.  Thanks Krash **dragnar**Subj: wipeout/thomasCc: googleplexDate: Apr  7 20:50I talked to him. Lame I know, but let me know if anything changes. --Gnar googleplex **dragnar**Subj: prestigeDate: May  1 20:19Ready for you, I've tested the fix and we are good. I've taken a copy of your guild file just in case.  Just beware, part of the prestige process it now makes you quit out... --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: Prestige SkillsCc: deathseeker,titan,thomasDate: May 14 10:54I have given all of you the HP Bonus for prestige. Thank you all for the effort you have given during this beta test! --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: Mage mimage & PartiesDate: May 27 15:07Fixed the issue with mimage in the standard party obj! Can't wait to test it out :) --Gnar **"
