I have read your letter of application to our Family, and would like to speak with you.  If you still have the desire to become a child of the night, please mail me with evenings and times you will be available for the next week.  Until then, I remain Your Alexis, Bella Morte **alexis** Re:   Your applicationCc: khrellDate: Mar 31 19:37Mortal, I will look for you on Tuesday or Wednesday.  It is rare that I am here past 9pm CST, but I will linger on those evenings as I can. Regards, Alexis, Bella Morte **william**Subj: DarknessDate: Oct  1 13:28Hello, potential vampire here. I just wanted to extend greetings to the most recent vampires to have logged and ask that you consider letting me into your family. Aside from the '1' typo at the beginning of my post I feel it is a good post. Let me know if you have any questions or requests of me. **"
