I guess age and nostalgia will make one see things in a much more sentimental vein.  It was good to see you the other day, however, under different circumstances it would have been wonderful.  It hurt to see you in such a painful situation with nothing more I could do for you.  I know that words in that situation offer minor solace at best, and I honestly was at a loss to express my sorrow for you.   Several months ago, I found a journal of letters you had written to me while in college.  I re-read them and I realized how shallow and self-absorbed I must have been when we were together.  You expressed love at every turn, while it seemed I kept pulling away, happy to be myself in a relationship instead of us as a couple.  How very sad that some of the most memorable words recalled from our time together are myself either asking "what's wrong?" or saying "I'm sorry."  The memories of our conversations should be a bit more substantial.  It has been too long since we last saw each other; far too many moments have passed in our lives.  Still, I think of you most days, and have thought about you almost all of them since we split.  I have yet to meet anyone that remotely reminds me of you, of your beauty, your confidence, and your burning personality.  Don't get me wrong, life has been full of wonderful and beautiful moments, but they'd be much more striking when shared with someone that truly cares.  Listening to your voice again the other evening was marvelous, and hearing the sweet smile in your words was bliss.  To sound clichd, seeing you again caused my head to spin and made me dizzy inside.  I truly miss our friendship, our time together just being together; nothing special to do or place to go, just being in each others presence.  I cannot believe that I never told you, at least in action, how special you were and how important you were to me, how lucky I feel to this day to have known and loved and been loved by you.  Being with you was incredible easy; time spent around you was comforting.  Holding hands, a kiss on the cheek, a movie or a book or just listening to you breathe was reassuring and blissful.  I loved you, but was unprepared to love you as much as I did. It frightened me and I hurt you, pulled away, causing you to pull away in response.  It was a mistake.  Maybe I can make it up to you sometime, somehow. **"
