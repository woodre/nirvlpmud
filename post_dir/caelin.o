I cut it short or grew it long or styled it different ways or dyed it different colors.  I had control over it and it helped me define who I was.  These days I'm not as inclined to play with my hair since I like how it looks short.  However I have continued to play with my facial hair in much the same way.  From long sideburns to a full beard to a light or full goatee to a hideous mustache, clit tickler, or immense tuft of chin hair, I have changed it as I wanted to.  When I started working at Sharebuilder I had a goatee and I kept it for at least 6 months; that was the longest period of static facial hair for me since I first grew facial hair. 	To be asked by the most wonderful person to shave or have a long beard is something new for me.  People have had preferences before, but they've never compelled me one way or another. I typically made my choices completely independently of anyone else.  Right now it's hard for me to feel like I haven't lost part of my identity.  I know I'll get used to it; this is just why I fear changing others.  It's easy enough to say that little things don't matter, but I don't want you to have to remind me to shave and then eventually, years later, I get upset about it.  "It's my face I can do what I want with it!" "Fine then I won't kiss you!" "Fine!"  **zeus**Subj: this is a love letterDate: Jun  6 22:18This is a love letter ... This is a love letter ... This is a love letter ... From me to you.  I know you can't hear Spencer Moody singing that with his drunken wail at the final Murder City Devils show, but I will play it for you.  I realized today that never before in my life had I truly felt love.  Of course, I had called my feelings love in the past, but only out of ignorance.  Never did I experience such a logical sense of reckless abandon until I met you; never had I known that only one thing mattered: that I am with you.  Cart before the horse?  Perhaps you said it best when you said you're on the train.  I just hope I am too.  How clich is it to think that I finally understand what all those poets struggled to write about; what all those painters strove to convey with a brush; what millions of men have died for?  How could all of this possibly be real?  I can only hope that it is.  My biggest fear is that you might realize that you made a mistake and that I'm not quite as good as you thought I was.  Maybe you won't realize it right away, maybe it won't be for many years, but that thought scares me. We are fallible creatures, after all.  But this fear does me no good.  I can't live my life in fear.  Every day I spend with you is made better.  I may not have faith in religion, but I choose to have faith in this.  There is no reason to be cautious.  I know just as others know God is real that this is the right choice.  This is my religion.  **worm**Subj: lafDate: Jun 14 11:30 i'll spam you with lyrics when you arent even here!  Such a sexy,sexy pretty little thing Fierce nipple pierce you got me sprung with your tongue ring and I ain't gonna lie cause your loving gets me high So to keep you by my side there's nothing that I won't try Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill Time is passing I'm asking could this be real Cause I can't sleep I can't hold still The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal  I can feel too much is never enough You're always there to lift me up When these times get rough I  was lost Now I'm found Ever since you've been around You're the women that I want So yo, I'm putting it down.  **zeus**Subj: :)Date: Jun 20 00:17*takes off his socks and moans erotically*  I keep thinking about sex and it's your fault! **worm**Subj: hallelujahDate: Jun 20 00:35 there was a time you let me know  whats real and going on below  but now you never show it to me, do you?  remember when i moved in you? the holy dark  was moving too.. and every breath we drew was  hallelujah.   maybe theres a God above and all I ever learned  from love was how to shoot at someone who out drew you.    its not a cry you can hear at night, it's not somebody  whos seen the light.. its a cold and its a broken hallelujah.   -josh **worm**Subj: hehDate: Jun 21 01:56think yer slick blockin tells and emotes? forgot about mail eh? :P glad to see this is how it'll be. take care .. cassi **x**Subj: shardak gwizesCc: (To: pestilence) khrell,caelin,vital,laeraDate: Jun 27 23:07all shard wizes have been removed temporarily. i'm going to be recoding part of the guild.  **zeus**Subj: le happy sighDate: Jul 16 00:42I so much more than love you and miss you :) *hugs* pleasant dreams my sweet princess **stark**Subj: yoDate: Jul 17 14:56Still poking around...
