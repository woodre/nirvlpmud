Based upon that, my discussion with you, and your reputation, I believe that you will make an excellent addition to our Family.  You have my bite however, you must seek out another two bites.  I would suggest that you talk with Garald next.  I will, of course, do all within my power to persuade my Brothers and Sisters of your suitability for our guild.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Until then, I remain your Alexis, Belle Morte **"
