He also has your component pouch and all that stuff for Fallen (I never played Fallen so I don't know anything about it) Kudos! **riddick**Subj: Fallen TitleCc: (To: fred) riddickDate: Mar 17 15:07Hey man, not sure if you are maintaining all of Zeus's guilds, but i was wondering if i could request a custom title, since i have now mastered the guild. I have clan called Umbra, and my attack is the ShadowFlame.  This is also my clan object.  I was thinking that maybe something along the lines of: Riddick the UMBRA <> DOMINUS (shadowflame)   Riddick the(white) UMBRA(gray) <>(red) DOMINUS(gray) (shadowflame)(hred) Let me know if this doesnt work.  Thanks man 8* **"
