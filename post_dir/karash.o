I'm not sure of the normal process, so I wrote up a lengthy summary of the area and the ideas/theme behind it, plus a list of all the objects and the objects with which they interact.   You can find the summary at /players/karash/Outpost/OutpostSummary and the list of objects at /players/karash/Outpost/OutpostDirectory  All of the objects are located in the file /players/karash/Outpost which is mentioned in the summary.   The entrance to the area is /players/karash/Outpost/rooms/so01.c  Please let me know if you need anything else in the meantime. Thanks Karash **star**Subj: My to do listDate: Aug 15 14:10I just checked my mudmail, and someone did beat you to it.  Thought I'd let you know you're officially number 2 on the list.. laff.  I'll get to them as fast as I can.  There's a lot going on in my real life at the moment.  If I get too far behind I'll get some help, so hopefully you won't have to wait too long.  Star **star**Subj: Sorry I disappearedCc: (To: xiu) karash,jareelDate: Sep  2 10:29Real life kicked my butt in the last week or so, so I am very sorry I wasn't here checking code.  I'll be around more after this, though I'm not sure it's quite through with me.  I still need to get Tyler a doctor appointment and get him to a neurologist about his migraines. I do plan to get my to-do list started within the next few days.  As soon as I feel a little better myself.. **karash**Subj: New AreaCc: (To: dragnar) karashDate: Sep 14 11:00Hey, Dragnar, I've made all of the changes/corrections (and more).  Check out the txt file of your area review - I documented all changes/corrections on that text file for your review.  /players/karash/Outpost/Outpost_gnar.txt Thanks! Karash **dragnar**Subj: ExitsDate: Sep 15 18:51As far as blocking exits, just add an action to the room for the dirs, and check the name of this_player() and if it is your mob, deny them moving (i.e. return 0) **karash**Subj: Nightshade Realm UpdgradeCc: (To: dragnar) karashDate: Oct 13 16:11Okay, Dragnar, I will probably continue to test while it is in the review process, but I'm pretty much done.  I'm not sure who or how you want this reviewed since these objects are not currently in the Nightshade realm at this time.  The reviewer will have to clone most of these items to test them, unless they are located in a room that I also modified, then you can clone the room.  Once they are reviewed and ready to be moved to Nightshade's area, I will have to modify some paths in a lot of these objects, but the folders they are currently in does match the folders they will be placed in Nightshade's realm.  I have a huge summary of all the objects I touched (either modified or created) with some descriptions.  Every object I touched is located at /players/karash/nightshade/updated/ with subfolders that match where the folders they will go under nightshade's directory.  The summary is located at: /players/karash/nightshade/updated/nightshade_updates_summary.txt  Let me know what you think! Karash ? **dragnar**Subj: Red DragonDate: Oct 17 13:48 I fought the dragon today as myself, noticed later there was some stuff in the debug.log file. in the debug.log file.  Bad argument 1 to call_other() Current object was players/karash/nightshade/updated/mons/red_dragon#1148, line 48 "heart_beat" in "players/karash/nightshade/updated/mons/red_dragon.c" ("players/karash/nightshade/updated/mons/red_dragon#1148") line 266 Heart beat in players/karash/nightshade/updated/mons/red_dragon#1148 turned off.  I love what you did with this mob! --Gnar **karash**Subj: debug.logCc: (To: dragnar) karashDate: Oct 17 23:20Hey, how do I access the debug.log file? Thanks! **dragnar** Re:   debug.logDate: Oct 18 12:22more /debug.log :) **dragnar** Re:   debug.logDate: Oct 18 12:22As you sponsor, that is a big fail for me, you not knowing how to  do that lol **dragnar**Subj: ApprovalDate: Nov 15 12:12Hey, Hey, I moved the approval that I emailed you a few days ago into the /nightshade/updated directory. Let me know what you think.  You only have a few tweaks, once you are ready you can switch the directories over and I'll move everything in Thanks Man.  free blue --Gnar/John **karash**Subj: Approval NotesCc: (To: dragnar) karashDate: Nov 15 14:34Dragnar - I added comments to your notes addressing the issues you had. Check out my responses and let me know if you still need me to make any changes, specifically to the wands and the mobs you stated needed another special.    Thanks, man! Karash **dragnar** Re:   Approval NotesDate: Nov 18 16:02Hey,  I'm good with the mob changes. As far as the wands, the issue is that with 10 changes and the mobs resetting every hour it gives players a chance to get a bunch of wands. They do have pretty big drawbacks, but I think 10 charges every reset is too many. Is the reset in the chest object?  If so you can make the wands clone only once per boot and replace them with other booty so you can still have the mobs reset as normal.  Let me know what you think. If you want, bounce it off Fred and get his input, if he says yes I'm good with it. --Gnar **karash**Subj: Re: Approval NotesCc: (To: dragnar) karashDate: Nov 19 10:14Okay, I see your point.  Are you okay with giving each wand 5 charges then and keeping them on the same reset cycle?  Karash **dragnar** Re:   Re: Approval NotesDate: Nov 19 10:42Yep, I'm good with it. Start updating the paths and let me know which files I need to move over when you're done. --Gnar **"
