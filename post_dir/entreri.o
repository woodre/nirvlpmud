You set pk or go into a pk area andyou lose connection expect to die for it if you get caught.  Nothing was gayerthan finally running down a wizard alt and them pussying out by disconnecting.In the idea of the pk areas....have rooms with random directions.  Thinkmaledicta's mystic caves.  But the directions randomize so its harder to run. IE: Room has 4 directions N,S,E,W.  Here's my idea leave the same directions butcolor them.  South is always blue, red is north, etc.  So the exit is 2 southfrom your current position.  East is blue, N green, S red, W yellow.  So type Ebecause its blue = a south direction.Get the idea?Make it so command stacking your way through an area doesnt work.  Its all funand games to be able to run to pesty's shake shop in one second.  Yet as a pkerkeeping track of pker's coming for you lame that in under 2 seconds someone canbe in the same room as you.Pauses.  Takes 2 hb for doors to open.  Takes a hb for the key code to be putin, then accepted. Gotta wait 5 seconds for the random herd of cows to stopblocking the road.Eliminate pk gangbangs.  You can only be attacked by 2 at a time unless those 2ppl dont = your player levels. ie One 19+100 player vs 5 lvl 19's5 vs 1 still a gang bang but you get an idea of what i'm talking about.PK body guards.  XP them up like a wocket pet.  Useable in pk like a Neo's pet.For those of you without the neo pets. (heh)  Pet couldn't be hit unless it wasduring a round it attacked.  Area effect spells not sure on.  Pet couldn't beattacked.  BTW Neo's pet wasn't pk.Psychax**psychax**Subj: pk part 2Cc: (To: linus) earwax,dakeyras,forbin,mosobp,humble,pestilence,fred,mizan,jareel,coldwind,pike,cerberus,subotai,cooper,hoyle,sundin,greymir,symbio,fakir,snakespear,zeus,mode,wocket,jaraxle,vital,ravennight,blade,tony,usagi,psychax,entreriDate: Jun 20 00:54Use pk points for "buffs". 10 points for added hp regen for an hour.  15 for spregen.  Added Stats for a period of time.Add another proc to weapons.  I decide to burn 20k coins and add a Directdamage fire proc to my trusty trident of war.  Sadly the proc only lasts for anhour but hey its added damage.Add stuff for non-equipment using guilds something to pk for.  Its all good tohave the newest and best armors/weps but without a current wizard continuelymaking changes to adjust for the new items that kinda guild just cant compete. But thats one of their disadvantages!  Bullshit.  I'll gladly keep dropping xpinto a guild to add armors (ala rangers)Less dependence on all the same weapons/armors.  Who doesn't use an elementalarmor, a gordie stick, skates, bracers of speed, etc.  I'd like to see armors geared/enchanted vs those specific items.  I got achainmail +3 vs gordie stick +2 vs tsunami +1 vs player spells.Make the enchantments not last.  Maybe since the item is magic vs a gordiestick it will negate all damage from a gordie stick for the round the armor"procs".THE ENDPSY**devi**Subj: PropositionCc: breetiDate: Aug  8 20:31I ran into some Mizan trouble and both my Icy swords kinda wentPOOF.
