Youcan choose to remain in the guild but will have very limited guild skills.I'm sorry for this inconvenience.  You can also choose to leave_guildyou will lose no xps or stats or lvls, however you won't get your guild xps restored.I have that information stored so when i reopen the testing if you wish to continue to test you will have your current status reinstated. Any questions or problemsfeel free to mail me.Pestilence**fakir**Subj: kidsCc: **Date: Dec 18 14:35pblast can restore your kids if you mail him fast enough with names and levels, etc. Make that Boltar...no pblast...heh. **"
