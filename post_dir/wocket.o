The guild was originally created to Daranath who got the code to beta before he left the mud.  Mythos then gave the guild to  me and I was originally intent on just doing some quick fixes to get it to a release state, but being me I had some artist things I wanted to fix and one thing lead to another and basically did a complete rewrite of the code and design of the guild.  The character sebastian was going to be an ingame character that I played who was going to act as the 'scribe' of the guild and impart the lore of it to the other players. Unfortunately inactivity made that not as good as a goal as it originally sounded.  That character was eventually wiped and I since  recreated it, but have never brought it back to the state it was before.  I thought I would just share some of those tid bits about the history of the guild.  I also wanted to thank you for keeping it up to date.  It is always a shame when things wither just because of lack of simple maintance.  Keep up the good work.   -wocket **"
