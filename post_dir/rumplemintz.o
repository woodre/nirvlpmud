I ran through the village and by the time I got to chamber of realms I went from full hp to 46 hp.  I just thought I'd let ya know that my criminal flag was tripped by sparring.

Can you shed some light on this? call_other("/bin/soul/_"+feeling, "broadcast_feeling", channel, targ)  The command in /bin/soul calls do_cmd, but I don't see how the "broadcast" function is passed as an argument.  Any thoughts? Thanks, --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: channel & walking deadDate: Feb  2 14:48Hey Rump, I want to open Walking Dead this week since the show is back on starting this weekend. I have fixed the callout issue and various bugs found during a few beta tests. The only thing I need you to re- check is I added some heals to some of the mobs in the town. Heals are in the /heals/mons directory, and the mobs are mons/guard, anthony, and oakley. I removed some of the gear from the guards. The others were no were near max coins so I didn't remove gear from them. Not having great coins was one of the biggest bitches I got from the beta. Let me know what you think.  I made a lot of progress on the channel daemon. Illarion helped me figure out how things were working, and I have the daemon now using code in the daemon to handle the feelings. I'm not 100% done but I'd say 75% of the way there. Some code will need to stay in std.c but I  think we'll be able to remove most of it.  Thanks, -- Gnar **dragnar**Subj: cd /players/dragnar/WalkingDead/Date: Feb  5 02:15Hey, please read /players/dragnar/WalkingDead/heals/mons/INFO.txt and let me know what you think. I believe it is closer to what you were looking for. I believe Jenny's area is way out of whack after talking to you the other day. Those painkillers are valued way too low.  Illarion daemonized the std.c object. I am not sure we even need to mess with the channel daemon now? If we leave "broadcast" the way it was it will call the function in std.c which now uses a daemon.  Let me know what you think.

I learn alot more that way, and Dragnar has been helpful providing examples, but I dont want to keep bothering him. I currently have about 40 rooms coded in /players/tristian/realms/supermax/rooms and I plan on finishing the area off with 2 more cell block wings, a  center section and the last leg of the prison which will be deathrow.  it will be a high level area similar to wings in Jennys with unique mobs. and it would go alot faster if i could look at code to try to figure out the some of the things i am doing. all in all between supermax and death row i am figuring 70+ rooms, 2 dozen mobs, maybe more and unique items and such.

I had to add /obj/player to the valid_exec function.    Int still seems to be 32bit.

I promoted pestilence and have him and shinshi doing the add_verb and add_xverb updates (there are a ton of them in the /player dirs).   I had to update exlv_guild. The m_values simlu_efun on LP is sorted, the efun on LD is not. It causes the exlv_guild to do all sorts of crazy things like give players millions of exp when they died.

In master.c the valid_read function is passed an object caller. The first thing that happens is a check is done to see if caller is master.c, if so it returns 1. The issue is caller is always (almost always?) master.c. I added code to write to a log file when the caller is master.c and it seemed to always write to it. Check /log/valid_read_gnar. I created an object to do a get_dir call (/players/dragnar/test/test). I also did an ls command which also does get_dir. In both cases caller = this_object(). I printed out the caller_stack in the log.  Let me know what you think. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: Bad file nameDate: Mar 11 17:11save_me in player.c checks to see if player level > EXPLORE || file_size("/players/"+name+".o") > 0, if so it does the save_object there was well.  The file_size call is making a call to make_path_absolute but because the file doesn't exist you get the Bad file name message. --John **dragnar**Subj: valid_write on 4505Date: Mar 15 11:41I think I found the major issue with valid_write. Previous_object on LD seems to be behaving differently. On LP if you do a command from a guild obj then that obj is always going to be the  previous_object in valid_write in player.c  However on LD that isn't the case.  A lot of the security for the players is based on the object that did the call. For example the dervish guild object will not allow players to write files anywhere except in the /players/guilds/dervish directory. I tried to set the previous object on 4505 to the object at the top of the stack, but sometimes it is /obj/master.c. I think the trick is to figure out how to handle this and we should be able to use the same valid_write code we are using on LP. Look at what I did in valid_write in player.c on 4505. It fixed the issues I was having with dreadbane for the mages guild.  However, I tried some of the cyber guild help files and the call stack looks totally different, so I'm not sure how to determine who the true caller obj should be.  **dragnar**Subj: /obj/shutDate: Apr  5 22:42Did you modify Armageddon? It is impossible to shutdown the mud at the moment. Usually I just do shutdown 10 or whatever but now it asks for a reason, but it never does the shutdown.

Seems like the same issues we have run into previously. Dragnar is ok but players get a lot of bad file name errors for write_file. Thanks Rump. **dragnar**Subj: SecurityDate: Jul  2 15:01Why don't we scrap security. Only give seniors and higher write access to everything. Make everyone else code on another port and request updates to in game items. They code in their sandbox, we move it when it is approved/tested.  Would of course not allow any non-senior wizards to fix issues that come up. Also, moving code would require server access.  Not sure if the benefits outweigh the drawbacks... **illarion**Subj: channelsCc: (To: dragnar) fred,rumplemintzDate: Jul 18 14:37So, the valid_channel function in channel_daemon checks against FREE_CHANNELS instead of ALL_CHANNELS.

For example, mages, samurai, shardak, etc.  Since the player pool is so small, I feel there is no point in having the requirement of waiting for someone else to login in order to enjoy 25% of the content of the MUD.  Any objections?   **oberon** Re:   Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: vertebraker) dragnar,darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Sep 29 19:01I think sponsorships are an interesting aspect.. I'm not sure if I like seeing it deleted all together. So, as an idea, what if we keep sponsorship alive on those guilds but add a mob that will sponsor somebody for 80k coins. Now you have a way for people to buy it, or do it for free if a player is on.  - Oberon **rumplemintz** Re:   Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: oberon) vertebraker,dragnar,darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Oct  7 14:01I like the idea of the coin cost, as it's insanely easy to coin up these days anyway.  I do agree that it should be changed. **dragnar**Subj: room.c Cc: (To: fred) rumplemintz,shinshi,sami,vertebraker,oberon,darkfire,mosobpDate: Oct 18 21:59I always liked the way some rooms that had call_outs in them shut them off when no players were in the room. I finally got around to adding the functionality to room.c.  You can use the new: set_call_out( string co, int interval, int rand_interval )  to set the name of the call_out function, the interval and random interval. . In the inherited room you do set_call_out in the reset, then define the function that will be the target of the call_out. I'll put an example in /doc/build/room/call_outs. --Gnar **"
