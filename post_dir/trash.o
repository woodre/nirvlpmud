So H broke things off yesterday and it kinda got me down the way the past month has gone. Mike and Geoff made me go out last night and I guess I just kinda lost all if it in alcohol and that wasnt a good thing. Been sick all day. Just dont really feel like doing much of anything. Wish I would have seen ya around when you werent idle, but guess you prolly are gone for the night now. Hope to talk to you soon. Hope you are doing ok. Miss the late night laughs. See ya soon V. **sparkle**Subj: HeyDate: Nov 14 00:40I'm gonna be around, just gonna lay down a few. Send me a tell and give me a few minutes if you come back.
