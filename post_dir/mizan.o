It happened some time ago and i'm a bit fuzzy on the details, and at this point I do not care.  But... when faced with multiple seniors that caught him doing stupid, relatively minor things, he chose not to come clean but instead spread "political" crap accusing me and others of framing him, among other things.  He didn't even keep his story straight and never apologized to anyone.  This part- I do remember clearly as I was often the target of "politics".  He went down by a thousand cuts and can stay down as far as i'm concerned.  If he wants to be a shardak guild wiz- sure. But no levels greater than 30, so he can't see other wizs' files, and can remain focused on his own stuff.  If he hadn't been such an ass about things in the past and just said "yeah i goofed" i would have a more favorable opinion, but too bad.  Just my own "political" opinion. **worm**Subj: sheeshCc: boltar,fred,pestilence,vertebraker,angel,wormDate: Aug 13 01:59exactly what the subject says.. sheesh, i love mizan, i wouldnt have his babies.. but only because i'm far prettier than him. but i know the story, i've heard a more straight forward version. one from everyone involved on the 'guilty' side. there is one simple fact i will beat until the end. mizan has code used all the time,  so does he. they're both good guys in my book. they could both do whatever they wanted, even desting me, zapping me, jailing and or banning me.. and i'd just be glad it was one of them. one of our own.. one who's been here for the long haul. i'm not taking sides.. and i'm only some lowly player, but i think he deserves respect. and everyone slips up. cheating? seriously? .. i could toss names but i wont. but there are others who've cheated.. and would never be punished. Pestilence has been.. and if you all knew the whole truth behind why, you'd all (Mizan included) shrug it off. No, he didnt come clean.. and now he's paid.

I feel that rather than reopen old guilds, or open new guilds, that touching up current guilds, adding new things to them would catch the attention of ppl we already have back playing. It would be awesome to assign wizards to each guild, trying to update them in anyway we can. That would build intrest in playing/killing more.. at the  same time, ppl would be out leveling more, helping lower levels etc. Just bringing a fresh feel back to the game. Artos feels having a PK Tourny once in awhile would help. He pointed out attracting pkers, ppl who like to chat a lot over public channels would also help gain intrest for players in the game, attracting old/new players etc. Honestly, I think the MUD has already taken a breath of fresh air and is on a nice roll. I'm just hoping we can all pitch in, in any way we can to help it keep on rolling. So, even though i'm just a player, I figured i'd start pestering you guys with ideas.. some i'm sure you'll blow off, others I hope you'll consider. Although, once again, i'd like to point out one thing.. I know rules are in place and need to be followed, but I think warnings should be given. Like a strike 1,2,3 and you're jailed.. rather than just jailing and banning.  To tell you the truth, losing just one player could lead to possibly losing his friends. While we're trying to revive this place, I think every player counts. I know Bolts ends up at the end of all the drama, so I think the wizards should handle most things themselves, without jailing when possible. I'm just hoping we can find a way to keep it fun for everyone involved.  Anyway, thanks for your time.. if you've read this far. ;)  -me *8 oopsee **nefarious**Subj: Request to wiz.Cc: (To: fred) boltar,mizan,xDate: May  6 17:45I have no idea why you all feel the need to discriminate against me. I have been contributing in everyway I can for quite sometime now. Admit it or not, I am the one who started gathering back up players for your game.

I hope this isn't too much to ask (it most likely is) But I was wondering if you wouldn't mind helping me with a mob that I'd like to wander around the MUD... Kinda like Harry. It's Dane Cook. I want him to just randomly walk around and follow people and when they're pestered enough and they try to kill him, I wanted Dane to say("Yeah? Well you're just like " +wizname+".\n"); where wizname would be a random wizard name that I can put in Then he would leave 5 minutes after this all takes place, you'll get a message something like: "You begin to think back on what Dane said to you...." Then 3 minutes after that, you'll receive another message something like: "What did Dane MEAN when he said that?!? Is it an insult???" Then finally, it'll clone him after 2 more minutes (10 minutes total for this event) Or rather it'll clone another Dane mob (that i havent coded yet) in which he's eating ramen noodles or something and then it'll just start writing write("WHO BOUGHT THE FUCKING NOODLES? WHO BOUGHT THEM? JUST TELL ME WHO BOUGHT THE FUCKING NOODLES AND I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.\n"); And random crap like that.  I know this is a lot to ask =P I actually asked Chip for his Jason code and he said he didn't mind if I used it And I had it working for awhile but the way he had it set up was that you had to attack the mob and the mob would remember your name and "stalk" you around the MUD no matter where you went. I had it working for awhile but you had to calm the room... I asked Fred if he knew, he said he didn't know. Chip said you helped him with it So I thought I'd give it a try. If not, whatever...

I'm glad that you've been inspired to code a guild. Just so you know, I am not considered one of the more technically hardcore coders on here. My role is more like the ISP for the game, and I try to keep my hands off many issues. Helping new wizards however is one of those things that I like to do however.  Typically I do not handle the vetting process for new wizards- that's something that either Boltar does or is done in a collective with other wizzes. In the past I usually didn't get directly involved so I simply don't know how that works. The truth is I don't know what to do from this point on so I will involve other wizards.  That having been said, what I do know about coding of guilds and realms is that it is always better to start off coding a realm first. I don't  mean this to discourage you, because it's almost never the technical issues of a guild that are daunting- but guilds require intimate experience with the object libraries (sort of like APIs) that coding a realm does not. I speak from experience in this regard.  Since you have previous programming experience, the transition to LPC should be fairly straightforward. It is a mostly object oriented environment with a simplified C-like language syntax. However the object libraries and APIs were constructed in a very organic manner, so imagine an environment that has mixtures of programming philosophy and is generally not documented very well, or at all.  My recommendation is to come up with a realm idea first and develop that into a solid proposal. With a good area in place, a guild tends to become the next logical step and has a strong platform to build on. Also, the process of building an area also grants familiarity with what is legal in the game, and what sort of things might or might not fly. Anyhow, take this with a huge grain of salt, as it is subjectively my experience on this.  I will talk with Boltar and other wizzes, so stay tuned. Thanks! -miz/ aka Tijger **trojan**Subj: Hmm.Date: Jul 13 23:13I wasnt ASKING you for crap man.. or even talking 'shit' to you. I was simply venting to someone I consider a friend.

I am not messing with you because quite frankly you are not worth the time for me to mess with. I do not mess with people like you because there is frankly no real motivation to do so.

I am requesting for all my equipment back and the coins i had on me at the time which was about 45000 or so and that those mobs not be allowed to continue to follow players around to loot the corpses that the players have legally killed. **fzendatu**Subj: domo-kun contCc: boltarDate: Aug 29 01:15the equipment i had on me at the time of my death was the complete set of thunder air,ted skates,natures orb,blocker,golden earring,gogetas ring which i don't care about since it was crafted for gogeta for some reason or other,shield of tears flowing scarf,grey sash, and i believe that was all I feel that is only fair considering what had happened Thank you in advance if this can be accomplished. I am sure you all know the rest of my alts if i am on  another character at the  time just let me know if i get my stuff back and i will log this one in. **mizan** Re:   domo-kunCc: (To: fzendatu) mizanDate: Aug 29 18:01When I receive messages from people with thinly veiled threats or outright call me out as being incompetent one of three things happens: 1) They are quietly deleted and ignored 2) They are posted up on our wiki for mockery across the wiz population 3) I get mad and do something irrational about it.  In your case, I present to you two options: a) Recompose your request in a more palatable and polite way. b) Suck it up and deal with the consequences of your actions.  There are things on this MUD which present a hazard or menace to all player characters, but one thing that they have in common is that YOU would have to do something or explore somewhere to provoke it.  I reserve the option to continue along with options 2) and 3) if  the situation requires it.  -m **fzendatu**Subj: domo-kunCc: fzendatuDate: Aug 30 00:22i am sorry about my mail to you i wrote that while i was very pissed off.  For that  I am sorry.  Now that i have had time to cool off I humbly request that w/e you can /will do will be greatly appreciated.  As far as the provoking I did no such thing all i did was kill the xetras in the Blue crystal. After i killed one of them domo-kun looted the corpse.  Had i known that he was not the pushover of some of your other mobs i would never had attacked him to begin with.  After realizing that  he was not the pushover like some of your mobs are i tried to run but got followed all the way to my casa room and was killed.This is not a character i play very  often and the equipment I had was VERY hard to come by as well as as the coins that would have been provided from the crystals that the xetras drop.  I needed those coins as i had very little to start off with.  But with that being said I will close this with another apology and a request of at least have the mobs that are on  pillage mode not be able to touch something someone has killed for a few heartbeats to give the player time to at least get off there aliases for corpse drain and take  all Thank You Fzendatu **silverpaw**Subj: CharactersCc: lokDate: Aug 30 11:43Was just wondering if you had talked to peoples as was curious about a couple things i wanted to talk to you about.

I don't really care about what he does or says, and I have encouraged other wizzes not to provoke him by even responding to anything he has to say. Yes. That is my official stance. Just flat out ignore him no matter how irritating his words may be. Don't bother him, don't help him, don't hinder him, just ignore him completely. But let him speak.  I know it sounds counter-intuitive but I encourage you to do the same, and even spread the word about it to others if possible. Delorean may be a griefer and a selfish little twit, but he has a right to login to this game and play.  In the past I have not been as saintly and approachable either, and I recognize that. In the past I have done things like delete his characters or siteban him and it has not changed his behavior. When I returned to here a few months ago,  I made an offer to start off with him on a clean slate. I believe I have held my end of the bargain. However he has chosen not to. But I'm cool with that.  Rather than wipe him off the MUD i chose a different vent for dealing with him. I made a comic which features some of his antics, of which there are two episodes so far visible at:  http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/a-barycentric-griefing-motion/ and http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/the-third-fastest-thing-in-the-world/  Again, I encourage others to simply ignore him, and let peace and contentedness be in your soul rather than pure rage that (insertDeityHere) has forsaken us and left us such a miserable little shitfucker to suffer with. Delorean and his kind are a vital part of this MUD's ecosystem, as we need diversity... strong PK'ers, roleplayers, socialites, coders, whining douchebags- We need them all.  There is a saying in Arabic which does not translate well, but I'll try- "I let my enemies dine at my doorstep because it is my pleasure, God willing." So paraphrased my take on that is: "I let Delorean play here and speak what he wants because it is my pleasure."  So you know what to do. The next stupid thing he does, mudmail me a transcript and I will credit you appropriately on my next comic strip(s).  Thank you for reading. -Miz **star**Subj: Gideon and meDate: Sep  9 00:48I had a chat with Worm as soon as you left.  I admitted to him that I messed up, and apologized for it.  He said that he was already over it, and was working on the changes I asked him to do.  He had just needed to vent, since he was never one to hide his feelings. I told him that he might be over it, but that I am still working to fix it, because I know I messed up. While we were chatting, he asked me about one of the things I asked for, and I had another look at the room for him.  It looks like it's all shaping up nicely.  Mis-spellings are gone, and the grammar looks fixed. He said he has lots of ideas, but that coding them is like chewing glass.  It's not a process he enjoys.  He said what he'd really like to do is something like me, but also to run a character through things and find stuff.  I did run it by him that he would be great for going over things to find code that can be abused.  Once he has a promo or two and can more easily see other people's code, I do think he'd be quite happy to help that way. Anyway, that's what came of it between the two of us.  We're quite at peace, as we usually are, and he's off killing things on WoW. I'm going to have a look at my approvals document because I think there are a few things I left out that I've later remembered I ought to put in.  If we can get a real and working standard ironed out, then it will be better for everyone.  As it stands now, if one level 100 has a reputation for being tough, people will go to another..  like when people go to a driver's license center where they've heard they don't make you parallel park to pass the test..  *8) We have standards for so many other things..  it only makes sense.  -Star **star**Subj: Wiki stuffDate: Sep  9 02:00I don't know how to do any of this ya know..  I saw the thing about coding rules and regs, and the question mark next to it that would theoretically allow me to create the page..  assuming I knew how.  I do know how to create web pages, but this thing doesn't look anything like that.  And even if I added my approval standards to the rules and regs part, that's only half the battle.  If I want to let people know I messed up, what I'm planning to do to fix it, and that I'm right now working to standardize things and prevent it from being a future issue, I don't know where to put it or how.  I was considering putting it in the blog part, but I don't know if anyone at all reads those.  Also, when I asked Khrell, he said he hadn't been on the wiki at all since the 1st, and that he's not even sure how often people read it anyway.  I'm not upset with you for telling me how it is right now, cos like I said, I agree with you.  I know I need to prove that I'm worth keeping around.  But now, since I don't know where to put it, and I don't know if anyone will read it, I am frustrated and upset in general.  I want people to give me a chance, and I want them to know what I'm working on, but I don't know how to get it out there for anyone to see..  I'm trying..  if I can't tell them and don't know who they are to tell please make sure they know..  -Star **artos**Subj: ThanksDate: Sep  9 03:23Hey man, first off, I wanted to thank you.

I am trying to change for the better, as should you.  I'm bringing this up as I read your mail about not knowing how to use the Wiki, and not being sure if other people will read it, and not thinking it may be worth the effort to do X, Y, or Z, or whatever. I started from being sympathetic to your feelings last night to being somewhat disappointed. Right now I feel as if you aren't really going to change, and that admitting wrongdoing was just a fancy dog and pony show to get me off your back, and release you with just a slap on the wrist. However, as that stands I want you to please prove me wrong.  Don't assume that by admitting guilt and then pouring any of life's uncertainties or confessions on me that things will magically get fixed. Rebuilding the trust of people who you've rubbed the wrong way takes work and effort. For example my image of being a gladiator turning into a mediator did not take overnight- it is a process and I can't say that I am a statesman or even a mediator just yet. I have a long way to go.   Tools like the wiki take time to use and develop. It is not going to happen right away. I fully do not expect people to just jump on board with it until some critical mass of usefulness is acheived. I am far from an expert with wiki usage. In corporate life, I have set up one everywhere I have worked and it turned from a 'wtf' project to a useful part of a company's infrastructure through trial and error, hard work, and a little bit of luck. The best way to learn is through failure.  Likewise in analogy, my Gary Hobostein comic is not going to be a smash hit right out of the box. If i fret about not having enough readers, or not knowing where to advertise, or having uncertainties of what the next storyline should be- then I might as well just not do it at all and have ZERO chance of making it successful.  So I am not trying to scold you, or motivate you, or challenge you  into stepping up to the plate and running with this L100 realm approval thing. Echoing the beginning, this defeatist attitude must end. What happens from that point forward is entirely up to you.  Thanks for reading, -tij **gideon**Subj: FavorDate: Sep 10 15:27 Hey man.. you know in the past we've all done things that  werent 'right' .. made mistakes, etc. At the same time, you, myself  and others have seemed to move on.. becoming better members of Nirvana  and better ppl in general.

Perhaps later down the road, but not now.  I appreciate that you are willing to put yourself on the line for her, but I ask you one thing. What is SHE willing to put on the line for you? Would she be as willing to help you if your places were swapped?  Jen has really been nothing but trouble on here. You may feel that by asking other wizards around, that their response of 'sure, no problem' equates to outright or tacit support for her. I can tell you that the people I have spoken to hope that she does not return, and I can only speculate that some have basically passed the buck in anticipating me being the 'goalkeeper' and ultimately voting 'no'.  I tell you this not to be a dick, I am telling you this because I feel that other people don't want to hurt your feelings. They have their own reasons for saying whatever they said. You and I are just going to have to respect that. I have been asking other wizards for their opinions No offense, but I cannot really consider the opinions of Fred or X very highly on this. They are awesome people, but honestly those two guys are the most forgiving and knowingly do not have to deal with cleaning up any messes.  You may ask what Jen has done recently to warrant this continued mark against her- well, I'll tell you what I know verifiably.  - The note that Illarion posted in the green regarding misinformation   being spread about guild nerfings- This seemed to have been caused   almost entirely by outright fabrications she had spread to others.   This sort of bullshit is extremely damaging, not because we run a   corporation, or because we have trade secrets- but because it affects   the player base negatively. All of the hard work you have had in   trying to bring people back is directly threatened by her actions.   This to me is a very serious offense. She may counter otherwise, but her   mouth is a serious, serious liability to the MUD. End of story.  - It has come to my attention that the only thing Jen seems to enjoy   doing online is figuring out who other people's second characters   are. This is not the sort of behavior that inspires any faith for   those who are wizzes. I say this in the tone of wondering if you   would willingly hire a petty thief to work in your shop. I'm not   implying she is a thief of course, but implying the personality   conflicts. You know what i mean.  I might have missed other things, but this is what comes to mind in the short term. Now i'll make a subject change... continued in part 2... **mizan** Re:   FavorCc: (To: gideon) mizanDate: Sep 10 21:55(continued)  You may feel Data is a fucking bonehead. You are entitled to your opinion. I will reserve judgement and give him a chance. He may be a total bonehead, or he may be a really nice guy. But you know what? Even if he is indeed a fucking bonehead, he wasn't causing me any problems as a player. When Fred reinstated him, I bitched about it, bitched at Data, but in the end came to the realization that I was wrong and should give him a chance. No matter how much of a douchbag some people may think Data is- at least we as wizards don't have to clean up after him. I know that you can recognize this. Jen causes me problems as a player. It's like following up constantly with her spilling wine. They very well may be small compared to the the collasal oil spill that was Earwax, but in her end it's like death by a thousand papercuts instead of by volcano.  She's going to have to prove that she's capable of change.

Don't take this the wrong way, and I know you won't.  I don't really appreciate how you're basically dismissing points that I brought up of Jen's poor behavior as invalid. By denying this instead of acknowledging it and moving on demonstrates poor good faith in trying to bring her back. So what if so-and-so did something worse in the past? Earwax is not Scathe is not Jen is not Hitlertampon. Seriously man, think about it. Comparing Jen's actions to other more serious offenses is a logical fallacy and I do not accept that kind of argument at all. There is a reason that Jen is not wanted in by senior wizzes and all that I ask of you is to accept that reason exists, is valid, and then we can continue working forward to address it. Is that too much to ask?  Without accepting the damage she has caused I cannot really go any further in clear conscience what's going on. If she cannot acknowledge this that's one thing, and it's between her and us. If you cannot, then moving forward is basically impossible.  Also, let's set one thing straight on this. Last night you tried to hold me hostage on a decision. By saying "i'm going to leave because I am not getting XYZ" shows your hand, and it's really not cool. If in the end for whatever reason Jen is rejected as a wiz, if you just pull off a "Well i'm done here for X number of months then" it will put a damper our working relationship. I did not try and broker a fair chance deal only for you to take your marbles home after the fact. If you feel like leaving if let's say a week or so from now Jen is turned down, don't waste my time now and let's just talk about things in a few months or so. I'm serious. Please.  Don't justify having Jen as a wiz being capable of helping you as being the end goal of everything. By saying that you may be sending  a slap in the face  to all the other wizzes who do try to help you with code.  I don't know if you realize that, i'm just saying.  Well with all of this said, I am trying to keep an open mind and work out some framework that might fit.

I dont want  any nerfing done.. and if you disagree or not, it was. The fact they  jumped back on the neos is amusing to me.. Neos had too many ppl behind  them, over powered as they are.. to get away with the nerf they did.. so   it was undone. and i know that for a fact man.  and the shard nerf, i was the first one to notice, first one to bitch,  being the leader of the guild, the one who plays everyday, etc.. you have  to know thats true.   then.. trying to find out who's alts are who.. again, thats all my fault. you acn even ask Star.. she got on me about asking Cypher (before I found out it was Khrell;) about asking him. A lot of the time I cam just turn   and ask Jen, hey.. who's so and so? and she either tells me, or asks around.  Now she's being faulted for it.. thats not right. If anyone is to be   punished for those things, it should be me.   Lastly, she may not be a great coder.. but she can code.. and she's a hard  worker. I cant say the same for a lot of wizards here.. even Lvl 100 Star.  So yeah, things did snowball outta control, i got pissed, you said calm   down.. i calmed down, Star pulls her shit, I got pissed, you said calm down,  I calmed down.. and now I have this great idea, that someone who can sit BY ME  irl, explain shit to me.. not send a mail saying " ;%Dgssg; - dsfsF ;636#ewt (return!) " just put that man!  .... I d verbally explained.  So yes, I had high hopes.. and yes, when I feel they were shot  down for reasons I didnt agree with fully, it was like the straw that broke  the camels back. I got fed up.. I havent seen 1 log.. or heard word of   any logs of her doing any of these crimes being brought forth.  I am right there most the time she MUDs...  So, i didnt get it. *shrug*  It's no attack on you, on the game, like I said.. if I get fed up with  the bullshit.. eyah, rather than stayin until I snap, get so pissed I go earwax crazy.. i'll just take a nice long vacation.  this mail is gettin long. we can talk more later. **shinshi**Subj: HeyCc: shinshiDate: Sep 11 19:13I read all the mails from Worm (/log/mizan.mbox) and I am quite insulted by what Worm said...

It meets all the nice new desc standards, and has been totally re-built to look more like a real preschool.  And yes, he did have some help with that, since he's never seen one and I have..  laff.  I've so far talked to Illarion, Fred, Khrell, and Angel about Padrone's stuff.  Oh..  and Sparrow too.  They all say they have no problem with me looking at his stuff with 1991 eyes.  Fred suggested I put it in with a notice that it's old code that was updated to work again and re-added. I honestly don't know if it was ever here before, but putting it that way explains the old-timey descs.  Angel said when he re-worked Mason's Bolts allowed him to do the same thing, for nostalgia's sake.  I'm still planning to talk to him, and I'm also still interested to know your thoughts on it, since if I do this I want as many people on the same page as possible.  I don't want people saying I'm favoring Padrone.  I don't even know who he was..  *8)  And now..

I am actually very indifferent, contented, and don't get upset at your temper tantrums like I used to. You may find this true as I have not had to dest, threaten, or resort to incredible amounts of violence against you since I came back. You can continue to hate my guts, and that's okay.  The purpose of this message is not to scold you, but only to try and bring some awareness to your attitude on the channels. You have a habit of  demanding service in a demeaning manner. I am asking you to take a step back and think of what you're doing. Typically it involves 'I need a wiz' followed by some expression of anger (hrmph) and something like foot tapping. Think about what kind of service you will get if you were at a bar, and did that. Would the bartender be as inclined to serve you? Probably not so much. To top this off, none of the wizards are not paid. People do this out of their own volition, as a hobby.  In the past wizards would get combative with you. But people have figured out that is a bad idea, so they just ignore you instead. I am writing to you because you seem to have pissed off the last of the wizards who were willing to help you. So I am asking you to just evaluate yourself and what attitude you are projecting when you need help. You don't have to resort to bullshit flowery language like "Hello kind ladies and gentlemen of the wizard department, can I get some assistance please"... I'm totally not asking you to do that. I'm just asking you to take a good look into the situation you're in. I wasn't kidding when i said you can continue to hate my guts until the day you die. But think about this for a moment. I don't hate you, and I don't have to vent any anger on your behalf. Doesn't that effort and energy you're spending on wanting my head on a stick seem a bit foolish, wasteful, and misplaced now?  I have taken steps to re-examine my policies in the past and present, and as you may have noticed, the tone of this mail is conciliatory and sincere. I'm not going to threaten, or raise my voice, or be a prick about things. I simply don't have to and life is too short for that kind of stuff.  Sincerely, -miz  **mizan**Subj: wormCc: (To: x) mizanDate: Sep 16 21:59X tells you: heh, btw. i told worm wizing bella would be a bad idea. she had her chance, twice. i told her it wasn't a good idea either.  Yeah, i washed my hands clean of all that. Worm still blames me for it anyhow because he didnt get what he wanted, right away. To be honest i am sick of trying to reason with him. Oddly enough you were one of the people who he told me would have zero problems if Jen was wizzed.

I want to granularize (sp?) some code and it makes logical sense to me to have them in directories that define what the modules are.  My goal isn't to change anything right away, but to bring some existing stuff up to date and make it easier to work with. The end result as far as players are concerned will not change - at least not with existing stuff.  Take for example /room/room.c - our base room object.  It contains all the code for exits, descriptions, light, properties, etc... but soem other objects use descriptions, properties.  Why not make those basic modules, that anything can inherit and use instead of having to code them into the base object.  These would fall into the /basic directory, as basic modules.  Anything that inherits multiple modules and defines some more functions that are unique to itself would become an example of a complex object (such as the room)  We could continue to keep these in /obj or /room - but i think those are better suited for actual items or rooms, not modules or base objects.  Of course there would have to be backwards compatibility built in or none of this matters.  Keep in mind i'm not trying to change the way anything that already exists works.  I'm just trying to lay some framework so that when we decide (if!) to move to LD that there is a solid foundation to work with for adding NEW stuff.  Hope that explains it!  Any questions let me know. **wicket**Subj: CrevanDate: Dec  4 16:51I still havent heard nothing back from you..... and was still wondering if it would be ok to play crevan or not. i understand your busy just wanted to get a yes or no from you! **boltar**Subj: rumplemintzCc: (To: fred) mizanDate: Dec  8 01:30 he needs level 1000 to do some work on the LD side.

The current server is a traditional Linux server running the CentOS 4.7 32 bit distribution. This is an 'end of life' product which has been superceded by the CentOS 5.x series.  What I am planning on doing is replacing the server with a newer machine that runs a hardware assist virtual machine environment. In English this means that the new machine will be hosting several virtual servers, one of which will be a dedicated machine just for Nirvana. These virtual machines run completely independent of one other. The changes will be imperceptible for most of you, but what is happening under the hood will be a major change. I am going to try migrating the OS to Ubuntu Server 9.10, 32 bit.  This will be a gradual process. First I need to move the server to the datacenter, the timeframe of which will be sometime in January.  Once the hardware is installed, the process of trying to move things over will start, and will be the 'slow-and-steady' parallel process.  I have zero intention of 'hot swapping' the old machine with the new without having anything tested. Things are subject to change but I will keep everyone posted.  Thanks, -tij **rumplemintz**Subj: /etc dirDate: Dec 23 13:14Can you create me an /etc directory at the root please, forgot to ask for that one when i was getting the others made.  Thx **rumplemintz**Subj: LDCc: (To: boltar) mizanDate: Jan  4 17:21It appears LD has been down since Dec 28th - can you restart it for me please?  Thanks! **highlander**Subj: quests and qptsCc: (To: boltar) illarion,mizan,star,fred,aingeal,vertebraker,highlanderDate: Jan  7 00:28ok i have done 2 quests tonight and only got credit for one of them in my points i did the phastasm quest and got 15 points for that one and i just completed the fiendsville quest i started with 106 qps and only have 121 phantasm quest is worth 15 and the fiendsville quest is 13 so i should have 134 qpts correct **boltar** Re:   quests and qptsCc: (To: highlander) illarion,mizan,star,fred,aingeal,vertebraker,highlanderDate: Jan  8 08:34goto to the clinic and register.

When a member of the Fallen has their spellpoints reduced to zero, they die. Instantly. This is part of the guild. I get it. This makes sense. However, when a Fallen has their PK set and are hit with "Lifeblood" (an item drom Omni, in Dune's tower) their (the fallen) spellpoints are instantly set to 0. This kill me immediately. Although, I don't know why I don't die in the Warp area (sets my spellpoints to -X). Would it be possible to edit "Lifeblood" so I can actually enjoy PK instead of worrying about being killed in 1 hit ?

If you throw armor into the mix it would be almost unbearable for a true newb. Maybe making the cost of repair or access to a qualified artisan be based on quality of the item. Make it more  expensive for high quality gear and not all smiths/armorers are up to the task. This will also help with an issue that I think we have: newbies with legendary gear. If they cant afford the upkeep they will be more likely to use gear that is more appropriate to their level.  Anyways that's my two cents **boltar** Re:   item decayCc: (To: sparrow) vertebraker,fred,boltar,sparrow,mizan,angel,vertebraker,rumplemintz,illarionDate: Feb 16 23:56 I am more with sparrow on this. too make things too much of a pain will only discourage people. good stuff should also last longer than cheap stuff.

In the dir /players/mizan/opl/generator are the tools i am currently coding/messing with to create the realm I am working on which is essentially just a giant, randomly generated maze.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/generate_maze.py is some Python code which currently is hardcoded to build 100 x 40 sized text mazes. The #'s are navigable areas, while the periods are no-man lands. It can be executed on a system with Python installed by invoking 'python generate_maze.py'.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/compile_maze.sh is just a little script that saves human-readable output of the maze to file, and also makes a copy which has no line breaks.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/process_maze.pl is then the perl code which actually builds up the .c room files which are all stored in /players/mizan/opl/CELLS. My code as usual is not formatted very cleanly because it's a work in progress. Essentially in this file, I read the output from compile_maze.sh, and iterate through all the rooms. I am basically counting exits- if I see dead ends, I randomly put a monster or something interesting in it. If I see intersections, I crowd them up with monsters that 'block' them. Things like that.  Additionally, here is something which may be of great interest to Verte. http://iceyboard.no-ip.org/dg/ This is an instant town generator, written in PHP. The code is available at http://iceyboard.no-ip.org/dg/?source=1  Also, a cave generator which I found lives inside /players/mizan/opl/generator/cave shows promise, it just needs some tweaks so that certain passages always remain 'open'.  I'm no expert on this stuff, it's been a bit of here and that tinkering for me so far.

Right now it is still in the planning stages but with Verte on board it should be moving forward rather soon. Here is the quick and dirty: Instead of cloning a monster, the room will load an encounter based on the level of the party leader. An encounter master daemon will be cloned to run the encounter, moving the party to a 5x5 room arena. The master will then build a list of npc's and distribute them throughout the arena. The daemon will keep track of the locations of the npcs as well as the players. The room long descriptions will actually request locations of the npc/player parties and display a map showing the location of each npc/party member. Npc's will be tagged with different roles such as Tank, Caster, Support and Ranged. A seperate daemon will take care of AI for the different  roles. Tanks will charge into battle, supports will buff and heal npcs, casters will cast spells (duh) and ranged will rain down projectiles as long as they are not engaged by the player party members. Also, players with ranged type weapons will be able to enter the same 'RANGED MODE' which will allow them to target a npc on the map and deal damage (albeit minimal) each round as long as they are not engaged directly. Experience will be handed out once the encounter is completed (no exp if the party flees) and treasure will be generated as well. I know this is very ambitious but I definately know it is within our ability. Ideally I think we should build it in a way that any wiz can use it, and customize it to his/her tastes with some sort of config file.  Like I said this is just in the planning stages but I  would like to get as much input on it as possible. I think this would help with the issue of players grinding in the same areas, for the same gear, and I've never seen this type of system on any other mud. Sparrow, the Scatter-brained Idea Machine **sparrow** Re:   Stuff i have been working on which may be useful to othersCc: (To: mizan) vertebraker,boltar,vertebraker,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,sparrow,angelDate: Feb 23 01:33Thanks Miz, I've been looking it over and I dig it.

Whereas I think that this is a cool ability, and I don't know what he had to pay to purchase this ability for his clan, I didn't like the fact that he could create one in the Village Green. As far as I'm concerend, these walls should only be able to block monsters or pkers. Normal players should be able to pass through a door in the wall or something. Major disruptions in gameplay could occur with walls being set up in the main village spine. Krylos was setting up a trap in case Heinous logged in, he  wanted to keep him from making it to his clan hall before he could attack him. I'm fine with that, it just blocks everyone else too from getting to the shop, advancement, post office, anything east of the green.  PK areas are open game, but I feel this should be changed a  bit.

It is a tactical  skill that can be used with mobs and PKers.   I only have one pk player but when I play I just  kill the wall and move on. not sure how hard  the wall is to kill at level 5 per say but 19 it is no big deal... **sparrow** Re:   Clan wallsCc: (To: angel) boltar,fred,vertebraker,illarion,mizan,rumplemintzDate: Mar  5 13:58All I really would like to see is non-pkers not be blocked. That is, unless it is a pk area.

Here's the entire story:  Heinous has been able to glean access on highlander's alt characters, I do not pretend to know how, that is neither here nor there. He had been using this information for the last few months to keep highlander from joining the sam's  with any character. This has been going on since before HL became a wiz. I had been warning Heinous that he needed to practice character seperation for the last three or four weeks. In the meantime I had been telling HL to focus on his area and give it time, that I would try to talk some sense into heinous. HL finished his area and put it up for approval. I'm assuming that he has been bored since then because the quest to gain a samurai had begun anew. He asked me if it would be alright if he logged in Kadaj with a new character just so he could chat on public channels to give the impression that it was not him. There was no equip/kills between the two characters. He spoke with Heinous and met the requirements to join the samurai. Afterwards I spoke with Heinous and informed him on what went on. All I wanted to show him was that HL could indeed create a character  that met his approval. I appologized to him for the  deception and I told him that he could do what he wanted with HL's character, he could remove him from the guild, he could let him fail on his own.  Maybe I was too tired, maybe I need to stay away from  players, none-the-less I made a bad decision. A lot of the time I am the only active wiz on, I get flooded with issues like this all of the time. Normally I tell those involved to forward it to Fred. Anyways I'm staying away from players from now on, I have too much work to do and too little time to do it. Vertebraker is only  involved because he backed me up after the fact. I try to be a good and fair admin, I go out of my way to make sure things run smoothly - this was not done to undermine the game itself, my intentions were fully disclosed. I understand that it is not my job to decide, or enforce for that matter, what is fair or right.  I accept full responsibility for this fiasco and await punishment. I just ask that I still have access to work on my projects. Ignorance is no excuse and I truly am sorry.

You are a senior wizard, I know who is greatly respected among others.  I should have taken the time and had the patience to listen instead of letting it get to me. Although I was being very truthful about the part about how I could care less about what you think of me as a wizard, I would like the opportunity to prove you wrong about me. Therefore I am, with great humility and respect, asking that you accept my apology and reinstate me as a wizard for Nirvana.  If you choose to do so I will promise that you will not regret it.  If you choose not to, then I am sorry for not having the chance to prove you wrong about me and my abilities.    Thank You either way you decide, James P Kluxen Highlander **mizan** Re:   apologyCc: (To: highlander) mizanDate: Apr  7 13:57You did take the time to write this up, so I owe you at least the time to properly respond without swearing up a storm like I usually do. Without further ado, my main complaints about you and why you have been dewizzed as as follows:  1) Lack of serious effort in your work,  2) No observed improvement in technical skills  3) Unwillingness to take accountability, and a bad attitude  4) Unwillingness to work independently before asking for assistance  I will address each of these opinions in order.  I see a lack of serious effort in your code because your descriptions within your realm put me to sleep. You said that this job at the call center was your dream job... but your area does not convey that in the least. To me it is not an appealing place to visit. On top of this, typos are everywhere, and these things are easily preventable with some spellchecking. Other wizards, particularly Sparrow and Illarion have tried with no success to impress upon you the balance of technical and imaginative skills. I understand that not everyone can excel in creative writing or technical coding, but in your case, I don't even see any real effort in trying to test your limits.  I see no improvement in your technical skills as a coder. I am not alone in this observation. Other wizards have had to explain simple concepts to you repeatedly, but you seem to keep stumbling on the same mistakes and not learning- or are unwilling to learn from them. Of course, nobody is perfect. Let's turn the tables for a minute and pick this from the other end. If I was an incompetent player character, and could not grasp the basics of fighting alongside your party, would you want me to tag along? Probably not, if I kept making the same mistakes all the time.  I see no accountability on your end for your actions. Not only are you making the same mistakes, but you blame others for them. Straight and simple- not everything is the MUD driver's fault. Not everything is another wizard's fault. Not everything is the lack of documentation's fault. You have failed to open your eyes and unlearn what you do here as a player, and relearn what new skills await as a wizard and programmer. Nobody in the wizard ranks wants to work with someone who just roundly blames others for their own mistakes.   Lastly I see no willingness on your side to try and focus on a problem before asking others for help. In programming, progress is not made in giant leaps and bounds, but in many small, incremental, MEASURABLE steps. You haven't even gone through the phase of beating your head against a problem which is initially difficult- you chicken out and ask someone else to fix it. This sort of display is the quickest, easiest way for other wizards to lose respect for you. As a player, that's like seeing someone who is too impatient or lazy to even take the newbie test or fight butterflies and ants in Softly's realm. Would you want to help such a person? Thought so.  So in closing, all I have to say is this. I know I can be a total asshole, and I don't dispute that... but in this case I am correct. You may think otherwise, but before you just give in and 'agree to disagree' I would invite you to take a SERIOUS self assessment of your actions. **valen**Subj: port policyDate: Apr 19 15:20I'm trying to finish up the setup with fmud.

I merely mved all of his characters to name.mizan.deleted.o in their respective dirs within /pfiles. I had to do this one other time in the past (oddly enough also at his request) and what will hopefully happen (again) is that he will come to his senses and ask them to be restored again.  Poor kid. He needs some serious help, and I think I make a very poor surrogate for real psychiatric care. I have no doubt he is going to scream for a little while and make a stink, but i've tired of coddling him of late. In fact all of the players have been putting up with him too. He's going need some 'tougher love' for a little while, and then when he asks for his characters back we'll probably get a few more months of humility and  relative peace again.  If anyone has a better suggestion/solution I am all ears :)  TL:DR - Hawkman threw a fit, wanted me to delete his chars.

On top of those whom he invited, I've invited close to 30 people myself, and hopefully they have more people they can invite as well. In light of this, and knowing I don't have that kind of access, we would like to request a couple of things from the administration, in hopes it will help bring life back to the mud. The first of those requests, is a significant increase, or even maybe removal, of the limit on the number of players that can be in a party. If even half of the people invited make it, there will be 15+ people on at one time, many of whom we can surely say would love to socially group together, definitely with more than 5 to a group. Or, as an alternative (I'm not sure how hard it would be to do by comparison), maybe make it so you can link groups together. Like, form 2 5-person parties, and link them so the channel and experience gains are linked between the groups. Without the social aspect of the mud, it won't go very far in the way of trying to bring it back from the dead, and this sort of thing would help incredibly. The other request is in regards to the alignment killing restriction of Power Rangers. Even if it's just for the reunion day, we would like to request this restriction be lifted, as I know for a fact several of the attendees will be playing their Ranger characters. With this restriction lifted, even if it is just for a day, it will help as far as not limiting where and what these groups (or hopefully, one really big group! lol) can go after. Rangers are generally limited to barely more than half of the mud's npcs, and this would take much of the fun from the reunion day's attentees, knowing they only have a small amount of stuff to do, then waiting for respawns and such. Lastly, this is more of a personal request, if there's anyone you all know, that we were unable to get ahold of to let know this reunion is happening, please take a moment to pass along word of the event, its date, and if they haven't been around since the address changed, the new one of course! Many thanks for the time and help in this from you all. This will hopefully be a day to remember of Nirvana's already colorful history! Hope to see you all there! Sincerely, Chip **boltar** Re:   Mud reunion on Sunday Feb 17, 2013Cc: (To: chip) fred,sparrow,mizan,rumplemintz,illarion,x,vertebraker,angelDate: Feb 11 09:08Paragraphs please.

When Mondar stole his corpse he went ballistic.  He insisted that mob does not steal corpses, etc..  You know how he is.  A group of players offered to kill Mondar for him, and he turned on them and cussed at them, telling them they were only in it for the exp.  He then logged off.  The group did kill Mondar, and left Whitehawk's possessions lying on the ground there.  Whitehawk logged back in tonight.  Mj told him that he can go get his stuff before reboot because they killed Mondar.  Whitehawk immediately cussed out Mj on the star line, called him a "fag boy", and said he takes orders from no one.  Mj attempted to explain that he was not giving orders, but Whitehawk was very nasty about it, and then logged out again.  I realize that we are all familiar with Whitehawk's tantrums. I let you know about this one because I sent him a message letting him know that Mondar does indeed steal corpses, and it was not a bug.  I furthermore informed him that he would be sorry if he ever spoke to one of my children that way again.  I would not condone him speaking to anyone that way after the person told him, but I'm sure he will see this as outright favoritism and complain to you. Perhaps I should have worded it differently, and told him he'd be sorry if he talked to people that way again, because it's harassment, as well as being not at all nice.  But due to the way I worded it, I thought I better warn you there may be an upcoming tirade. rl 20 him speaking to anyone that way after the person helped him, but I'm **rumplemintz** Re:   WhitehawkCc: (To: star) mizan,rumplemintz,boltarDate: Dec  4 14:57I really have no problem if he wants to act that way, as I see it as venting, but using cuss words on a public channel besides risque is illegal (even the start channel).  So you could do something about that.  But threatening for RL legal stuff such as harrassment just doesn't seem to fit.  If he wants to be a douche, then I think he should be allowed to be a douche.  I know you're being protective of your family, and I'm not sure how I would react in the same situation, but I just feel there needs to be some separation from RL on here.  It's an escape, and is meant to be fun, for everyone.  If fun for Whitehawk is being a dbag, then so be it.  There are ways to ignore people if they are ruining your own fun.  Just brainstorming here, ignore at will  :)  **star** Re:   WhitehawkCc: (To: rumplemintz) mizan,rumplemintz,boltarDate: Dec  4 15:00I actually wasn't talking about RL legal harassment.  I'm not sure that fits here.  But I thought there was some rule about not treating others like that in the game either.  At least players always scream about it when someone treats them badly.  At any rate, I'll keep in mind the cussing on public lines rule. I wouldn't jail him for any personal reason, and if I did feel he needed something done to him, I wouldn't do it myself since it would look like favoritism.  I just didn't appreciate his actions, and I let him know it.  I let all of you know in case he decided to complain about me. **star**Subj: My chars and gearCc: (To: boltar) fred,mizan,rumplemintzDate: Dec 25 19:35Just in case someone checks the gear sharing log..

I know because I just happened to finger him for another reason.  Just after that time, he committed suicide. He is now level +42.  Somehow he dropped 14 levels from one death.  I did check the death log and it shows a loss of 2779622 exp.  I have no idea how 2.7 million drops him 14 levels.  I'm sure before you get this he will have gone out fighting again, so his exp before suicide was 34779622. Afterwards it was 32000000.  Nothing in this seems to add up..  Star **rumplemintz**Subj: RE: Shojiro has an odd issueCc: (To: star) fred,boltar,mizan,shojiroDate: Jan 21 11:56After extensive looking, it appears that Shojiro quit the Vampire guild when he had 46372829 exp. Leaving that guild incurs a penalty of 1/4 exp (among a bunch of stat losses as well). 46372829 / 4 = 11593207 And 46372829 - 11593207 = 34779622  (or level 19 +44) When he Suicided, it dropped the max 2 levels to 19 +42 - which is 32000000 XP.  Hope that clears it up.    -- Rumplemintz **boltar**Subj: simulCc: (To: rumplemintz) mizanDate: Mar 27 11:19 mud was broken this morning.  In the process of trying to fix i I lost your backup simul_efun.c.check_file.   So what I did is put the check_file simul efun inherit back in. commented out a file_size inherit. and put the check_file.c file back in place.
