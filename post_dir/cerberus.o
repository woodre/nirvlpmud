In any case, that's what this is about.  The way I see it, PK is lacking for the following reasons:Risk without rewardPulling kills without a gangbang - people run/quit instead of dyingLearning curve is steep...it's harsh to learn, and dying sucksPK without risk sucks - rangers just get another ranger to kill them     and unset their pk - we've all seen this heh     (that was just an example, other guilds do it of course)PK tends to be dominated by packs - shards together, ninja together, etcSimply no reason to set - why bother, don't get anything from itLow playerbaseThose are the primary issues, at least that I can come up with right now.If there are others, let me know, but I think those are the core problems.What I'm looking for is suggestions to either reduce those issues, eliminate them, or encourage pk in other ways.  Any ideas are helpful,I'm not looking for 'pk sucks oh well' or so-and-so is a flap bastard,I'm looking for well, how about we have this.... or could we do this...Some of my own thoughts:Shards will revitalize pk at least initially - they will hit the mud     with a vengeance, and give others someone to kill, and reason to.We need some pk-required-to-enter areas and pker-only gear.We need a rewards system for pkers (something I hope to help with the     pk tracker at some point).We need either lower risk (but still some risk) or greater rewards in     general for pk. More players - better noob retention/training, more stuff and reason     for current players, especially bigger ones to play more.     To attract and retain more players.More PK required guilds - shards, future assassins (former Deathmonger     assassins), possibly a good-aligned, physical guild to oppose     shards/ninja.Anyways, those are my thoughts on what the issues are, and ways to resolve them.  What we need is more complete ideas, hell, any ideas,and for those of you with wizards, hopefully a willingness to codesome things for it.  I know I at least was primarily playing here forpk...and I know others (particularly those with shards) did and do aswell, so let's figure out some things to increase it.  Verte will goalong with anything reasonable I imagine, and do what he can to helpand improve it - this is coming from him btw.  I'm looking for player and wizard contributions, either/or, I just want to do what I can to improve things, so even if it's dumb lemmeknow it :)**linus**Subj: LaptopCc: (To: earwax) dakeyras,forbin,mosobp,humble,pestilence,fred,mizan,jareel,coldwind,pike,cerberus,subotai,cooper,hoyle,sundin,greymir,symbio,fakir,snakespear,zeus,mode,wocket,jaraxle,vital,ravennight,blade,tony,usagi,psychax,entreriDate: Jun 16 14:43FIX THE FUCKING LAPTOP!!!!!!!Nothing is more frustrating than to see all these candy asses get uber high levels just so they can't be seen by the laptop.  This enables them to have a huge advantage if they choose to pk...being able to hunt invis players lower than them, and if they choose not to, gives them free run of any pk areas with little to no risk of being seen there.Go back to having to letting it see all levels, and have it run on batteries that cost $$ and run out over time.This will at least put most everyone on a more level playing field.  Cash is so easy to come by anymore, it's not like buying batteries will be a pain in the ass.This could also prevent people from waiting until they're +75 to finally set pk.Other than that, we just need more incentive...some it's just the adrenaline rush/ego stroke that works, but to actually pull people that normally wouldn't pk in, there's gotta be less risk, more reward.Maybe less of a death penalty...1/8 xp instead of 1/3?  Also maybe a no loot thing.  This way there's no fear of losing that Gordie stick that you had to suck off a +100 for or whatever.  Most of the pkers give shit back anyway, unless the victim is a whiny little bitch or just a plain asshole, but if there's a definate no loot thing, maybe people will be more likely to try.Ok..this would lead to a "Why the fuck should I pk if I don't get anything for it?"Good question.  How about a reward system based on pk points.  Both the MK-Scar and PK-trakker assign points for various pks.  Now say I had 250 pk points.  I could go to the uber-bsness-pk shop and lay down those points to buy some kickass pk only weapon and/or armor.  With less to lose being pked, and some nice rewards for the successful pkers, maybe more people will sign on.Just some thoughts, and sorry if it's all jumble-fucked to read.Linus**psychax**Subj: pk stuffCc: (To: linus) earwax,dakeyras,forbin,mosobp,humble,pestilence,fred,mizan,jareel,coldwind,pike,cerberus,subotai,cooper,hoyle,sundin,greymir,symbio,fakir,snakespear,zeus,mode,wocket,jaraxle,vital,ravennight,blade,tony,usagi,psychax,entreriDate: Jun 20 00:52Cut out the pk cheats.  ie disconnecting.  You set pk or go into a pk area andyou lose connection expect to die for it if you get caught.  Nothing was gayerthan finally running down a wizard alt and them pussying out by disconnecting.In the idea of the pk areas....have rooms with random directions.  Thinkmaledicta's mystic caves.  But the directions randomize so its harder to run. IE: Room has 4 directions N,S,E,W.  Here's my idea leave the same directions butcolor them.  South is always blue, red is north, etc.  So the exit is 2 southfrom your current position.  East is blue, N green, S red, W yellow.  So type Ebecause its blue = a south direction.Get the idea?Make it so command stacking your way through an area doesnt work.  Its all funand games to be able to run to pesty's shake shop in one second.  Yet as a pkerkeeping track of pker's coming for you lame that in under 2 seconds someone canbe in the same room as you.Pauses.  Takes 2 hb for doors to open.  Takes a hb for the key code to be putin, then accepted. Gotta wait 5 seconds for the random herd of cows to stopblocking the road.Eliminate pk gangbangs.  You can only be attacked by 2 at a time unless those 2ppl dont = your player levels. ie One 19+100 player vs 5 lvl 19's5 vs 1 still a gang bang but you get an idea of what i'm talking about.PK body guards.  XP them up like a wocket pet.  Useable in pk like a Neo's pet.For those of you without the neo pets. (heh)  Pet couldn't be hit unless it wasduring a round it attacked.  Area effect spells not sure on.  Pet couldn't beattacked.  BTW Neo's pet wasn't pk.Psychax**psychax**Subj: pk part 2Cc: (To: linus) earwax,dakeyras,forbin,mosobp,humble,pestilence,fred,mizan,jareel,coldwind,pike,cerberus,subotai,cooper,hoyle,sundin,greymir,symbio,fakir,snakespear,zeus,mode,wocket,jaraxle,vital,ravennight,blade,tony,usagi,psychax,entreriDate: Jun 20 00:54Use pk points for "buffs". 10 points for added hp regen for an hour.  15 for spregen.  Added Stats for a period of time.Add another proc to weapons.  I decide to burn 20k coins and add a Directdamage fire proc to my trusty trident of war.  Sadly the proc only lasts for anhour but hey its added damage.Add stuff for non-equipment using guilds something to pk for.  Its all good tohave the newest and best armors/weps but without a current wizard continuelymaking changes to adjust for the new items that kinda guild just cant compete. But thats one of their disadvantages!  Bullshit.  I'll gladly keep dropping xpinto a guild to add armors (ala rangers)Less dependence on all the same weapons/armors.  Who doesn't use an elementalarmor, a gordie stick, skates, bracers of speed, etc.  I'd like to see armors geared/enchanted vs those specific items.  I got achainmail +3 vs gordie stick +2 vs tsunami +1 vs player spells.Make the enchantments not last.  Maybe since the item is magic vs a gordiestick it will negate all damage from a gordie stick for the round the armor"procs".THE ENDPSY**"
