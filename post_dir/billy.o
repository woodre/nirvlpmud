As a matter of fact, YOU were there when this whole discussion was brought to light.  Demonic and Sami said that guild members only need to follow their Directive, as it says in 'cyber influence'.  So I said, Hey, Cool, Great Idea.  It seems to me that you're butt hurt about something that I did to one of your other characters.  Especially considering I have -never- seen Billy login since I've been back.  You butt hurt about me partying up your Rogues?  You mad that I keep blicking them or something?   What's your deal?  The Cybers are actually PK'ing people now that I'm back.  You want to go back to the Polymorphing, Bard Loving, Sami Cybers? **"
