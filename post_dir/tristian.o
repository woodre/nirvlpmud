There will be plenty of time for questions of course. :^)  In addition to these classes, I am working on freeing up my schedule to work with those of you who would like to learn how to code or code better more individually.  I will try to mix in Nirvana-related examples in addition to the textbooks. Here is the link to the textbooks in case you wish to start reading ahead of time. :^)  http://www.mars.org/home/rob/docs/descartes-index.html **earwax**Subj: Armor shitCc: (To: zeus) wocket,feldegast,pain,jaraxle,eurale,beck,jenny,pestilence,puppy,wren,martha,gemini,angel,jamila,catt,star,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,mokri,sparrow,rumplemintz,aquila,lacar,quicksilver,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,catacomb,hair,veeshan,haywire,skie,sampson,y,chax,lisheDate: Mar 29 02:39I'd like you all to give me some feedback on this shit, just send me a reply to it....basically it involves a HUGE fundamental change to the mud, but one long overdue, i (and many players and wizzes) feel.  Basically, instead of all guilds, all players, using same gear  essentially, and everything being max ac, weight 1, with specials,  this will create a lot of diversity, especially considering that the guilds can be made to utilize the changes very easily.  The file to look at is /open/earwax/armor.txt  Just send a reply, not reply all, or post, I'll be sharing all feedback with the other admins and whatnot.  This is a major deal, so please send your feedback.  -earwax **star**Subj: areaDate: Jul 22 19:51All right..  most ya got..  some ya missed..  and you created a few new errors when ya made some changes..  some of the rooms are still ok, but some have started giving me an indexing on illegal type error.

I have noticed this in more than one room in different locations and the very next time it, after i update it, it will load just fine.  i am clueless as to what the problem could be. thanks Trist. **earwax**Subj: clubfedmobs.cDate: Aug 25 11:46put a logging statement in there, keep an eye on /log/tristian.mobs we'll see what happens . x **earwax**Subj: ldmudCc: (To: forbin) francesco,fakir,pavlik,stardream,jenny,pain,zeus,wocket,feldegast,vital,jaraxle,eurale,khrell,pestilence,puppy,star,wren,angel,martha,gemini,jamila,catt,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,aquila,kain,lacar,brittany,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,airwoman,catacomb,veeshan,haji,hair,skie,chip,sampson,chax,y,atipode,lisheDate: Oct  6 07:22I need to see work on this project.

If you wish to know what I am talking about, read some of the mails he has sent me.  Personally, I like the mud the way it is. I don't want to change it. I have no intention of dancing to some tune Earwax feels like playing on his flute. I do not, nor never have abused wizard powers. I occasionally snoop a player, but never when two players are in a room or chatting. And, I usually (almost always) tell a player if and when I am snooping them and also when I turn snoop off.  Its absurd that Earwax even brings that into a conversation about being a wizard.   Personally Boltar, I am sick and tired of his heavy handed way of dealing with things...and it's my opinion you are going to have a dead mud very soon because of it.  I will not tolerate someone who threatens, cajoles, and is otherwise a dick.   It is true I do not contribute to the mud much, other than the areas I did code and are in play.  However, I have never seen my contribution here to be one of code.  Wizards come and go...power hungry, unstable wizards have come and gone.  In almost every case where there has been an abuse of power, or a lack of good judgement, I have had a hand in resolving that issue...in some way or another.  And, I might add, you have usually backed me up in most of the disputes I have had some involvement in.  I don't really care what Earwax does. I do not have the juice, nor the time, nor really the interest anymore to try and corral his over-bloated ego...I suspect that issue, if its dealt with, will have to rest with you. apply sphere to being a wizard here...I've had a good run. I have enjoyed the game, and enjoyed for the most part the people I have met here.  If the current gestapo Earwax does indeed have his way and dewizes me, so be it.  Even though he feels otherwise, I still think I contribute something to the game...but as always, I will leave that up to you to decide. I am way too old and way to long in the tooth here to care much what some bully wizard dictates to me as being 'his way or the highway'.  Do you really want someone like this in charge of things to the point you give him THAT much authority?  Vert NEVER had an ego like Earwax. He NEVER abused any wizard power. He never, once he became a wizard, cheated the game. I cannot say the same for Earwax.  There is a WORLD of difference between Vertebraker and Earwax as far as Admin goes.  Personally, if Earwax is in charge, I don't want to be a wizard here. * **chip** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 04:07really? you don't snoop players chatting? then it's so funny how you knew the things my templar said to Earwax about a matter dealing with your templar who was on at the time, you drunk egotistical worthless fucking jackass.

I take responsibility for not being socially  good enough myself to keep a peace and get people to work good enough  together. but the fact remains that unless we complete some serious  rennovations the mud will just slide into obscurity.   Since there is no one else to do it. All conflicts between wizards  will be resolved by me. Odds are everyone involved will hate my solutions so I advise living and let live as much as possible and don't do things that you know are going to result in conflict or displine or even questionable if you're seen/caught doing them.   I need productive people right now, not squabbles. Everyone needs to add something positive. I can't have people that just exist to cause conflict because they find it entertaining to do so. I don't need people getting pissed off at every little thing. What the mud needs, what I need for the mud are productive people.  It's that simple. And before there is any more squabbling, ask yourself where you(individuals) are on that, and that is the squabbling going to  lead to anything positive or just piss people off so we get even more  short handed?   I'll leave it at that.   -Bp  **vertebraker**Subj: #includingDate: Jun  1 14:04When you #include a file, do this  #include "/players/tristian/def.h"  NOT  #include "/players/tristian/def.h";  note the semi-colon  it breaks thigns **worm**Subj: fuck thisCc: (To: vertebraker) fakir,boltar,mizan,mokri,katya,star,tristianDate: Jun  7 22:45third time in a row.. im RIPPED fuckin off out of an assload of shit.. i get no coins, no nothing. whatever you ppl changed is ruining everyones fun. good job. im going to be gone awhile.  this is total bullshit. later **tristian**Subj: bf gemsCc: (To: fred) tristianDate: Jul  5 09:45Fred, Fred, bah..zmud.

I feel that rather than reopen old guilds, or open new guilds, that touching up current guilds, adding new things to them would catch the attention of ppl we already have back playing. It would be awesome to assign wizards to each guild, trying to update them in anyway we can. That would build intrest in playing/killing more.. at the  same time, ppl would be out leveling more, helping lower levels etc. Just bringing a fresh feel back to the game. Artos feels having a PK Tourny once in awhile would help. He pointed out attracting pkers, ppl who like to chat a lot over public channels would also help gain intrest for players in the game, attracting old/new players etc. Honestly, I think the MUD has already taken a breath of fresh air and is on a nice roll. I'm just hoping we can all pitch in, in any way we can to help it keep on rolling. So, even though i'm just a player, I figured i'd start pestering you guys with ideas.. some i'm sure you'll blow off, others I hope you'll consider. Although, once again, i'd like to point out one thing.. I know rules are in place and need to be followed, but I think warnings should be given. Like a strike 1,2,3 and you're jailed.. rather than just jailing and banning.  To tell you the truth, losing just one player could lead to possibly losing his friends. While we're trying to revive this place, I think every player counts. I know Bolts ends up at the end of all the drama, so I think the wizards should handle most things themselves, without jailing when possible. I'm just hoping we can find a way to keep it fun for everyone involved.  Anyway, thanks for your time.. if you've read this far. ;)  -me *8 oopsee **tristian**Subj: roomCc: (To: worm) tristianDate: May  6 09:00I updated your room..i believe i moved the jump point to teh hotel 1 room north..make sure its where you want to be.

I don't really care about what he does or says, and I have encouraged other wizzes not to provoke him by even responding to anything he has to say. Yes. That is my official stance. Just flat out ignore him no matter how irritating his words may be. Don't bother him, don't help him, don't hinder him, just ignore him completely. But let him speak.  I know it sounds counter-intuitive but I encourage you to do the same, and even spread the word about it to others if possible. Delorean may be a griefer and a selfish little twit, but he has a right to login to this game and play.  In the past I have not been as saintly and approachable either, and I recognize that. In the past I have done things like delete his characters or siteban him and it has not changed his behavior. When I returned to here a few months ago,  I made an offer to start off with him on a clean slate. I believe I have held my end of the bargain. However he has chosen not to. But I'm cool with that.  Rather than wipe him off the MUD i chose a different vent for dealing with him. I made a comic which features some of his antics, of which there are two episodes so far visible at:  http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/a-barycentric-griefing-motion/ and http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/the-third-fastest-thing-in-the-world/  Again, I encourage others to simply ignore him, and let peace and contentedness be in your soul rather than pure rage that (insertDeityHere) has forsaken us and left us such a miserable little shitfucker to suffer with. Delorean and his kind are a vital part of this MUD's ecosystem, as we need diversity... strong PK'ers, roleplayers, socialites, coders, whining douchebags- We need them all.  There is a saying in Arabic which does not translate well, but I'll try- "I let my enemies dine at my doorstep because it is my pleasure, God willing." So paraphrased my take on that is: "I let Delorean play here and speak what he wants because it is my pleasure."  So you know what to do. The next stupid thing he does, mudmail me a transcript and I will credit you appropriately on my next comic strip(s).  Thank you for reading. -Miz **dragnar**Subj: LunchDate: Apr  3 09:22I'm in, planning on meeting you there... --Gnar aka John **tristian**Subj: LevelsCc: (To: fred) rumplemintz,tristianDate: Apr 11 15:38Hey.
