In any case, it's in /players/earwax/NRP_writeup.txt It's a fairly long file, so anyone that would rather read it in  email mail me your addy and I'll send it to you, or you can just ftp it from here.  This is a project that really needs additional ideas, at least for the rewards, and a great deal of code and tweaking to be done.  I'll welcome all help, but at least send me input on it.  -wax **"
