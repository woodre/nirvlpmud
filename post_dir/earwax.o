Don't worry about the lfuns, just kinda glance through stuff for a general idea.  Lfuns will be mud-specific.  It's just to give youkind of an idea of how things work.http://www.geocities.com/homemud/Textbooks-e.htmlThis is a link page that has all sorts of stuff on it.  Ihaven't looked at most of these, so I can't really recommend them, butthere's a lot of stuff here about LPC.http://www.sneakers.org/lpmud/www.neosoft.com/genesis/lpc_toc.htmlThis, as far as I'm concerned, is the king of them.  It' got a lot of stuff,however, that's not relevant here, anything to do with the 'function' class you can ignore, it won't work here.  Lfuns, like I said, are mud-specific.  This was written for Genesis MUD (the first LPMud ever), anda lot of it doesn't apply to other MUDs.  The important stuff however, is how to actually code, how to actually do things, etc.  This will helpyou a lot, I think.  It's well-written, and I think fairly easy to understandonce you have exposure to the basics.  Anyways, hope these help some.**chant**Subj: Bubbling potionDate: Dec 22 05:30Buy a bottle from the Shaman,goto the swamp from the bonfire its like e,e,ne squeeze crevices,e,enter,s you will see a blobKill the blobtaking the acid will blick you...so you need to bottle acid and get the ringtake the bottle back to the shamon and give it to the shamon, after like 5 minsthe shaman will give you the bottle, use is uncork bottle, gulp potion.has 3 uses, I believe its only obtainable once per boot.tho I may be wrong on that.*8**vital**Subj: getting started... hehCc: (To: humble) vital,earwax,fredDate: Jan  1 10:17Humble, I have a couple of links for you to check out and some files that might help you get started. This is all probably overwhelming and you will probably spend a couple hours just reading to get a feel for what you need or want to do.http://mud.bensin.org/tools/lpc/html/lpc.htmlThis is a pretty good place to get a good idea from.http://autos.cs.tu-berlin.de/tubmud/driver-0511/node18.htmlThis is bit out of date and for a different style of mud,but it still has some good points.http://www.sneakers.org/lpmud/www.neosoft.com/genesis/lpc_toc.htmlThis is probably the most in depth look at LPC and coding forit in general. Always a good reference, even after you have thebasics mastered. [ha ha ha]Also, feel free to browse through and look at all of the documentsin my /open/vital folder. They are there to help people. There arebasic examples in /open/vital/obj and /open/vital/npc and also in/open/vital/room. There are some documents that I'm working on inthe /open/vital/doc directory to help people with coding. It's notfinished, but they are also good points to start with in regardsto learning code. I would especially encourage you to look at thedocument about style /open/vital/doc/02_style.txt as it has somevery fundamental things that will affect the way you code for therest of your life [scary huh?].Sorry this is so long.

Some could supply AC, where thematic; case-by-case basis.  Medium would be for thief/finess fighter types.  This would be the type of   armor most beneficial for the future dodge/parry skills.  Heavy would of course be actual armor.  Platemail, chainmail, etc would fall   into this category.  AC should definitely reflect weight.  Physical Protection  Slot     Types                        AC (L/M/H)    Weight (L/M/H) Head:    Hats/Headbands/Masks/Helms    0  /1-2/2      1  /1-2/2+ Neck:    Leather Collar/Gorget         ---/1  /2      ---/1  /1-2 Body:    Body Armor                    1-2/2-3/4-6    1-2/2-3/4+ Arms:    Bracelet/Armbands/Bracers     0  /1-2/2      1  /1-2/2+ Legs:    Pants/Leggings                0  /1-2/2      1  /1-2/2+ Hands:   Gloves/Gauntlets              0  /1-2/2      1  /1-2/2+ Feet:    Shoes/Boots                   0  /1-2/2      1  /1-2/2+ Shield:  Buckler/Medium/Heavy/Tower    ---/1-2/3-4    ---/1-2/2+ Cloak:   Would have to be thematic, but maybe AC 1-2 for heavy cloak type  Magical Gear/Accessories Necklace/Amulet (Neck class, since otherwise it'd be collar/gorget) Rings (2)       (Disallow rings if gauntlets/gloves used?) Earring?        (Disallow if helms are used?) Belt            (Come on, these aren't physical protection) Misc/I guess Teddy could go here, compete with other miscs  I'd also like to see multiple slots be added in, could be fairly easily  implemented, I'll prolly slap a code snippet for it together.  Basically it'd be similar to multiple properties in rooms.  This would be very easy to do, really.  Switching stuff to these standards based on their current weight/ac values would be very easy as well.  If they are ac 2, their weight will be 2.  New stuff will use the new functions, if it uses the old funs  then it automatically gets adjusted on load.  I really don't wanna explain further, but it'd still require a lot of adjusting by hand.  Anyways, let me know what you guys think.  This is far from an end product, but it's somewhere to start, and I think it's pretty much what we should go with in the end.  Between us we should be able to hash out a pretty good system.  -Earwaximus **vertebraker**Subj: alignment from khrellDate: Nov  1 15:55[invis] Khrell intones: Well I wonder why there are items that keep players alignments evil, yet nothing for good guilds, yet a drawback of being a shardak/ Dark Order is the alignment, yet there are craptastic items that make it so they  never have to watch alignments.  Rather defeats the purpse of having alignment  restrictions for them.  [invis] Khrell intones: Templars kill one good mob and their guidl alignment die s and they can't use spells as well etc.  [invis] Khrell intones: not too mention if they use an item that lowers alig nment it has the same effect on said spells.  [invis] Khrell intones: well off the top of the head, Snows death plate, forbins  juju trinket. [invis] Khrell intones: shards and DO are favoring the juju trinket lately as  it frees up the armor slot for better armors. [invis] Khrell intones: not many necklace slots, so they use t hat to keep align evil    I know we will eventually change how alignment works. Want to look into this in the short term?    **vital**Subj: not sure if you care...Cc: wooDate: Nov 21 12:48but thought you might like this... it provides a cross platform development environment... http://www.eclipse.org/ --little v. **fakir**Subj: vampiresCc: (To: vertebraker) earwax,fredDate: Mar 24 13:09Ok...some things I am thinking...NO armors...we need to think of something for them to do with the armors they get...but they wear NO armor. I have never seen a vampire yet that had armor on. Perhaps they can use the armor they gain from battle to 'charge' an armor special. The more armor they put in...the better protected they are.  Weapons are ok...though again, I've never seen a vampire with a 'mace'. So maybe a limit on the weps...as to kind.  Or again, we could have them fight hands only...and hands would be set  according to a number of (weps points) they have in a donation type deal.  Not sure there. Maybe a combo of both. I like the idea of a vampire taking on other forms...(wolf) and (wraith)... but think these 'forms' should perhaps mutate their abilities... And lastly from this session of brainstorming...I'd like to see 'vampire speed' or something like that back in the guild...either as a permanent skill level, or as a limited time ability based upon, again, a stored amount of 'energy'. These are some prelim ideas....you guys let me know what you think... I don't see a reason to be hasty...if I work on this, it may be a  six month project. Long as its good when we are done. **legacy**Subj: Mage spells power evaluation.Cc: fred, pestilence, jareelDate: Aug 21 14:13POWER: Power can be gauged in two categories.  COINING:  This guild can make coind when it kills, However the yield for an 80k rack is COINING:  15-20k killing 5-6k coin mobs.  This is a huge drawback as you COINING:  really need a lot of coins to speed xp or use the power you  COINING:  have withing the guild.  DAMAGE:   This guild dishes out some major damage, is the amount legal? DAMAGE:   By normal standards I do not think so.  However when you  DAMAGE:   put the amount of damage you receive and how you need to DAMAGE:   kill I think this is viable.  The only place it is really  DAMAGE:   over powered is when you are in a party, maybe make a  DAMAGE:   mage party object and only let Magi Party together. DAMAGE:   I am not really sure if this is a huge problem, but it DAMAGE:   seems like it may need to be addressed.    The second part is spells The only spell I feel that is way over powered is the Detox spell. Magic Missile and Ctouch - You are looking at the two main attack spells and  Ctouch is far better, this maybe due to the damage type, I am not sure.  Ideas how to make the guild more viable to open up sooner rather than later.  Triple the xp cost of the guild to max. Tweek some spells, raise the effectiveness of Mssle and nerf the effectiveness of ctouch a midground is probably the right call. Nerf detox, the other spells that need adjustment will take awhile to fix. I am not sure if anyone will want to spend the amount of time on the spells right now.  Component costs:  We need a Wizard Belt or a Wizard pouch to hold components.  Every spell              should have some component.  necromancy could even have a spell that holds corpse dust to use for ctouch.  Or a spell that hold spirit energy for a mssle mold..will make corpse spells a lot more valuable, also will make mage power leveling a lot slower. **sparrow** Re:   final noteDate: Oct  3 19:53Man, I get a kick outta you.

I am thrilled at her willingness to help, yet I'm not sure if she has a learning disability or if she just wants someone to do her work for her. I spent an hour with her trying to get it through her head that she needed to remove the semi-colon from the end of the #include. I told her 11 times yes, 11.  She finially got it, moved on to the next file and it was the same error. Semi-colon at the end of an #include. I  explained it to her again. She said that she was frustrated and needed a break, and then proceded to log in tombsurfer. I am fairly patient, but I feel that this will take a lot longer to accomplish if she is helping.  I fear that people will be pulled away from their own work to try to help her with what she is  working on.  I like lacar, she has definately earned her spot as a wizard, and is very helpful as a player. Yet I do not think that she is cut out for area building.  Either we need to find a new role for her that fits, or I need to take a little bit of time and create a simple web app that allows her to fill in the blanks while it writes the "code" for her.  I have spoken with star about lacar, hoping to prove my gut instinct wrong. What I have learned from Star is that she and Angel have to basically write everything for her because if they tell her to fix something, she gets angry with them.  I won't put up with any attitude from her. I guess what it boils down to is that I do not want her as a converter. I think things would go a lot more smoothly if we let her continue working on her own stuff.  It terrifies me that she has write access to live game content. I did make a backup of dreamspeakr's files  before I gave her access. She could not grasp the concept of cp so I had to copy all of the files to her home directory for her. Once again I am not sure if this is a lack of learning ability or if she knows that if she plays dumb long enough, someone will do it for her. I have already showed her that I am not going to edit the files for her. I will show her where her errors are though.  When she realized this, she was frustrated and logged in tombsurfer. **sleepwalker**Subj: Source ControlCc: sleepwalkerDate: Dec 24 02:20Earwax,  Source control is something that professional software companies use to protect their code so that when changes go poorly, the code can be instantly reverted back to a previous version that worked.   An additional advantage is that the casual browsing developer can see what the old code did and how it did it. So if you added to the poly's another developer could go in and see how Mizan did things before that.   From your comments there seems to be some sort of ownership  issue with browsing different areas of the source. If that is the case then source control would be something to consider carefully or alternately one could consider what the basis is for certain areas of source code being private. If there are good reasons  (which is entirely possible), private areas can be made browsable by only certain developers.   In the end Nirvana is what is important, and as we know, Nirvana is code. To protect that code I advocate the MUD use source control. If you need pointers on how to do that cheaply  and easily let me know and I can send you pointers.   Happy to help,   theSLEEP **vertebraker**Subj: there are huge problemsDate: Jun 10 23:04there are huge problems with people using  #include "/blah.h";  instead of #include "blah.h"  I wish there was an option to allow this... aRGH!!!!!!!!!  and i mean having the semi-colon... heh **mizan** Re:   a vehicle for reward pointsCc: mizanDate: Jul 25 20:38I would love to do this, preferably once we are on a faster server- I have noticed the vehicles lag the mud hard once they are initially cloned and perhaps are even more wasteful than the monsters' guild in terms of resources.

Take a look at this traceroute coming from the server itself: traceroute to 89.1.197.64 (89.1.197.64), 30 hops max, 38 byte packets  1  206.71.152.209 (206.71.152.209)  0.930 ms  0.748 ms  0.753 ms  2  206.71.144.173 (206.71.144.173)  1.098 ms  1.003 ms  0.905 ms  3  206.71.144.170 (206.71.144.170)  0.505 ms  0.743 ms  0.733 ms  4  206.71.144.177 (206.71.144.177)  1.797 ms  1.593 ms  1.573 ms  5  207.136.177.241 (207.136.177.241)  1.486 ms  1.669 ms  1.614 ms  6  te1-2-10G.ar4.NYC1.gblx.net (67.17.75.102)  1.694 ms  1.784 ms  2.454 ms  7  telia-1.ar4.NYC1.gblx.net (64.208.110.114)  2.265 ms  2.077 ms  2.269 ms  8  barak-01814-nyk-b2.c.telia.net (213.248.83.2)  1.859 ms  1.939 ms  1.860 ms  9  * *Icmp checksum is wrong  po1-3.bk3-bb.013bk.net (212.150.232.214)  395.192 ms 10  * * * Icmp checksum is wrong 11  gi1-3.bk1-gw.013bk.net (212.29.206.198)  322.903 ms Icmp checksum is wrong   275.402 ms * 12  * gi12-1.bk1-acc4.013bk.net (62.90.133.130)  318.546 ms * 13  * * * 14  * * * 15 (et.al) till timeout  Note that the two hops at the 013 border router po1-3.bk3-bb.013bk.net are messed up. I believe this is in Tel Aviv, where the handoff to Telia/Global Crossing is made. So the problem seems to be centered there, and it may be a deliberate strategy where outbound traffic is scrubbed a little bit, to prevent network attacks into the zone where Israeli citizens would be affected.  ICMP checksum errors indicate some sort of packet loss that is inherently beyond the control of Nirvana's network, and thusly we really can't be held accountable for it.  All of the access times from hop 1 to hop 8 are fairly fast, and well under the 5ms average. 206.71.144.170 is a transit for an OC192 connection, running at a full 8Gbit.  Just letting you know. -miz **mizan**Subj: Netvision AcquisitionCc: (To: hercules) mizan,boltar,earwaxDate: Aug 23 16:29I just spoke to my cousin (who is in Bersheba) and she confirmed some of the problems that are in play. Apparently Netvision acquired 013/Barak recently. Bittorrent traffic seems to be dropping pretty badly, and Skype no longer seems to have proper QOS so packets drop, although when she turns up the bitrate things improve.  You should check the news on your side. Apparently the Netvision acquisition of 013/Barak is really fucking up their infrastructure. A lot of people are complaining, and it really isnt anything that we can do unfortunately. So i take back my assessment that there is some inherent security in misreporting ICMP ping traffic. It seems like all hell is going on for people who were former 013/Barak subscribers.  -miz **forbin**Subj: HeyDate: Aug 24 20:18Hey bud, guess who is around.

I have no clue what the issue is and I am unable to view anything that might be the cause of it.   So.. anyways.. a few times Bahamut has logged out he has logged in with a crap load of stuff on him that is not his along with 200k coins. Each time it has happened I have been on, he had only disconnected once when this has happened, the other times he had quit out properly. He has always given me the items and the extra coins, but he is getting tired of the issue..  I had spoken to Mizan about it but he was unsure of what the problem might have been, so i am mailing you since I forgot to mention it last night  Ok, well, I am not really sure what else.. I hope you have a good day!  *hugs*  Katya **boltar**Subj: pesty and general politicsCc: mizanDate: Aug 28 22:44  I have decided to accept mizan's plan with regards to pesty. Pesty will be no higher than level 30, and generally on probation.   Now the general politics part... I really think that politics wise it  would be best if you see something to just refer it to miz or me. I know  you've told me you hate dealing with it and aren't good with it. I think that we can get a lot of rough edges off with regard to how players and lower  level wizards see things if we discuss it amungst ourselves before action is taken. Most stuff can wait for discussion, of course if someone is  intentionally crashing the mud or something it has to be dealt with on the spot, I am just talking about most things.   If we handle things smoother or at least make it look that way, it will be better for attracting and keeping players.   I think this goes right along with what you told me you wanted, just to  hand things off to miz on the politics side. Just do it from the begining and not take action immediately. That way we get the full benefit of things  being smooth. We can discuss at length amungst ourselves if the situation calls for it.   Sound good?   -Bp **vertebraker** Re:   katyaDate: Aug 29 10:05ok **vertebraker**Subj: yeahDate: Aug 29 23:20I think you're going over the top. **boltar**Subj: people management. Cc: mizanDate: Aug 30 22:10   I've learned of some things you've been doing to try to get people to be productive. I know you don't mean it to come off the way it does, but  hell even I can't help but feel insulted without thinking it through  deeper.   A mud cannot be run as business, it cannot be run like a military unit.  While I can't say I run a mud perfectly, hell maybe not even well, I know that people won't do what they don't want to do. they just quit and go  away.  Basically what I like to do is controlled chaos. Let the people  do what they want and concentrate on keeping things from getting too  far out of control.   Dealing with mud wizards is like herding cats. You've got to get the cats to herd themselves. They won't respond to saying they haven't been  productive, they won't respond well to saying what they want to do is  worthless.   They won't do things they've been asigned very well. They will at least try  to do things they pick to do.   I think that the issues regarding wizard tasks and productivity have to go through someone such as myself or maybe fred and/or miz.    It just takes a finer admin touch that develops over time, it's just not  like the rest of the world. People can't turn off their job but they can turn off their computer. If this world causes stress for them, they turn  it off.   I know it's hard to achieve specific goals that way, but that's just the way it is. It's  something i've learned over the years. Hell even bribing a wizard with  levels or wizardship to do something doesn't work that well.   just let me handle it if a wizard isn't being productive with regards to doing what they said they would do. assignments have to be done with  a lot of flexibility.   **vertebraker**Subj: HeyDate: Oct  4 09:48Hey, send me a mail and let me know how everything is going. I noticed you logged in yesterday.

It will say something like... 'you are too busy casting spells'. Only after a round of combat has passed will you be able to leave the room, or disingage from combat.

I was also thinking it would be cool as hell to have a guild level 9.  This guild level gives you the level of 666 on all who screens, as well as some sort of additional attack or special.  One idea i had was to be able to take the shape of shardakbion during battle, or be able to transform for a period of time.  This would lend super strength and higher WC.  Otherwise I had the idea that we could summon a shadow, shardak's shadow, kind of like an extra pet, it lends attacks and AC bonuses.  Just a thought, but I really think the 666 lvl is cool as hell.  Could make glvl 9 worth like 30 million or something outrageous.  Hell, I'd do it!! Just some ideas.   BTW...I would like to see more themed weapons and armors.  I hate the fact that everyone is using the same eq all the time.  I am willing to help if there is anything I can do.
