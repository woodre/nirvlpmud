It will write to the /log directory and append to the file. Example: log_file("ADVANCE", ctime() + " " +cap_name+" advanced to level "+level+" ") This will write to /log/ADVANCE --John **vertebraker**Subj: Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: dragnar) darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Sep 27 22:27Guys,  I think it would be a good idea to remove sponsorship requirements from guilds.  For example, mages, samurai, shardak, etc.  Since the player pool is so small, I feel there is no point in having the requirement of waiting for someone else to login in order to enjoy 25% of the content of the MUD.  Any objections?   **oberon** Re:   Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: vertebraker) dragnar,darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Sep 29 19:01I think sponsorships are an interesting aspect.. I'm not sure if I like seeing it deleted all together. So, as an idea, what if we keep sponsorship alive on those guilds but add a mob that will sponsor somebody for 80k coins. Now you have a way for people to buy it, or do it for free if a player is on.  - Oberon **rumplemintz** Re:   Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: vertebraker,dragnar,darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Oct  7 14:01I like the idea of the coin cost, as it's insanely easy to coin up these days anyway.  I do agree that it should be changed. **dragnar**Subj: Always test with a test charCc: darkfireDate: Oct 11 08:44I fixed the login/logout messages for mages for when players have %NAME% in the login/logout commands this morning. When I first logged in to test it I logged in as DB. The guild_login function is called from player.c, and it is called before gear is restored. So guild_login failed and DB lost all of his gear lol. Always test with a test character :) **dragnar**Subj: Samurai headsCc: darkfireDate: Oct 13 23:49I added a head_count to the sam guild object. Spikes no longer save. If someone has a spike saved, the first time they spike with it it should add to the guild amount.  Please try it out and let me know how it works. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: room.c Cc: (To: fred) rumplemintz,shinshi,sami,vertebraker,oberon,darkfire,mosobpDate: Oct 18 21:59I always liked the way some rooms that had call_outs in them shut them off when no players were in the room. I finally got around to adding the functionality to room.c.  You can use the new: set_call_out( string co, int interval, int rand_interval )  to set the name of the call_out function, the interval and random interval. . In the inherited room you do set_call_out in the reset, then define the function that will be the target of the call_out. I'll put an example in /doc/build/room/call_outs. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: locker exampleCc: darudeDate: Oct 20 12:02soulbindmob.c - Mob that drops the weapon, sets the binder when it dies soulbind.c     - Weapon that tracks the soulbind, plus some specials I tested it and saved it in casino and it worked. I did not try a save with my testchar by doing a quit but it should work... --John **"
