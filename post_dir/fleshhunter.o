And hope you read it completely.  Mark, you and I have known each other for several years. During that time I have watched you go from being this shy boy to this wonderful young man. You have grown up. You have learned alot and been through things for the first time. And come out ahead. You have been an amazing friend to me. When there was no one else I could completely open up to, there was you. And you were always there.   I made alot of mistakes in my life. Right now the one I regret the most was lying to you. It started as a joke with someone else on here. And then turned to lots on here, including you. Wasnt my idea initially, but once it started and you were so into being my friend, I didnt know how to say no, it wasnt true. I enjoyed the attention.. I enjoyed the friendship. I wish I could turn the clock back and do things differently, more than you could ever imagine. But i cant. I just have to go from this point forward.  The things you learned about me.. were really truly me. The pictures may not have been real, but the emotions and the things you know about me.. are real. I'm the same person you always knew me as.. just in a different body. My heart is the same. And it probably makes no sense to you nor do you care right now, but I need you to know these things.  As stupid as it sounds, I consider you to be one of my very closest friends. And I miss that. And I would do anything to have it back. Please. Just think about it. Please give me the chance to show you who I really am. To make up for the hurt I caused you. It would mean the world to me.  Love, Lyn **salina**Subj: I know.Date: May 19 21:54I know I hurt you. And Rob and even Roy could tell you that is all that mattered to me was how I was going to hurt you. But you needed to know. And you needed me to admit it. I'm sorry and if I could take it back, believe me I would change everything. But I cant Mark. All I can do is hope that you will eventually forgive me. But I wont pressure you for that because honestly, I could understand if you never did. But please know that I am so very sorry. And that I wish I could take it all back and make it all right. And I would give anything to be able to do that. **fleshhunter**Subj: HeyCc: (To: ice) fleshhunterDate: Jun 12 09:18Ok well last night, something else went on... I was getting ready to go to sleep and people downstairs were banging really loudly and we had to deal with this before except this time it was 11pm at night... Any ways, so I start stomping on the floor to shut them up AFTER Ross took a hammer to the floor... And I came out and Mom started to tell me that I didn't need to do that and Ross was like YOU DON'T DO THAT! I'VE DEALT WITH IT, OK! And I was like WELL EXCUSE ME and he kept talking and quitely I said Shut Up He said YOU DON'T TELL ME TO SHUT UP! Then I went into my room and went to bed. This morning I woke up and Mom said, "Mark, since we have no way of getting Ross because of financial reasons, I'm going to let you move to Rob's if it's ok with him." So it's up to you bro. You and Kerrii take as long as you need to decide. Hopefully I'll talk to you later. Peace **fleshhunter**Subj: RakionDate: Jun 29 16:36Rakion      2300    2399    Both   and   192.168.1.101 **chip**Subj: Attn: Hdg muddersCc: (To: blizzard) chip,crip,ice,yoshimitsu,demonic,darkfyre,nytewhisp,damion,bardock,vahiti,lloyd,southstar,valerie,devi,virus,viper,fleshhunter,krillgeta,gogeta,shadowman,cloud,seifer,ritcher,justin,james,jaz,jackDate: Oct 20 17:21As you guys know, as this character or Sephiroth, I'm an HdG mudder as well, born and raised. My first area I'm going to make will be the town of Havre de Grace, including the heights, state park, schools (minus bakerfield), most of rt 40, the downtown area and the waterside. I'd like to get ideas and input from all of you who would be interested in bringing our beloved HdG onto Nirvana and make it the best area it can possibly be. I've got a majority of it mapped out on paper as a reference for directions and order of streets and businesses. But there's still alot to do as far as detail and setting it up to be coded. All ideas and suggestions will be taken into serious consideration, and many I'm pretty sure will get used. For all those who actively participate in this hometown pride even as I like to call it, I'll have a plaque or something of the sort set up in one of the main areas of it with the names listed of all those who help bring it together. I want it to be the best it can be, as I'm sure all of you do too. Mail me anything you think of, or email it to me at nyteshade187@hotmail.com / message it to me at http://www.myspace.com/lostminddeusesmuerte, or IM me at knockmyselfout82. And as I will be taking this project very seriously, only serious suggestions will be considered. Hope to hear things back from you guys (and girl lol). Best wishes. **hercules**Subj: death ?Date: Jul 31 18:28Hi, It seems no one i could find now could explain why a high lvl samurai and high lvl ranger kicked ur guts... was there a reason ? thanks, Hercules the green ranger **"
