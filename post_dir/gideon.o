If someone is coming into that room from the other direction, they haven't just entered a building.  I did not intend to favor anyone, and had I noticed that I would have asked him to change it.  I'll admit to letting a few "you"s slide cos my opinion at the time was that if someone is standing on a road, "You are standing on a road" is true, not an assumption.  I have since been told by people bigger than me to not even allow that.  I did not require him to change his area after I was told that, because I had already told him to put it in.  I told him that any future areas couldn't have the word "you" at all, and that if he wanted help re-doing the rooms in his preschool I would be happy to help him.  For the record, I would also be happy to help you with ideas on how to say what you want without using "you" or assuming anything about a player's reactions..  *8)  Star **star**Subj: Area stuffCc: wormDate: Sep  8 11:37The first "official" round of stuff to fix is all ready to go.  I have a feeling you won't like it at all, but it is what it is. There's a few more things I'll check into for you.  That stuff we talked about the other day..  but for now, what you need to get started is in /players/gideon/bootcamp/changes.txt  Any questions, lemme know..  *8)  -Star **mizan** Re:   FavorCc: mizanDate: Sep 10 21:54I haven't slept on this but I have tried to put some proper thought to it. The short answer is that I am not willing to give Jen another chance as a wizard right now. Perhaps later down the road, but not now.  I appreciate that you are willing to put yourself on the line for her, but I ask you one thing. What is SHE willing to put on the line for you? Would she be as willing to help you if your places were swapped?  Jen has really been nothing but trouble on here. You may feel that by asking other wizards around, that their response of 'sure, no problem' equates to outright or tacit support for her. I can tell you that the people I have spoken to hope that she does not return, and I can only speculate that some have basically passed the buck in anticipating me being the 'goalkeeper' and ultimately voting 'no'.  I tell you this not to be a dick, I am telling you this because I feel that other people don't want to hurt your feelings. They have their own reasons for saying whatever they said. You and I are just going to have to respect that. I have been asking other wizards for their opinions No offense, but I cannot really consider the opinions of Fred or X very highly on this. They are awesome people, but honestly those two guys are the most forgiving and knowingly do not have to deal with cleaning up any messes.  You may ask what Jen has done recently to warrant this continued mark against her- well, I'll tell you what I know verifiably.  - The note that Illarion posted in the green regarding misinformation   being spread about guild nerfings- This seemed to have been caused   almost entirely by outright fabrications she had spread to others.   This sort of bullshit is extremely damaging, not because we run a   corporation, or because we have trade secrets- but because it affects   the player base negatively. All of the hard work you have had in   trying to bring people back is directly threatened by her actions.   This to me is a very serious offense. She may counter otherwise, but her   mouth is a serious, serious liability to the MUD. End of story.  - It has come to my attention that the only thing Jen seems to enjoy   doing online is figuring out who other people's second characters   are. This is not the sort of behavior that inspires any faith for   those who are wizzes. I say this in the tone of wondering if you   would willingly hire a petty thief to work in your shop. I'm not   implying she is a thief of course, but implying the personality   conflicts. You know what i mean.  I might have missed other things, but this is what comes to mind in the short term. Now i'll make a subject change... continued in part 2... **"
