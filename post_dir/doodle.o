His player file looked hosed, so I looked at a backup from 2014 and that was also bad. I found one from 2012 and that one looked ok. Try to log him in, if the password is off let me know and I can clear it. If you are missing anything I can hook you up also. Good to see you back, --Gnar/John **"
