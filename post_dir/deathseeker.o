A monster so terrible two fighters could not defeat it. In a last ditch effort to defeat the monster Paragus and Piano fused together to form one being, Sami. Sami took more after Paragus' saiyan heritage but still displays some of the traits of Piano.   so that is what i got so far let me know what you think  **jinichi**Subj: dishonorCc: (To: recca) deathseekerDate: Sep  1 22:10i was in guild hall deathseeker was raiding it to get to me i was lagging hardcore i quit out/dced and gmud crashed at the same time on me i loged back in and what should have been a dishonor! symbio said no he wont dishonor me for the reason i was laging really really bad...... however being the rule says no quiting out in a pk fight i broke the rule and feel i should be dishonored even if it was beyond my control! I want to be held accountable to the laws that govern us and the guild and its officers i was in the wrong no matter if i could help it or not so i see no reason for the dishonor to be set aside! Jinichi Seeker of the way! **recca**Subj: Re: DishonorDate: Sep  2 15:14This was sent to Jinichi, meant to CC you since he mailed it to you also..  Jinichi,  At the end of the day, a Directive can interpret and forgive a broken law if the situiation deems it nessisary. I will leave it at that for this email, as there are non-cybers involved.  In the future, please leave non-cybers out of our guild issues. Thanks.  - Recca, Directive of CyberNetica **dreadbane**Subj: Looking for Illusion BracersCc: (To: cgi) symbio,deathseekerDate: Sep 25 11:00Anyone have the Illusion Bracers?? --DB **"
