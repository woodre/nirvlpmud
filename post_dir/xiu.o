Good to know you're still out there though.  I'm doing fine, been busy with work  and doing stuff with the family while it's still nice out.  Talk to you laters.  Fred **fred** Re:   YupDate: Oct 14 17:31Sure is.

I'll be around more after this, though I'm not sure it's quite through with me.  I still need to get Tyler a doctor appointment and get him to a neurologist about his migraines. I do plan to get my to-do list started within the next few days.  As soon as I feel a little better myself.. **dragnar**Subj: TourDate: Sep 11 13:54I put my notes in your /tour directory. Let me know what you think. --Gnar **"
