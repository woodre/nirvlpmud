For 1) I still do.  \n \nto save gear on players it can only be the most simple of gear and then it \nrequires some error trapping should a wiz make a typo or change the file  \nname. Otherwise we'll have pfiles asploding.  \n \n\n**\nrumplemintz\n**\n Re:   Saving items on player\nCc: (To: boltar) dragnar,rumplemintz,fred,illarion\nDate: Oct  9 14:42\n\nAs for making sure pfiles do asplode, we might think about \nusing a different file for the equipment saves. \n \nThat way we can check that file and parse it (if it exists), and remove \nit if there's nothing to save, etc... \n \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\n Re:   Saving items on player\nCc: (To: rumplemintz) boltar,dragnar,rumplemintz,fred,illarion\nDate: Oct  9 14:47\n\nJust an FYI, items have been saving on players that disconnect for \na long time. Have we never run into an issue? \n \nLiterally, all we have to do not force the player to drop the objects \nwhen they quit and they will save with the current system already in place. \n \nObjects save in the treasure_str in the player .o file. \n--Gnar \n\n**\nboltar\n**\n Re:   Saving items on player\nCc: (To: dragnar) rumplemintz,boltar,dragnar,rumplemintz,fred,illarion\nDate: Oct  9 21:09\n\n \nI had forgotten about that. And I did put error trapping code in it \nnot to destroy the pfiles and it is only for simple stuff. \n \n\n**\nsin\n**\nSubj: clan spell\n\nDate: Oct 11 17:38\n\nq \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\n Re:   Beta Question\nCc: rumplemintz\nDate: Oct 16 22:59\n\nI have had to talk to Thomas before. However, I only care when it causes \npeople to get frustrated to the point where they are ready to stop playing. \nI stepped in at that point. A single random kill steal I don't think is \nthat big of a deal, we have evil guilds, we need to allow some playing the \npart. \n--Gnar \n\n**\nshinshi\n**\nSubj: Djinns\n\nDate: Oct 17 16:41\n\nYou said \"drop the ac down to like 10\" but it's already 10 =P \n\n**\nsid\n**\nSubj: BF Gems\n\nCc: l\nDate: Oct 19 10:10\n\nHey Fred, \nThere are several gems in the guild that are unfinished. One of which is the soul gem. \n \nPerhaps the soul gems could augment corpse usage, either healing when corpses are used or something like that. \n \nSince they are lvl 3 gems, perhaps they could also heal sp or something like that. \nSince they are lvl 3 gems, perhaps they could also heal sp or something like that. \n \n-Sid \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: Double XP\n\nDate: Oct 20 17:05\n\nSo, since we are having a double xp weekend, what should we do with \ndouble xp object? If a wizard casts it I'm pretty sure it would double \nthe xp again...Should we disable it for the weekend? \n--Gnar \n\n**\nshinshi\n**\nSubj: Pyroblast for Elementalists\n\nDate: Oct 22 19:51\n\nNeed you to check into it. The spell now costs 40. Damage does 105. \nI know there is NO way you're gonna allow that to be approved but \nI wanted to know what else I could really do for it? The casting time \nwas upped from 3 heartbeats to 6 heartbeats. I'm also probably \ngoing to increase the cooldown from 30 seconds to 2 minutes? Maybe more? \nThoughts? \n \n-Shinshi \n\n**\nbizkit\n**\nSubj: ferret remains\n\nDate: Oct 23 07:40\n\nthe log of it switch hitters is /players/pestilence/FERRETREMAINS.TXT \nhope it helps, thanks. \nBizkit \n\n**\npestilence\n**\nSubj: sp only heals\n\nDate: Oct 29 16:58\n\nMade some sp only heals \nhoping to compete with those of jareels sold \nby Corlando... \n/players/pestilence/amity/obj/fsmoothie.c and lfsmoothie.c \nthanks \nPesty \n\n**\npestilence\n**\nSubj: daycare\n\nCc: (To: boltar) dragnar,fred,rumplemintz\nDate: Oct 30 18:51\n\nThe daycare rooms are all full, there are lots of  \nkids that belong to wizes and have no father's or \nthe father char no longer exists,  Also there \nis atleast 1 char that hasn't logged in since 98, that has \naround 20 fatherless children in the daycare.  If shown \nhow I would gladly sort through and make room in \ndaycare rooms, or we can add another room.  Would \nlike your thoughts.

I would like to take away the day restriction or keep the day \nrestriction but keep the djinns at an overpowered rate :P \n \nThoughts? -Mark \n\n**\nshinshi\n**\nSubj: Djinns\n\nDate: Nov  7 17:49\n\nI still haven't heard back from you about the Djinns.

Seems \ncumbersome to swing swing swing throw idea.  500 dmg if dying seems alright \nbasically a weapon based fatal shot. 100 might be a little high I could see \ndoing 70ish range.  Not sure on the lore/background of the wep but for \nweight 4 I could see possibly going two_handed wield. on the shields I'm \nfine with resistances but 15 on each is way to high.  2's I'd be down with. \nFred * \n \nFred * \n\n**\nwicket\n**\nSubj: elementalists\n\nDate: Dec 10 16:09\n\nBeta has gone smooth looks like everything is good and we waiting approval \nto open.... ill be waiting to hear from you... thanks Wicket \n\n**\ndeathseeker\n**\nSubj: Ranger Guild Power Levels\n\nCc: **\nDate: Jan 21 20:45\n\nHey Fred, I have talked with a few fellow Power Rangers (those who have logged in) and a large majority of them had agree'd with this idea, and i was hoping to run it past you. If possible, I (we) would like the Power Level to go back to the Cap that it used to be, if not lower. I know this is a odd request, however, some of the newer Rangers do not understand the importance of donating, and Teamwork, and how this is 90% of our guild I feel that it would be good for us to re establish that teamwork that we stove so hard to achieve.

At tthat time you'll be reinstated \nwith no guild loss.  Until that time you can just save up experience. \n \nFred \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: Skan\n\nDate: Feb 20 19:33\n\nHey Fred, \nPuppy just returned to us. One of his alts was Skan, a Ranger. \nMosh remembers him.  Anyway he did not inactivate him so he got  \npurged. He is in the process of re-joining the guild. But since \nRangers has such a high requirement to max guild I'd thought I'd \nask if you would consider setting his guild abilities for him? \n \nYour call, just thought I would ask, thanks Fred \n--Gnar \n\n**\nmosh\n**\nSubj: skan\n\nDate: Feb 22 09:34\n\nhey i posted skan to globe but since we were unable to restore his player file did not think he should have to wait a week. however, i have not recruited until the week or i hear back from you it is ok  \nThanks \nMosh \n\n**\nshiro\n**\nSubj: sword i had made\n\nDate: Feb 22 23:00\n\nhey i had a custom made weapon by you that was stored in my room but sense \nmy room was now gone because of the new changes i no longer have it is \nthere anyway i can get it back it was the excalibur sword u made me `f \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: LD\n\nCc: (To: shinshi) rumplemintz,fred,star,pestilence\nDate: Feb 25 16:36\n\nWe did a lot of testing on LD today. If you see things \nin the logs that look illegal, such as giving players coins \netc. keep in mind the logs between LD/LP are shared. Check \nwith me before you punish someone.

These big parties are a big draw \nfor the players so I want to encourage it.
