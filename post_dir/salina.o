I am sorry to bother you with this but I am not sure who else I can talk to. I posted a note on Knights board, please read it if you can. We are having a lot of issues with the new Elite. From threatening to make someone a criminal because their alignment is off and repeatedly bugging them about it. To going around and accusing others of stealing corpses when they havent. Even accusing others in private tells to people. That isnt what being a Knight or Knight Elite is about in my opinion.   I will become more active and try to help the situation, but please let me know what I can do to help. I just am stuck. Marek doesnt listen, he has become the biggest ass on the game it seems and feels he does no wrong. But that isnt how I feel a Knight should be. He cant attack a player or his pet/spinal and then when they fight back, run to a hotel room and place them on criminal list. Please advise me on how to handle this Fred. I really am lost. Maybe I just am looking at it wrong and need to realize the rules arent as I think.  Thank you, Salina **teepo** Re:   hey youCc: (To: keli) salinaDate: Nov  4 03:55hey havent heard from you in a while just hoping everything is alright with you havent been able to get in contact wiht you and havent seen you on here or facebook in a while i will more than likely not be on tomorrow but will be on here for sure quite a bit on saturday morning and late saturday night so maybe youll get this before then and ill see ya i hope so i really do miss hearing ya  jas **"
