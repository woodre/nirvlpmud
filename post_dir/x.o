If you wish to know what I am talking about, read some of the mails he has sent me.  Personally, I like the mud the way it is. I don't want to change it. I have no intention of dancing to some tune Earwax feels like playing on his flute. I do not, nor never have abused wizard powers. I occasionally snoop a player, but never when two players are in a room or chatting. And, I usually (almost always) tell a player if and when I am snooping them and also when I turn snoop off.  Its absurd that Earwax even brings that into a conversation about being a wizard.   Personally Boltar, I am sick and tired of his heavy handed way of dealing with things...and it's my opinion you are going to have a dead mud very soon because of it.  I will not tolerate someone who threatens, cajoles, and is otherwise a dick.   It is true I do not contribute to the mud much, other than the areas I did code and are in play.  However, I have never seen my contribution here to be one of code.  Wizards come and go...power hungry, unstable wizards have come and gone.  In almost every case where there has been an abuse of power, or a lack of good judgement, I have had a hand in resolving that issue...in some way or another.  And, I might add, you have usually backed me up in most of the disputes I have had some involvement in.  I don't really care what Earwax does. I do not have the juice, nor the time, nor really the interest anymore to try and corral his over-bloated ego...I suspect that issue, if its dealt with, will have to rest with you. apply sphere to being a wizard here...I've had a good run. I have enjoyed the game, and enjoyed for the most part the people I have met here.  If the current gestapo Earwax does indeed have his way and dewizes me, so be it.  Even though he feels otherwise, I still think I contribute something to the game...but as always, I will leave that up to you to decide. I am way too old and way to long in the tooth here to care much what some bully wizard dictates to me as being 'his way or the highway'.  Do you really want someone like this in charge of things to the point you give him THAT much authority?  Vert NEVER had an ego like Earwax. He NEVER abused any wizard power. He never, once he became a wizard, cheated the game. I cannot say the same for Earwax.  There is a WORLD of difference between Vertebraker and Earwax as far as Admin goes.  Personally, if Earwax is in charge, I don't want to be a wizard here. * **fakir**Subj: email addyCc: **Date: Oct  7 20:11Hey...if it ends up I am not around here anymore...(always bucking the powers that be...thats me!)...my email is dandrebin@comcast.net  Still like to stay in touch once in a while.

I think wax's ideas are going to be a huge improvement for the mud and will bring a much larger Pbase. only people who may find him a dick are the abusers/grievers/cheaters. so which category shall you place yourself in? take a pick, heh. no one needs to hear your whining when you're never even around to give any of it solid structure. find something better to do than bitch about things you're not even getting yourself involved in. if you don't like how things are, don't bitch. change em. which means come here more regularly. i've not found thing one wrong with the projects Earwax has proposed and begun. and i'm quite sure in my own mind, being a long time player myself, that this mud needs an admin like Earwax to weed out the weak and the whining. and if you're so heartbroken that the  mud will be doing so well here in the very near future just because you won't be involved to get recognition for it, then maybe you should be dewizzed. i personally will not be expecting recognition, for i'm not able to be involved due to heavy hitting life circumstances. tho, I'm not bitching either, because the place i have called home for over 10 years will continue to be home and a nice one at that. i just wish we could get more wizzes like Wax, Verte, Bolts and Fred around here. and as soon as humanly possible, i'm hoping to learn tons from all 4, Wax especially. Chip - Apprentice Developer (learning) **fakir**Subj: bullshitCc: (To: earwax) boltar,fakir,xDate: Oct  8 10:52If my being a wizard here is somehow hindering your efforts to take over the mud, then by all means de-wiz me!  I know how difficult it can be to have your own way with these kids you insta-wiz (like chip) if someone else is around watching what you do, both as a wizard and as a player.  There were three (3) other wizards logged in who were well aware of your trigger cheat...but not one of them even paid attention nor had the  balls to call you on it.  Well, gosh, I wonder why. apply sphere to your ego, all one needs do is read the venom and self angrandization (not a real word, I know, but it describes what I see)alias to get a feel for what a king size ego you really have.  I am in awe of your greatness! As to what YOU do, as I said before, I don't give a SHIT. It  is what B does that will interest me.  If he allows you to  have complete and udder control of this mud, then so be it. If that is the case, I don't want to be a wizard here. I can  tolerate you being a wizard...but I could not tolerate you  being a wizard that has any fucking thing to do with me or what I do here.  In my opinion, you are sadly lacking in any kind of people skills, your ego IS far larger than any I  have encountered here, and your heavy handed, bullying style of management is going to drive ppl away from the mud rather than bring them in...regardless of what you do as a coder. Personally, I think the reason you want me gone is so you CAN do more as you wish, rather than as you should.  I'm about  the only one here who would actually call you on something. Bottom line, Earwax, is that you can rant and rave all you  want...its still Boltar who calls the shots here.  I'll  abide by whatever HE decides, not you.  And by the way, my  usage of the term 'udder' was not incorrect.  I think you are starting to feel like this mud is your own tit, to squeeze or manipulate however you wish.

I take responsibility for not being socially  good enough myself to keep a peace and get people to work good enough  together. but the fact remains that unless we complete some serious  rennovations the mud will just slide into obscurity.   Since there is no one else to do it. All conflicts between wizards  will be resolved by me. Odds are everyone involved will hate my solutions so I advise living and let live as much as possible and don't do things that you know are going to result in conflict or displine or even questionable if you're seen/caught doing them.   I need productive people right now, not squabbles. Everyone needs to add something positive. I can't have people that just exist to cause conflict because they find it entertaining to do so. I don't need people getting pissed off at every little thing. What the mud needs, what I need for the mud are productive people.  It's that simple. And before there is any more squabbling, ask yourself where you(individuals) are on that, and that is the squabbling going to  lead to anything positive or just piss people off so we get even more  short handed?   I'll leave it at that.   -Bp  **recon**Subj: see yaCc: **Date: Oct 11 00:42Hey, I remembered I did not put this char on inact and logged on to do so...but thought I'd say so long.   Its been a real pleasure to know ya, and I appreciate the way you always conducted yourself here.

If I think of anything nastier than I've already ran, I'll try it, but it would appear to be that beanos.com is significantly faster than mudservices, which would also lead me to believe it will be a lot more stable, and conducive to having more player population :) **mizan**Subj: dispair/howdy/moadeepCc: boltar,vertebraker,x,earwax,fred,mizanDate: Jul 18 18:24Dispair was apparently banished, but i did not see him actually doing anything bad for some time...

The perception is that if you do a guild, nobody wil lfuck with it...and it's true...fred approached me about the sam  shit, i told him what to do, asked him to do it, and he won't touch it. The general player perception, even from your boy worm, is that if it's yours, nobody will touch it, you being you.  Now, I enter the picture and that changes of course.  So the implication is that I'm the only one that will go against you, and that's not necessarily a good thing because you're considered more a 'players wiz' than I am.  I could care less on that, but what I do care about is that even fucking Fred won't fuck with your shit, and players consider it a fucking wasted cause until I get involved.  Now, our own arguments are well documented, well known, EVERYONE in  the game knows we butt heads in a pretty epic way.  But it seems to me that nowadays I'm considered the only counter to you, and vice versa. What this means to me is that we need to both be around, and handling  things.  And in a bigger sense, I just need you around to handle the misc shit cuz you're too fucking good at it and I'm too fucking bad at it.

The nerfing by earwax was excellent.  I fought Oz.  Who is only guild level 6 bloodfist.  I was barely able to do any damage but I was taking damage very easily.  Even in the Gedan stance I was getting owned by Oz.  He used only 10 kits while I used up over 22-25 kits and a wocket heal. I can understand taking the damage.  What brothers me most is that the Samurai don't have the spirit of the warrior anymore.   No bladestorm or the ability to do damage.  Not to be feared or respected.  Earwax says bladestorm is illegal because of the area of effect has no real rule for it.  I can see that more players would punish the Samurai in a 2v1 fight.  Bladestorm would assist the Sam Samurai's most powerful spell.  Earwax also said the dervish should set the standards for the highest possibly offense because they have no defensive. Which I can understand. Earwax said because he would like to nerf the Samurai even more.The bloodfist already do serious amount of damage and take it rather well.  The Samurai should be able to dish it out.    Yes.  In a 1v1 fight.  A maxed out bloodfist should take down a maxed out Samurai.  But a maxed out Samurai should be able to take down a guild level 6 bloodfist.  Obiviously, there are some problems. Bloodfist seem to get defensive and offensive skills.    While Samurai don't get either because both offensive and defensive were nerfed with no bladestorm.  I ask you.  Is what earwax really said true?  Do you think it its really fair that non maxed bloodfist could smack around a +100 Samurai? Also, Earwax said that senior wizes should be working on the LPMUD and not making new guilds.I love the new guilds.  It really put a breath of life into Nirvana for me.    Your decision.  I ask that you help making a compromise from where Earwax put the Samurai at and what you had them at after all your nerfing   Valen **fred** Re:   need helpCc: boltar,fredDate: Sep  5 16:02Done.  Frep **fred** Re:   ipDate: Sep 12 08:12Done.  Frep **chett**Subj: w00tDate: Oct 20 22:10w00t **earwax**Subj: what the hellDate: Oct 21 22:28I'm finally ready to start making appearances and you inactive,  what the hell :) **sparrow**Subj: Re: FTP and LevelsCc: (To: boltar) fred,xDate: Feb  5 20:07I'm back to help out, enjoying six months of unemployment so I have some time now.

I feel that rather than reopen old guilds, or open new guilds, that touching up current guilds, adding new things to them would catch the attention of ppl we already have back playing. It would be awesome to assign wizards to each guild, trying to update them in anyway we can. That would build intrest in playing/killing more.. at the  same time, ppl would be out leveling more, helping lower levels etc. Just bringing a fresh feel back to the game. Artos feels having a PK Tourny once in awhile would help. He pointed out attracting pkers, ppl who like to chat a lot over public channels would also help gain intrest for players in the game, attracting old/new players etc. Honestly, I think the MUD has already taken a breath of fresh air and is on a nice roll. I'm just hoping we can all pitch in, in any way we can to help it keep on rolling. So, even though i'm just a player, I figured i'd start pestering you guys with ideas.. some i'm sure you'll blow off, others I hope you'll consider. Although, once again, i'd like to point out one thing.. I know rules are in place and need to be followed, but I think warnings should be given. Like a strike 1,2,3 and you're jailed.. rather than just jailing and banning.  To tell you the truth, losing just one player could lead to possibly losing his friends. While we're trying to revive this place, I think every player counts. I know Bolts ends up at the end of all the drama, so I think the wizards should handle most things themselves, without jailing when possible. I'm just hoping we can find a way to keep it fun for everyone involved.  Anyway, thanks for your time.. if you've read this far. ;)  -me *8 oopsee **nefarious**Subj: Request to wiz.Cc: (To: fred) boltar,mizan,xDate: May  6 17:45I have no idea why you all feel the need to discriminate against me. I have been contributing in everyway I can for quite sometime now. Admit it or not, I am the one who started gathering back up players for your game.

Wipeout is my cousin. He lives 30 min away. He is 19 and a little spoiled Bratt.  about 10 days or so ago wipeout came on and told Khrell and Ill that he wanted to be dewizzed  cause he no longer wanted to code.  Later when he  and I were both on I ask if that was what he wanted  and he stated yes So, I granted HIS wish and dewizzed him.  He had issues with his guild object and the wiz channel. He stated  he had some where to go , so I told him I would snoop him and use the force cmd to get it fix and he was fine with that.  I fixed the guild obj and with Rump's help we fix the wiz channel issue.  After that he came back instead of saying thanks he demands I give him  2 more levels cause he was sure he was 19+23 when he wizzed but the log's showed he was 19+21.  Then he got pissed and started in "So, I am lying. you can look?" "at the log's.  I was 19+23" and a bunch more crap came out him mouth...  I told him I would see if it  was possible for mizan to look at saved logs when he wizzed but that I was not adding them without proof. Did I mention he is a whiner and a bratt? oh I did Well mean while his mom (my aunt) I am 35 by the way, and his brothers told me he was caught using weed. I aske him about it here cause he was not answering his cell, he gave me a bunch of crap then too and logged off.  The the day I jailed him I logged on  one of my test char that worm made a shard so that I could fix some guild issues.  Wipeout on tells  and on star start about how me and other wizzes are spying on him and the shard.  That were abusing our powers. That I am snooping him, which u can check the logs and  see it was only the day I dewizzed him. I tried to deal with him with on tells but  on star cause he wanted to make it an issue. at some point he told me I was in big trouble and he was gonna put me in my place. I gave him one more chance to stop being and ass and unruly.  He did not so I jailed him for 1 day.

I am not messing with you because quite frankly you are not worth the time for me to mess with. I do not mess with people like you because there is frankly no real motivation to do so.

I don't really care about what he does or says, and I have encouraged other wizzes not to provoke him by even responding to anything he has to say. Yes. That is my official stance. Just flat out ignore him no matter how irritating his words may be. Don't bother him, don't help him, don't hinder him, just ignore him completely. But let him speak.  I know it sounds counter-intuitive but I encourage you to do the same, and even spread the word about it to others if possible. Delorean may be a griefer and a selfish little twit, but he has a right to login to this game and play.  In the past I have not been as saintly and approachable either, and I recognize that. In the past I have done things like delete his characters or siteban him and it has not changed his behavior. When I returned to here a few months ago,  I made an offer to start off with him on a clean slate. I believe I have held my end of the bargain. However he has chosen not to. But I'm cool with that.  Rather than wipe him off the MUD i chose a different vent for dealing with him. I made a comic which features some of his antics, of which there are two episodes so far visible at:  http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/a-barycentric-griefing-motion/ and http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/the-third-fastest-thing-in-the-world/  Again, I encourage others to simply ignore him, and let peace and contentedness be in your soul rather than pure rage that (insertDeityHere) has forsaken us and left us such a miserable little shitfucker to suffer with. Delorean and his kind are a vital part of this MUD's ecosystem, as we need diversity... strong PK'ers, roleplayers, socialites, coders, whining douchebags- We need them all.  There is a saying in Arabic which does not translate well, but I'll try- "I let my enemies dine at my doorstep because it is my pleasure, God willing." So paraphrased my take on that is: "I let Delorean play here and speak what he wants because it is my pleasure."  So you know what to do. The next stupid thing he does, mudmail me a transcript and I will credit you appropriately on my next comic strip(s).  Thank you for reading. -Miz **worm**Subj: WoW Sir Robin!Cc: vertebrakerDate: Sep 15 12:57 playin on the Kalecgos server.. pvp, medium population..  got Fakir there playin too.. he can fund us, heh.  come grind with a nigga!  my name there is Mortsilencie (silent death in french) :P  if ya start, mail me there or here.  i quit playin here pretty much, but i check my mail daily.  take care brotha  -me **mizan**Subj: wormCc: mizanDate: Sep 16 21:59X tells you: heh, btw. i told worm wizing bella would be a bad idea. she had her chance, twice. i told her it wasn't a good idea either.  Yeah, i washed my hands clean of all that. Worm still blames me for it anyhow because he didnt get what he wanted, right away. To be honest i am sick of trying to reason with him. Oddly enough you were one of the people who he told me would have zero problems if Jen was wizzed. I didn't want to think of the possibility but it is now clear to me that he was just trying to pressure me into instawizzing jen without getting anyone's feedback on the situation.  -tij **mizan** Re:   wormCc: mizanDate: Sep 19 11:00I'm sorry you got sucked into this at all. Worm mentioned your name as being one of the people who backed Jen coming back. I think this whole thing is going to blow over as is, so it's not a big deal at this point anyhow. Thanks for letting me know...  -tij **boltar** Re:   IP lockDate: Dec 29 23:07 done...  **wicket**Subj: Guild Issues W/ Samurai EmperorDate: Aug 14 00:35been having issues with conduct of a samurai that is out of the line of conduct conflicting with the rules of the guild.

I proposed this a long time ago, was approved in the large scale if I could get a functioning small scale example running to test, lets say limited to an area.  Take a look at : /players/sparrow/open/propDocs/economy.txt  IT is something that Nirvana needs badly, which will also require editing almost every standard file in the game. Want to have some fun then?  Also FYI the skill doc that Illarion is in that directory too. -S **sparrow**Subj: lost causeCc: vertebrakerDate: Feb  5 01:56I need to know, are you trying to make nirvana into a viable game again that can compete in the market or are you slapping some smilely face band aids that'll give the two people that still log in a little fun. If it's the latter then by all means carry on. But trying to convert nirvana into a copetitive, modern mud is going to prove to be impossible. Just to implement an  economy would require everything to be rewritten.  I've been looking at mudlibs, I've pretty much setteled on dead souls as my base. I'm not going to try to sell it to you, I'm  not looking to compete with nirvy. But if you are interested in being a creative force behind something fresh then check out the lib and let me know. I love nirvy but she lost her  best feature, the people. They made the dizzyingly con- fusing unmappable areas, zero continuity, pathetic selection of good gear (everyone uses the same "best" shit), and shifted focus to the player run guilds. The flaws, although glaringly obvious became finsignificant next to the RP that dominated in the early 90s peaking during the guild wars. Large groups of players and a simple combat system was all that was needed. Then came what I feel is directly responsible for nirvys demise. Weak Ineffectual Administrators Player run muds work wonderfully as long as nothing under- mines the strictand simple power higherarchy. Jebuly is GC over Wulfgar because Jeb is 19+21(stupidest level structure) and wulf is 15. THis was ruined by letting any pervert that can read a cheat seat turn himself and his tiny penis into what is essentially a god on nirvana. Unrestricted and un- accountable wizzing then began endless cycles of guild pumping and nerfing, closing guild and losing players  until every guild was a generic swiss army knife clone that had everything a lone player could need. So if you want to be part of something epic let me know. Dead Souls 3 is just built right, complete, solid it just feels right. Yes there will be heavy modifications but I wont have to spend two years getting the areas to  load again because we had to update the driver to allow decimals...  anyways...you no dummy you get it... end rant **sparrow**Subj: Guess you wont be aroundDate: Feb  8 19:39Well I guess you wont be around.

On top of those whom he invited, I've invited close to 30 people myself, and hopefully they have more people they can invite as well. In light of this, and knowing I don't have that kind of access, we would like to request a couple of things from the administration, in hopes it will help bring life back to the mud. The first of those requests, is a significant increase, or even maybe removal, of the limit on the number of players that can be in a party. If even half of the people invited make it, there will be 15+ people on at one time, many of whom we can surely say would love to socially group together, definitely with more than 5 to a group. Or, as an alternative (I'm not sure how hard it would be to do by comparison), maybe make it so you can link groups together. Like, form 2 5-person parties, and link them so the channel and experience gains are linked between the groups. Without the social aspect of the mud, it won't go very far in the way of trying to bring it back from the dead, and this sort of thing would help incredibly. The other request is in regards to the alignment killing restriction of Power Rangers. Even if it's just for the reunion day, we would like to request this restriction be lifted, as I know for a fact several of the attendees will be playing their Ranger characters. With this restriction lifted, even if it is just for a day, it will help as far as not limiting where and what these groups (or hopefully, one really big group! lol) can go after. Rangers are generally limited to barely more than half of the mud's npcs, and this would take much of the fun from the reunion day's attentees, knowing they only have a small amount of stuff to do, then waiting for respawns and such. Lastly, this is more of a personal request, if there's anyone you all know, that we were unable to get ahold of to let know this reunion is happening, please take a moment to pass along word of the event, its date, and if they haven't been around since the address changed, the new one of course! Many thanks for the time and help in this from you all. This will hopefully be a day to remember of Nirvana's already colorful history! Hope to see you all there! Sincerely, Chip **boltar** Re:   Mud reunion on Sunday Feb 17, 2013Cc: (To: chip) fred,sparrow,mizan,rumplemintz,illarion,x,vertebraker,angelDate: Feb 11 09:08Paragraphs please.
