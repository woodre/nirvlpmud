Now get cracking! --Gnar **lebronjames**Subj: great mud appDate: Oct  3 03:13Mudlet 2.1 is a nice program.  It's not available in the app store so you just gotta do a google search for it and make sure your security preferences allow you to use non-Apple approved programs.  It's good, basically like a Gmud.  I needed to change the font type and size and now I'm good to go.   **marek**Subj: restitutionDate: Oct  3 10:17Find a newbie and pay them 10,000 coins with no explanation.  That is your restitution. **dragnar**Subj: Clan locker roomsCc: (To: mosh) chrono,symbio,rumi,titan,skanDate: Oct  6 12:15I'm pretty sure clan locker rooms will no longer clean items dropped in them. Not all clan rooms, only locker rooms. Please help me test to make sure! Thanks **marek**Subj: healersDate: Oct  7 09:24Healers that are actively healing a criminal in a pk fight should be warned, after the warning that said healer would be placed on the criminal list as aiding criminals however. if they are healing everyone in the green as they come to her i dont feel this is grounds to be made criminal.  **rumi**Subj: Gear and prestigeCc: (To: lebronjames) rumiDate: Oct 13 16:51250k xp away from Prestige 1, woot.  Check the clan lockers regularly because now that they don't clean i regularly leave bags with shit in there for whenever.  Peace **"
