Just because this happened with many wizzes present idecided to still give it a writeup anyhow for posterity.Fawn was observed to be using something that resembled a triggerscript. I noticed it myself but did not realize they were stillquite illegal- but other wizzes (Jaraxle and Gemini) also noticedand mentioned it on channel wiz. At least 5 wizzes were presentat one point, i wasnt totally keeping track. Boltar was around butpreoccupied to a degree fixing an /obj level problem.Anyhow- What was being triggered was the command 'kill beano', and subsequentcorpse management process. I had released a pile of ordinary strengthBeanos that pelt players with water balloons, and PKers with pilesof shit. These are easily dispatched low level monsters. They werewandering around in the village spine, kind of a gag item as playerswere hunting them down, getting wet or fecal in the process.I decided to release a mutated beano that would go in turbo mode-essentially WC5000 if someone from Fawn's IP attacked it. Sure enoughafter at least 20 scripted killings, she died to one of these beanos.The channel spammage aftermath was a little severe, wizzes wererough (especially myself) but i dont think anything truly over theline happened.Files: Near the end of the Beano invasion, where Fawn dies:This file is actually good to 'more' from the mud command promptwhere all ANSI is preserved, or if you have an ANSI-friendly textfile viewer./players/mizan/OPEN/fawn_killed_by_beano.txtArchive of modified Beano:/players/mizan/OPEN/beano-wandering-v3-archive.cThanks!-m**aingeal**Subj: GeminiCc: (To: noirceur) scatheDate: Nov 25 10:17Noirceur,I need to speak with you briefly about Gemini.  Please let me know when you will be on,or when it would be convenient to talk to you.  Thanks.Aingeal**aingeal**Subj: ScatheCc: (To: gemini) scatheDate: Nov 25 15:41Gemini,I reviewed your two mudmails, and I have spoken with both Scathe and a witness who was awareof your exchange with Scathe / Noirceur (as you indicated that both were on).  Although it is clearthe two of you were not very nice to each other, I did not see any behavior that rose to the levelof harassment.  Juvenile flapping, yesharassment, no.  Thus, I am taking no official action againstScathe / Noirceur.  However, I have suggested to him, as I now suggest to you, that since it appears that you are both able to easily push each other's buttons, so to speak, you both might want to make an effort to not do so, and to not rise to the baiting of the other.I'm required to tell you that you have the right to appeal my decision to one of the appealswizards, if you wish.  The best course of action is for both of you to either treat each other with respect, or to simply leave each other alone.  Please let me know if you haveany questions about my decision.Aingeal**puppy**Subj: BASTID!!!Date: Dec 23 19:20You know my cousin called me last nigth just to make sure I knew his packers score of the game they were playing.

I have been giving it to people individuallyand with a stern lecture- but also with a degree of trust ithat theywill have some common sense when using the things.Some samples of the code live in /open/mizan/ - gstool*.c and gsitem*.c.Those are the people who have been given copies of the device.-m**vertebraker**Subj: alchsDate: May  5 15:52do you have a copy of the alch source?**boltar** Re:   Guild GuidelinesDate: May  6 14:29the guild wizard sets membership critera.I expect wizards to follow that criteria and be consistant with it.I other words, if you say level 10s with a 15 strength then you cannot deny those who meet that critera because you don't like them.However, if the criteria says: Guild wizard must approve membership, thenyou get to say no to anyone you'd like.  All I ask is that the rules for membership be up front and consistantly applied.**earwax** Re:   File checkDate: May  9 11:45Yeah, he should have died - it does random(80) damage, but it bugged because therewas no attacker - so when that happens sometimes there is a buggy death, andfrankly, he should be grateful that it was a buggy death (that a room killedhim) since he probably lost less exp that way.  Anyways, what happens is thatwith hit_player() you have to have something defined as attacker, it's a bugin eurales, he should have a mob called 'tree' or 'falling' or something,set the players attack to that, (mob being elsewhere, just for purposesof having SOMETHING registered as hitting the player), and then do thehit_player() ... or something heh :)Anyways, he should have died, if it killed him it did lethal damage, noother way....the death process itself is what bugged, not the result ofone.**vertebraker**Subj: dataDate: May 17 19:13Hey.. what's your take on data?Do you have any specific cases of him abusing wizpowers?Let me know dood.. we are considering disciplinary action.Thanksv**vertebraker**Subj: demoted.Date: Aug  1 17:58You're demoted.**"
