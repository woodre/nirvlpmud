messages "star**Subj: Your areaDate: Sep  5 02:41I'm right now working on Gideon's approval, and yours is next. However, due to seeing the same things all the time, and having people get angry and frustrated with me when I ask them to change things, I wrote up a file containing the standards I expect to see. Before I get to yours, you might want to give it a read and check your area for all the most common things that I will jump on and ask that you change.  The filename is /open/star/approvals.guide I'll admit it's a bit long, but please take some time to look it over.  In the end, it will benefit both of us, but likely you more than me.  I print out areas and sit at work checking them, so it's no skin off my nose.  I'm even getting paid.  But the fewer things I want you to change, the happier you will be.  *8)  -Star **"
