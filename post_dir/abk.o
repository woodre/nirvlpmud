For some reason I forgot to put in a line for it to autoload properly. Thanks for the heads up! Btw.... no wizard will ever need your password for anything, so be sure to never give it out! Chip :) **chip**Subj: PSDate: Apr 20 15:04make sure you read the new help file 'link beta' Chip **chip**Subj: reportsDate: Apr 21 00:461) # of tentacles covered by armor: when you wear each piece, one at a time, check 'tentacles' and see how many more are covered than were before you wore it 2) dual wielding: I'll seriously consider it. 3) offense/defense: remember, you're still a very low guild rank ;) it will get much better, believe me though I still do have plans of upping power in general sometime in the not too distant future.  Thank's for the submissions! I'll keep them on the log for further referencing. Chip **chip**Subj: ExplainDate: Apr 22 03:19I hope you've a good explanation of how you're maxed with less than 2 million exps into the guild. if there isn't one there very well may be some severe disciplinary actions, unless i feel like being extra nice and just setting you back to the appropriate rank. Thanks. -Chip **chip**Subj: dude.Date: Apr 22 11:06I'm disappointed. Cheating by adding 31 million xps to your character from your wiz. Wtf, I thought you were better than that. Chip **"
