messages "mizan**Subj: You are a grieferCc: (To: hawkman) whitehawk,mizan,boltar,fred,x,star,illarion,sparrow,khrell,shinshi,aingeal,angel,captpotatoDate: Aug 10 22:44You quit out of the game while I was trying to diagnose an issue for you, but not before launching a diatribe about morals and other bullshit. This was your last tell:  22:35:04 Hawkman tells you: my point is its not right and it shows someone is messing with things they shouldnt be  Can you prove this? I am not messing with you because quite frankly you are not worth the time for me to mess with. I do not mess with people like you because there is frankly no real motivation to do so. It is not rewarding, and the fact that you whine about anything and everything makes it rather annoying on top of it all. For the record, while you were pestering me with tells, I was busy, preparing the new server which will replace the current machine that this game runs on. I don't appreciate your sass and as a directive to anyone else who cares to listen, I will only say this: Everyone, please ignore Whitehawk and any of his characters unless you are prepared to devote ALL and EVERY IOTA of  attention to his well being, his desires, and all of his general wants. Which for most of us (since we are not paid and do this for the fun of it)... will be NEVER.  There is no wizard conspiracy against you, because I will speak for many if not all- We consider your whining presence simply not worth the effort. We have other things to conspire about, such as what to do with Jimmy Hoffa's entombed corpse in Giants Stadium when the facility is scheduled for demolition. It's really a fucking pain in the ass because while ALL of us were present when his tattered, bloated corpse was dumped unceremoniously into the cement- none of us are sure of EXACTLY where he is buried.  SO PLEASE forgive us if we dont respond right away to your princely presence (within 2 seconds) because right now the loss of Hoffa's exact location is fucking Khrell's fault, and he still hasn't paid me back for those beers.  Yours sarcastically, Captain Assjesus **"
