I want to finish the animate command  for them. Similar to the mage andead spell, it allows them to make a zombie/skeleton from a corpse. Interesting though they don't have a limit on the number that can be raised. It does continue to sap SPS from the player though. My thought is as follows: 1. Make the zombie/skeleton stats based on the exp of the corpse. So you can't kill a bunch of altarboys and make an army of zombies. An altarboy mob would make a very poor zombie, tougher mobs would make much tougher zombies. 2. Leave the SPS drain, the more zombies the bigger the SPS will be. I'll change it so if you run out of SPS the zombie destructs. 3. Currently they last for about 5 mins and that feels about right to me. I might tweak it to be based on the exp value of the mob. Does this sounds reasonable to you? I don't want to move forward if it doesn't have a chance of getting approved. Thanks! --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: necrosCc: **Date: Oct 29 09:47Please add summon to your tweak list. pestilence is cool but the level  restrictions are nuts. **dragnar**Subj: Necro AnimateCc: (To: fred) samiDate: Nov  2 16:29Hey Fred, I updated the necro animate spell. I simplified it quite a bit and added the zombie. Can you just look it over and make sure it looks OK? Thanks, --John/Gnar **sektor**Subj: sektor enforcerCc: mertoDate: Nov 11 18:01help me get enforcer spot im on every day just about here and there vote has already been cr created* **dragnar**Subj: Login BonusCc: (To: fred) shinshi,sami,wicketDate: Dec 22 09:55I've had this idea every since I did prestige, and I want to work on it soon. I would like to give the players a prize for logging in on a regular basis. I was thinking daily and weekly prizes. Feel free to mail me ideas on what the prizes could be.  . Some idea I already have are gold, casino chips, heals etc. I also have some unique scrolls I have been working on for an upcoming area. They give unique 1 time abilities that raise your wc bonus, give a double xp, bless armor/weps, make any weapon unbreakable etc. I was thinking about using these for some of the bigger prizes. . Let me know any thoughts ideas you have. Thanks, --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: lick and runCc: **Date: Jan 12 10:49You need to stay logged in enough for me to un-idle... **dragnar**Subj: damn youCc: **Date: Feb 18 14:05Stop doing a lick and run  ) **daven**Subj: beta test charCc: **Date: Jul 21 14:54yo homie if you need a beta tester for anything im down **dragnar**Subj: new gear inCc: **Date: Sep  9 10:54Added, fixed some references and added to the orb.

I finally got around to adding the functionality to room.c.  You can use the new: set_call_out( string co, int interval, int rand_interval )  to set the name of the call_out function, the interval and random interval. . In the inherited room you do set_call_out in the reset, then define the function that will be the target of the call_out. I'll put an example in /doc/build/room/call_outs. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: GPOCc: **Date: Jan 25 10:42Reports for: /players/sami/area/GPO/medlab6 Aug 17 19:34 2016 :: darkfire In this room, the east exit actually moves you two rooms to the east, not one. . Hey bud, I know you're busy but can you check on this one? Thanks man! --John **"
