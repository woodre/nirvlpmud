Just because this happened with many wizzes present idecided to still give it a writeup anyhow for posterity.Fawn was observed to be using something that resembled a triggerscript. I noticed it myself but did not realize they were stillquite illegal- but other wizzes (Jaraxle and Gemini) also noticedand mentioned it on channel wiz. At least 5 wizzes were presentat one point, i wasnt totally keeping track. Boltar was around butpreoccupied to a degree fixing an /obj level problem.Anyhow- What was being triggered was the command 'kill beano', and subsequentcorpse management process. I had released a pile of ordinary strengthBeanos that pelt players with water balloons, and PKers with pilesof shit. These are easily dispatched low level monsters. They werewandering around in the village spine, kind of a gag item as playerswere hunting them down, getting wet or fecal in the process.I decided to release a mutated beano that would go in turbo mode-essentially WC5000 if someone from Fawn's IP attacked it. Sure enoughafter at least 20 scripted killings, she died to one of these beanos.The channel spammage aftermath was a little severe, wizzes wererough (especially myself) but i dont think anything truly over theline happened.Files: Near the end of the Beano invasion, where Fawn dies:This file is actually good to 'more' from the mud command promptwhere all ANSI is preserved, or if you have an ANSI-friendly textfile viewer./players/mizan/OPEN/fawn_killed_by_beano.txtArchive of modified Beano:/players/mizan/OPEN/beano-wandering-v3-archive.cThanks!-m**boltar**Subj: phantoms....Date: Nov 28 01:10 seems players are killing these things like orcs, doubt it was your intent... wanna beef em up ? the exp value is too much for how fast they are killed...-Bp**pestilence**Subj: VampiresCc: (To: fred) jaraxle,euraleDate: Nov 28 14:16Just wondering if you guys knew that thevamp who shows everyone that is invis, atleast player wise,a +3 could see the location of breeti +100.And also did someone change it so that maalox are soleyfor vampire use?

He should bekilling something else.  This might partiallydiscourage people from killing something en masse.The third time, he gets a -10% drop.The fourth, a -5% drop.The fifth, there is no drop.And the sixth he goes back to a -5% drop.We can debate the particulars if you want butit is my Vital's belief that the 2nd time shouldbe the kick in the ass to try to push people to killsomewhere else.  Then again, as Wocket points out,this system would probably still allow peopleto kill their favorite mobs over and over if theyare willing to take a small hit.Reboot [or a crash, knock on wood...] wouldstart the cycle over due to file size problems.**fakir**Subj: exp bonus/etc.Cc: (To: vertebraker) boltar,wocket,vital,fred,jaraxle,pain,sandmanDate: May 25 22:00I like your idea of an exp. drawback.

In any case, that's what this is about.  The way I see it, PK is lacking for the following reasons:Risk without rewardPulling kills without a gangbang - people run/quit instead of dyingLearning curve is steep...it's harsh to learn, and dying sucksPK without risk sucks - rangers just get another ranger to kill them     and unset their pk - we've all seen this heh     (that was just an example, other guilds do it of course)PK tends to be dominated by packs - shards together, ninja together, etcSimply no reason to set - why bother, don't get anything from itLow playerbaseThose are the primary issues, at least that I can come up with right now.If there are others, let me know, but I think those are the core problems.What I'm looking for is suggestions to either reduce those issues, eliminate them, or encourage pk in other ways.  Any ideas are helpful,I'm not looking for 'pk sucks oh well' or so-and-so is a flap bastard,I'm looking for well, how about we have this.... or could we do this...Some of my own thoughts:Shards will revitalize pk at least initially - they will hit the mud     with a vengeance, and give others someone to kill, and reason to.We need some pk-required-to-enter areas and pker-only gear.We need a rewards system for pkers (something I hope to help with the     pk tracker at some point).We need either lower risk (but still some risk) or greater rewards in     general for pk. More players - better noob retention/training, more stuff and reason     for current players, especially bigger ones to play more.     To attract and retain more players.More PK required guilds - shards, future assassins (former Deathmonger     assassins), possibly a good-aligned, physical guild to oppose     shards/ninja.Anyways, those are my thoughts on what the issues are, and ways to resolve them.  What we need is more complete ideas, hell, any ideas,and for those of you with wizards, hopefully a willingness to codesome things for it.  I know I at least was primarily playing here forpk...and I know others (particularly those with shards) did and do aswell, so let's figure out some things to increase it.  Verte will goalong with anything reasonable I imagine, and do what he can to helpand improve it - this is coming from him btw.  I'm looking for player and wizard contributions, either/or, I just want to do what I can to improve things, so even if it's dumb lemmeknow it :)**usagi**Subj: Misty cloakDate: Jun 13 06:32In the desc of it there's a typo.. it says claok instead of cloak..Just thought you might wanna know.Usagi**linus**Subj: LaptopCc: (To: earwax) dakeyras,forbin,mosobp,humble,pestilence,fred,mizan,jareel,coldwind,pike,cerberus,subotai,cooper,hoyle,sundin,greymir,symbio,fakir,snakespear,zeus,mode,wocket,jaraxle,vital,ravennight,blade,tony,usagi,psychax,entreriDate: Jun 16 14:43FIX THE FUCKING LAPTOP!!!!!!!Nothing is more frustrating than to see all these candy asses get uber high levels just so they can't be seen by the laptop.  This enables them to have a huge advantage if they choose to pk...being able to hunt invis players lower than them, and if they choose not to, gives them free run of any pk areas with little to no risk of being seen there.Go back to having to letting it see all levels, and have it run on batteries that cost $$ and run out over time.This will at least put most everyone on a more level playing field.  Cash is so easy to come by anymore, it's not like buying batteries will be a pain in the ass.This could also prevent people from waiting until they're +75 to finally set pk.Other than that, we just need more incentive...some it's just the adrenaline rush/ego stroke that works, but to actually pull people that normally wouldn't pk in, there's gotta be less risk, more reward.Maybe less of a death penalty...1/8 xp instead of 1/3?  Also maybe a no loot thing.  This way there's no fear of losing that Gordie stick that you had to suck off a +100 for or whatever.  Most of the pkers give shit back anyway, unless the victim is a whiny little bitch or just a plain asshole, but if there's a definate no loot thing, maybe people will be more likely to try.Ok..this would lead to a "Why the fuck should I pk if I don't get anything for it?"Good question.  How about a reward system based on pk points.  Both the MK-Scar and PK-trakker assign points for various pks.  Now say I had 250 pk points.  I could go to the uber-bsness-pk shop and lay down those points to buy some kickass pk only weapon and/or armor.

There are a few reasons for this kind of system, including (and of course not limited to): guilds to be thematic additions rather than requirements for chars to be feasible; a standardized system lessening the need for complex combat code in guilds, allowing the coding wizzes to focus more on content/theme than combat stuff; standardizing simply gives us a better system to work from, more consistent from guild to guild, while not losing variety - we should gain variety since simply changing a few tricks and spell names won't cut it anymore; this kind of system will be extremely addicting for new players as they will SEE their characters improving  dramatically right from the time they start playing - seeing your skills going up over and over is very addicting, trust me, it's the key to any success DragonHeart MUD has enjoyed, and was part of the appeal to Mal's Warrior guild.  Another advantage to this is that it rewards players for actually killing stuff rather than hitting behind someone, as the majority won't trigger unless the player is taking hits; yet another advantage of this system is that it opens up a variety of ways to play even a guildless character ("Adventurer's Guild?") - they can wear medium armor and focus more on dodging/parrying attacks and using counterattack, or they can wear the heavy gear and use shields for shield block/bash.  The skills will be reliant both on attributes (which will be undergoing a revision as well, to make them more important, and less uniform from char to char), and usage-based raising.  There will be two basic categories: automatic, and initiated; automatic being skills that the game attempts to use automatically, and initiated being ones that the player has to type a command to use.  They will be on a percentage basis as well, with 5% being probably the minimum.    Skills (of both varieties) will be raised automatically, in a manner similar to Maledicta's Warriors, or more closely, to the system in place on  DragonHeart MUD.  The skills will have a % chance to happen, and when they happen, a % chance to improve: higher chance at lower skill levels, low at the higher end.    Skills will also have prerequisites.  For example, riposte (counterattack) requires parrying a blow.  Because of that, the powerful counterattack  ability will take much longer to max than the parry ability.  There will be advanced skills as well - for example, enhanced dodge, which requires the regular dodge skill to be maxxed.  Sorry for the spammage, but there was a lot to cover.  Keep in mind that this is the absolute first draft, it requires a lot of fleshing out in  order to code, as well as having the attribute and race revisions already in place.  As much input as possible is critical in designing this sytem, so please, formulate some opinions and mail them to me, either on here, or to dhalek@comcast.net.  Thanks.  -Earwax **earwax**Subj: Skills proposal: specificsCc: (To: vertebraker) vital,illarion,fred,subotai,mosobp,linus,jaraxle,pestilence,forbinDate: Oct  9 04:45Defense:   General:     Dodge     Parry     Drunken Fighting (increased ability while intoxicated)        Unarmed:     Unarmed Dodge (req: dodge)     Unarmed Parry    Armed:     Armed Dodge (req: dodge)     Armed Parry (req: Parry)     Shield Block  Offense:   General:     Finish (deathblow, messages patterned off MK fatalities?)     Riposte (requires a successful parry)     Negate Armor/Study (enhanced odds of hitting through AC)     Drunken Style?        Unarmed:     Unarmed Attack (increased odds of hitting opponent)     Unarmed Riposte (instead of general riposte?)     Advanced Unarmed (req: attack, multi-hits/round, better odds)    Armed:     Armed Attack     Shield Bash (req successful shield block? or builds off it?)     Advanced Armed Attack (req armed attack, mebbe xtra attacks)     Offwield (50% damage in offwield)     Two-Hander Tactics     Perhaps specialization in each weapon type (sword, polearm, etc)  General/Magic:   First Aid (heal)   Castle Spell   Consider   Offer   Examine (prots/dtypes on gear)   Sharpen Weapon   Repair Weapon   Repair Armor   Analyze Opponent (find out rough dtype prots/ac/etc on opponent)   Combat spells (mi,sh,fi,so)   Invisibility   Call Imp/Demon Merchant (I'd really like to see this in core abilities) **sparkle**Subj: JaraxleCc: (To: francesco) jaraxle,sparkleDate: Oct 10 00:45So Jaraxle added some new rooms to his existing area today and he asked me to go through and check them for him.
