messages "whitehawk**Subj: Stealing guild equipmentDate: Aug 27 11:59Look the tug is for all members of the guild and if you ever bothered to read up on it you would see all eq is expected to be returned. If the reason for not returning isnt dying then what is? Good Eq? some of us put that eq in there because its good and we can tug it while we are on to either wield it or strap it. If by chance you want to keep it please be so kind as to put another weapon of equal or greater value in its place.   A little Annoyed Whitehawk **"
