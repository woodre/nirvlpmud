It is in the bestinterest of our bloodlines to share our gift with you.If you are able to find other members of the Family who would also extend to you this invitation, then by all means avail your-self of that opportunity, but also know that your presence is nowactively sought by myself and others.Respectfully,HottentotThe Vampire Shining One**razalin**Subj: RE: Thanks.Cc: (To: braeden) weyless, sticks, razalinDate: Jun  5 10:38Do not blame ME, it was not my micontrue - but your own error in judgement. You should have known better than to pull a stunt like that, even if it was a joke. I have had the opportunity to speak with Morpheus, but did not have a chance to catch Sticks yet. Your quickness to blame me doesn't make me wish to pursue it any further.   Good Luck. **razalin**Subj: BraedenCc: (To: sticks) razalin,weylessDate: Jun  5 10:43I had told Braeden that I would speak with Morpheus on that little matter of the bag so that he could "prove his innocence." I did... and Morpheus confirmed that Braeden was just fooling around and I believe that. I don't think it should make a difference, because of the nature of the "joke," timing and other factors involved. However, I gave him my word and I am following through with it. Whatever you choose to do with this information is up to you.    I would like to point out one more thing, just in case this does sway you to reaccept braeden. Apparently, I didn't act fast enough to his liking... and so he sent me this in a mail:  From: braeden Subj: Thanks.  Date: Jun  4 21:27  Heh, your miscontrue caused my forever exclusion from your guild.  This greatly  disappoints me, but I would like to thank you for your time.  Tell Weyless I sai d hello :) Have a wonderful day.  braeden.   Maybe I'm reading it wrong, but that reads to me like a really sarcastic "fuck you bitch." And I'm rather offended that he's blaming me instead of his own lack of intelligence. (LOL)  This was my response: Do not blame ME, it was not my micontrue - but your own error in judgement. You  should have known better than to pull a stunt like that, even if it was a joke.  I have had the opportunity to speak with Morpheus, but did not have a chance to  catch Sticks yet. Your quickness to blame me doesn't make me wish to pursue it a ny further.   And with this mail, this issue is forever over with me. My conscience couldnt allow me to just let it go. A promise is a promise.  Razalin **wolfe**Subj: VampiresCc: (To: razalin) weylessDate: Jun  9 00:32Hello, My name is Wolfe. I am very interested in becoming a part of your family, and I have posted a note of my application upon your guild board,  and would greatly appreciate it if you could take the time to read it. Sincerely, Wolfe. **"
