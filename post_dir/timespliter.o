messages "dragnar**Subj: ffireCc: wulfeDate: Sep  8 19:52Bad news, ffire has never done anything except have cool  messages. The ffire object was calling register_armor on the mob to lower the ac. However, register_armor does not exist in living.c . One thing about LPC is you call a function that doesn't exist and it doesn't return an error. Makes bugs like this hard to track down.  This is fixed now, but I have ideas on how this could be way more interesting! --Gnar/John **"
