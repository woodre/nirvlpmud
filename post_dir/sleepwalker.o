I'm still looking into the difs in the mon and score.  Fred **earwax**Subj: bug repsDate: Feb  7 11:02can you clarify them in the future?  demons_bane_dip pod spam  Those are not very informative...  good to see you on and moving about tho :)  -ew **fred** Re:   more informationCc: earwax,fredDate: Feb 22 13:43The horn is fixed.  Will have to look at the pod yet.  I glanced but didn't notice anything that would cause it offhand.  Fred **sleepwalker**Subj: Source ControlCc: (To: earwax) sleepwalkerDate: Dec 24 02:20Earwax,  Source control is something that professional software companies use to protect their code so that when changes go poorly, the code can be instantly reverted back to a previous version that worked.   An additional advantage is that the casual browsing developer can see what the old code did and how it did it. So if you added to the poly's another developer could go in and see how Mizan did things before that.   From your comments there seems to be some sort of ownership  issue with browsing different areas of the source. If that is the case then source control would be something to consider carefully or alternately one could consider what the basis is for certain areas of source code being private. If there are good reasons  (which is entirely possible), private areas can be made browsable by only certain developers.   In the end Nirvana is what is important, and as we know, Nirvana is code. To protect that code I advocate the MUD use source control. If you need pointers on how to do that cheaply  and easily let me know and I can send you pointers.   Happy to help,   theSLEEP **dara**Subj: ThanksDate: Jan  3 08:17And Happy New Year to you! :) **sleepwalker**Subj: tipsCc: (To: hadus) sleepwalkerDate: May  3 01:21Hadus,   Thanks for the tips. But you never mentioned anything about in-fight. What's the approach there? Every round I hit you with my standard guild spell - then I belated remembered in the fog of memory that I can also hit with other guild spells? Does that sound right? Did they get you? Who can say? You mentioned that you take it hard in the cyber guild hall which implies that there must be something there which hurts you more than outside, but I was hitting you with standard and guild spells so it's difficult to say what else would hit you in the  hall.   Anyway, thanks for the tutorial.  theSLEEP **"
