I wasnt here or I would have handled it on the spot. Sorry bout that guys. **katya**Subj: ArmorsCc: (To: simple) volkar, chupacabraDate: Jul 24 09:48I spoke to Mizan last night, he said he will look into it.  and talk to you.  **boltar** Re:   cheating wizDate: Jul 25 22:14 The wizard responsible has been de-wized.  This was a very serious thing and comes on top of other issues.  The wizard's story did not check out.   -Bp  **mizan**Subj: Veeshan apologyCc: mizan,earwax,fredDate: Jul 26 11:54Did veeshan ever apologize to you? Did you find it to your satisfaction? Veeshan claimed to have apologized to you yesterday morning.  The apology towards you for conduct unbecoming that of a wizard is one of the conditions he must fulfill to restore his wizship.  However being that he lied to me about the events that occurred  that evening, and his continued denial of the (logged) situation his chances of returning as a wizard are almost zero at this point.  For the record:  As for a high level wiz- neither Fred nor Earwax claimed that he was actually investigating anything (it's not their modus operandi to ask junior wizards to do that anyhow), and no player had reported to veeshan any bugs which would prompt any investigation.  Also, it's standard policy for wizards to clone their own objects and not affect production castles/monsters during testing.  Lastly, his claims of 'forgetting' to set Nighttime's test character flag was lame, and to my ears... insulting.  But in any event, please let me know. Thank you. -miz  **mizan** Re:   Veeshan apologyCc: mizanDate: Jul 26 17:11You should never have to feel sorry for stirring up anything. Wizard cheating is taken very seriously, and for the most part it has been eradicated (compared to the past). Things like this need to be brought out and resolved decisively. If anything it is us (collectively all wizards) who should be apologetic to you for allowing a situation like this to be possible. All the warning signs were there- Veeshan had zero code of significance, an attitude problem with people, and a complete lack of coding supervision on our end, mainly because he was considered a lost cause in terms of coding capability.  -miz **mizan**Subj: Busted abusing a bugCc: (To: chupacabra) simple,grudge,volkar,kosh,darque,ensco,redrum,mizan,earwaxDate: Aug  6 00:25I think i need to hear your side of the story on this.  -miz **"
