My idea is player run shops for example:  Timespliter buys the rights to run a heal shop. So no one else from his IP cn own selling rights to other types of shops and he would need to keep the stock in the store up(Basically coins) If a heal cost Timespliter 1000 coins to make and he sold it for 1200 coins 100 of the coins for profit would goto his bank account and 100 would goto taxes for running a shop  in the nirvana economic system.  Other Types of shops could be armor shops, Weapon shops where people could buy and sell specific armor/weapons like a pawn shop.  Profits would be higher in these shops but he demand would be lower than with heals obviously A magic shop where you could get a weapon enchant or magic bags or other types of items.  Dragnar had also suggested some items to upgrade shops that players could make shops cooler so maybe toggle items like did he buy this upgrade .... Also a cavitate to this  is you would not gain coins from your own IP address you would just be able to buy heals wholesale or items wholesale.  If you have worked on a similar project I would like collaborate with you some, if not and you think it sounds like a cool idea I would like to collaborate also....8)  Oh and you can lose a store front if you leave it unattended for 30 days like the old hotel rooms also.  That seemed like a good way to keep people invested but not  over burdened.  Jar. **shinshi**Subj: ShopsDate: Oct  6 08:16fucking LOVE the idea! let's do it! I'm in! **sparrow** Re:   ShopsCc: jareel,dragnar,shinshiDate: Oct  6 14:00I have pondered this exact same thing but have not worked  on it yet but I do have plans for it in the area that I am planning on doing next. I was thinking about some sort of mini-guild for crafting/selling items. For example a Merchant mini-guild lets you open a shop where a weapon- smithing guild lets you create gear. Each has different levels that allow for better gear/better wholesale  or whatnot. That could be overly complicated I guess...  Anyways do I want to work on it? Yes! If we can get it done then that's just one less thing I need to come up with for my area. So either we can brainstorm when we are both on or  continue mudmailing. We should start fleshing it out immediately. Sparrow **sparrow** Re:   ShopsCc: (To: jareel) jareel,dragnar,shinshiDate: Oct  6 14:00I have pondered this exact same thing but have not worked  on it yet but I do have plans for it in the area that I am planning on doing next.

At first it's going to be the  novelty of something new but after that wears off, especially with the playerbase so low what is going to be the draw? It wont be  money, with our current economy coins are pretty much worthless,  they are effortless to amass. So what is the draw? Why would a player set up a shop. Letting them create and sell custom gear is one direction, experience gain is another. We need a dialog on this. -S **sparrow** Re:   ShopsCc: (To: jareel) jareel,dragnar,shinshiDate: Oct 13 09:06One thing we are going to have to sort out first: Why are players going to want to set up a shop.
