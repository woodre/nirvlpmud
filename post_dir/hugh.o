I've changed a few minor thingsaround. The biggest change is changing the title of'Advisor' to 'Politik', because I think all guild officersare advisors.I've removed everyone from office except you, so thatperhaps you can assist the transition into the newoffice system. I've also moved you up the ladderfrom Executor to Directive (the new Directive isone level higher than the old Directive).My intention at this point is for elections to begin,and for you to appoint your own entourage of officers.Assuming of course you still want to be Directive.Dune**orb**Subj: blehDate: Nov  8 06:25i'm drunker than shit, logged on by accident and got promoted to executor....bought nanoblood (expect me to do any different :) anyways, i'm drunker than shit, so demote me and promote me when i kill mode.I really want to kill that fucker anyways, but if/when you feel ready, promote me, I don't think I'm qualified yet, although i wanna keep the nanoblood hehe :)My other question....this is strictly out of character, but i've been promoted in shardaks as well...i'm confident in my ability to character separate, for me, actually, there's no question of itmy main problem is perceptions within cybers, and within shardaks, because i'll do my damndest to do my job as a cyber when on as orb, and do my damndest as a shard when i'm on as scrag, but i don't know how most people think about the issue.originally, i'd have liked to have kept the issue entirely out of question, but between mode blabbing my alt to everyone who would listen, and cybers being beta, it's not much of a secret, so i have to defer in judgement on this oneorb is of course my primary character, plus he's a pimp and i like him more than scrag, but anyways, I wanna know what you have to say on it.  I guess my biggest problem is that people might think that because i have a wizard, a leadership position in cybers, and a leadership position in shardaks, that i'm biased, but i really want to treat all my chars indiviidually.when i'm on as a cyber, i'm all about killing whoever, and when i'm on as my shard i'm the same way, although with beta, that's not really a true test yet.anyways, i'm mainly concerned on how things will look to people, let me know what you thinki don't want to be one of these jackass tartis type players where everyone sits there and flaps about how they don't roleplay.orb is my primary character, but i can only take that so far, i'm raising scrag atm, blehlet me know what you think, heh, you're about the only fucker in this guild that rates a leadership position imho from what i've seen**severance**Subj: my responsesDate: Jan  3 17:42i would like to become a cyberninja because i kinda like the fact that no one plays anymore  because it means a lot of pkers will forget about the powers a cyberninja pker as well as the  fact that i think cyberninjas would suit me because of the ability to attack from the shadows and  being able to fight in the shadows staying hidden cept for when i want others to see me  as to things i would change i would attempt to get some more fresh blood into the cyberninjas  because as you said not many of the old blood players are playing anymore. i think being a  cyberninja means helping other cyberninjas out when needed as well as having the guts to defend  then guild hall when outnumbered or when you have the advantage not just when you have the  advantage and taking the fight sometimes to other players not just waiting on them to come to you   and those are my responses thanks for your consideration severance **symbio**Subj: new lawCc: (To: merto) hughDate: Aug 20 21:20Today a brand new CyberNinja created a vote where he/she wants to remove all guild positions.  I thought it was absurd so I squashed it until we could all have a discussion on the matter.  I created a new law stating that a CyberNinja needs to be in the guild for 30 days, and max beltlevels and chiplevels before he/she can create a vote that would effectively change the guild.   Does this sound unreasonable?  Also, I think that Jinichi may be on to something. I believe there should be term limits to Directive positions.  I also believe those term limits should be protected to some degree.  For example, I would propose 6 month term limits where the Directive could not be voted out of office, except with a...say...90% vote.  What are your thoughts?  -Symb **symbio**Subj: The lawCc: (To: recca) severance,merto,hughDate: Aug 21 17:55So I'm not sure if you received my mud mail, but I sent it to all of the officers so that we could discuss it.  I received a reply from Severance who basically said that's not how it is written in the help files, but he seemed to somewhat agree to it (please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not trying to put words in peoples mouths).  I haven't heard from anyone else.  I think it's an interesting topic.  Should someone who joined the guild THAT day create a vote to remove the entire guild ladder?  I see that as being extremely disrespectful.  They don't even know the guild yet, and they're already trying to usurp the ladder.  Also, I was very clear that I made that law effective immediately, but that we would collectively discuss the matter together, so that we could maybe come to a more sensible solution...one that we all agreed on.  I don't think what you posted was very smart Recca.  I think it was pretty rude.  I wasn't trying to be a dick.  I wasn't trying to be a dictator.  I was very open to discussing this issue with all of you and I made that very clear.  -Symb **"
