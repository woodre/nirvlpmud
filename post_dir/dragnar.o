The returns flatten out right at the same max point so it should be not an issue there. Not sure if I am gonna be able to look at the other ones but if I can I will try and get one done tonight. By the way I did not do any spam on the extra specials so that still needs to be done.  Bob. **sami**Subj: Teleport spellsCc: shinshiDate: Oct 27 16:13Some teleport spells like Mages tlp and elementalists teleport spell, does not seem to check for a no-teleport and can work inside of NO TP rooms. thanks **rumplemintz**Subj: LDDate: May  5 10:16I think I have this whole permissions thing figured out (not fixed!!)  With the stock 2.4.5 mudlib that comes with LDmud, everything works as planned.  I reverted some master/simul stuff back to that stock, and have narrowed the issue down to the resolv_path simul_efun.  That's where the path isn't getting calculated correctly, which adds the current path when it's not supposed to, adds a slash, etc....  We should just need to fix that simul_efun to work properly (or as expected) and our issues should go away.  **rumplemintz** Re:   SecurityCc: SecurityDate: Jul 13 09:56Interesting idea.  Server access would just require a user/pass on the server and not necessarily root access.  Could setup permissions for them to move files between the specific subdirectories that they should have access to  Linux security is way better than mud security, with the added benefit of forcing ssh access instead of telnet.  Would need to pass this by B  **rumplemintz** Re:   LD securityDate: Oct 22 13:17I'm guessing it's because cat() is now an sefun instead of an efun - so it's getting introduced into the stack.  I think we can get it to allow any obj/simul_efun call valid_write somewhere in master.c - if i remember correctly. **cloud**Subj: Login Bonus IdeaDate: Dec 23 20:59Daily login will award player 1-? points depending upon consecutive days. Room dedicated for login reward token cash-in 2000 points - Custom Item (work with a wiz to make a legal item) 1000 - Named Item (just rename an item you have to personlize) 500 - Personalized Emote (work with a wiz to have your own emote!) 250 - Auto-Load bag (sweet) 200 - Personalized Title  100 - Strength potion that lasts till you log off 50 - Double Exp potion that lasts till you log off 25 - Scratch off that give X amount of coins 10 - A single Full Heal  Just a few ideas I quickly came up with.  I am going to wrap myself! I shall return. **gizmo**Subj: DragonarmorCc: noneDate: Oct 24 07:04I know it use to do it. In the Cave of the Red Dragon, you were supposed to kill all the soldiers to get the dragonscales, then you could either exchange them to somebody for coin, or change them to Dragonplate Armor. That's the name of the armor I'm talking about. Erik has one in his clan lockers.  It's description read: This is a lightweight set of fullplate armor made from the scales of a red dragon. It is covered with shards of dragon teeth, offering offensive and well as considerable defensive potential.This armor is saveable.This armor is type armor. **worm**Subj: heyDate: Nov  5 12:48man.. i wanna play here again.. but wtf is up with Spinal? shardaks took serious kicks in the balls over 2 spells...  darkness and spinal ... now spinal isnt worth the pile of bones its cast on and i dont even wanna see whats been done to darkness.. and the fighting system.. well, whatever, ill get used to that i guess? men in graveyard are like wtf hard.. hope the xp got a million times better. ..... anyway, is there anything you can do to make spinal not such a lil slut that dies when a zombie farts? dies when a zombie farts? err. yeah. err. yeah. lol fml.. maybe im too damn old and set in the old ways. anyway. let me know. **"
