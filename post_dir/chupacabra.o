Nothing really severe or red-flaggish, aside from the radio controlled helicopters, used Ferrari 308, several hundred pounds of caviar, and this "Ducati Desmodromic" whatever the hell the thing is.  But call me, i need some resolution before granting the line of credit.  Oh yeah, the guild thing is clear so you're free to rejoin. But we really need to discuss finances and stuff. **katya** Re:   storageDate: Jul 20 15:23Aww.. that is so sweet! :) **mizan**Subj: Busted abusing a bugCc: simple,grudge,volkar,kosh,darque,ensco,redrum,mizan,earwaxDate: Aug  6 00:25I think i need to hear your side of the story on this.  -miz **"
