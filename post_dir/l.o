So I was looking around at the rangers who play, and they are the same people.  I was wondering if you could maybe boot the rangers who no longer play, because they just take up space in the guild, being only 50 people allowed to join.   Thank you for your time.  -blob**glaxgor**Subj: beta testerCc: (To: fred) lDate: Jul 28 17:22i wish to beta test for bloodfist i wish that you would allow me to beta test for you because i am a dried out warrior who is looking for a way to keep himself busy and i think bloodfist would be a good way for me to learn how to fight again**nameless**Subj: falsely acusedCc: (To: boltar) lDate: Sep  2 20:51boltar, i was jailed as fastkill and boomer today. it appears that mizan was under the impression that i was trying to give coins to fastkill from boomer. the truth of the matter is that there was a mistake with my trying to retrieve poppys equipment, and i dropped all that i had from my other char <coins> (boomer) once i found out that they were not poppys for i did not know weathre he quit, or died and well he seems to think that i was intentionaly cheating!. well doodle was there to back me up because it is all his fualt that it happend. i would like to talk to u about this for i believe my char was unjustly jailed. **l'**'**\**chett**Subj: ATMCc: (To: doodle) lDate: Sep  4 09:42No problem.

I reported the bug of not being able to offwield it, I told fred in person, he told me its the same bug crystal longsword hd, and ive seen crystal longsword being dual wielded. Therefore I "did" turn in the object. This is the last time ill be logging on until I find a second icy sword.   **morpheus**Subj: pleaseCc: (To: pestilence) lDate: Apr 11 08:54c'mon man pretty please ;) pretty please man c'mon have some pity on a poor boy ;)  **symbio**Subj: pk bug...Cc: (To: illarion) lDate: May  2 01:17I was told by an unknown source that the PK bug might lie in the Chestguard of Healing or Health or whatever, which was coded by Forbin.  I don't know how, but this is a credible source.  **amiro**Subj: ...Cc: (To: worm) lDate: May 23 00:37Dude, Sweetmisery was talking some mad fucking shit about me.

One of which is the soul gem.  Perhaps the soul gems could augment corpse usage, either healing when corpses are used or something like that.  Since they are lvl 3 gems, perhaps they could also heal sp or something like that. Since they are lvl 3 gems, perhaps they could also heal sp or something like that.  -Sid **reptile**Subj: leage of legends?Cc: (To: worm) lDate: Mar 29 23:59have you played league of legends? super fucking competitive. free to play. lots of variation.. most played online game in the world. get it. chett,reptile,thomas,wipeout,peanut pz  l **"
