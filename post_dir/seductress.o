In the case of suggesting that a sword have color added to its description, you would do: idea [sword] it would be nice if there was color added to this.  That way it gives the correct filename for the object, rather than for the room. :)  CC'ing this to Vertebraker with the entry itself as well, since he runs the guild, so it can be addressed.  Thanks for the report.  :)  -Earwax  Reports for: /players/vertebraker/guilds/mages/rooms/spell_masters  Aug 30 00:24 :: seductress    mhelp learning_spells should say something about needing to learn spells specifically from Spell Masters not just any Master, to be less confusing. . **"
