I'd like to clarrify where I stand, and give my side ofthe story.I'll start off by saying that I HATE the succubus mini-guild.  It is,as far as I know, the only part of the game where a player can affectanother player's character adversely, regardless of PK setting.  Yesthe sex command is dumb, and perhaps it is childish to be mad whenI lose the ability, but regardless, it is the truth.The other mini guild abilities can ALL be undone.  I point to thetie_laces command as an example.  However, there is no way to undothe command that lets a succubus remove a players balls, and ifthey don't choose to give them back to you, then you're screwedso to speak, until the next reboot.  That is, in my opinion, crap.I have no problem with them being able to cut them off, but the factthat they get posession is wrong.  It costs them 100 sps to do it,I think that if its been done, you should be able to undo it.Wolfsbane cut off my character's balls not too long ago.  I asked herrepeatedly to give them back.  I said she would regret it if she didn'tShe still refused.  And she did it a number of other times after that,once giving them to Icingdeath.So, I have called her names.  I have spit on her, and I have stolen kills.I plan to continue doing at least the latter.  However, some players seemto have taken offense at my calling her names, and have complained aboutit.  The only person I have called names has been Wolfsbane.  Anyone elsehas chosen to be an ass and stick their nose in business that is, quitefrankly, not theirs.My position is that if she walks in the room, and I choose tocall her a bitch, or spit on her, that's something between her and I.No other player BUT Wolfsbane has the right to complain about that andtell me to stop.  And I should NOT be threatened with jail if I don'twant to stop for one player or another (in reality, I think the"multiple" complaints are more likely coming from onecharacter's multiple characters.I've been good about keeping it off channels.  If asked to stop on any ofthem, I have.  But I don't think its right to demand I not call her a nameor spit on her when she walks into a room I'm in.  As far as I knowshe hasn't complained herself ONE TIME.  She has never asked me to stop.The only people who have told me to shut up or stop have been playersuninvolved in the argument, and they don't have any right or standing todo so.I'll finish by saying that if she asks me to stop the spitting and namecalling, then fine, I will.  I will also state for the record that, unlessthere is a rule against it, I do not plan on stopping the pet killing orcorpse stealing, which is perfectly legal.  But I don't feel I should have**denttle**Subj: ContinuedCc: (To: aingeal) puppy,earwax,francesco,dentDate: Apr 14 13:23which she has not.  Sorry for the length of this, but there was one morepoint I would like to make.  I think that this all could have been avoided by one of 3 changes to that damn mini guild:1.  Make the cut fixable, not permanent.  MAybe the clinic could do this?2.  When someone cuts off your balls, they should stay in your inventory.3.  Remove the ability for it to be done on a non-PK, or for a non-PKto do it.  It violates the spirit of not being PK.  Everythingelse that can be done to a player is classified as a minor annoyance;this is the only thing (that I can think of) that actually can "harm a player".That's just my two cents, from someone who has been here a LONG time.*lick*Dent(tle)**"
