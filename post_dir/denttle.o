messages "aingeal** Re:   ContinuedDate: Apr 14 15:03Dent(tle),I understand why you must be annoyed.  However, this is the first I have heardof this situation (i.e. Wolfsbane has not complained to me about your behavior),so you've taken me a bit by surprise.  Who threatened you with jail over this?I do not have the authority to change the code on the Succubus miniguild withouttalking to Boltar about this, and given the relatively minor effect this has on players,he may not wish to make any changes.  I will, however, ask him about it andshare your concerns and suggestions with him.  In the meantime, as you accuratelystated, pet killing and kill stealing are absolutely not a violation of any rule, andif Wolfsbane continues to hastle you by cutting your balls off, there is no reasonwhy you should not continue to kill her pets and steal her kills.  I would be a bitmore careful with the name-calling and spitting, although it is NOT a violation of any rule to do so, so long as you do not do it continuously in the face of a clearrequest from Wolfsbane to stop (again, there is no suggestion that you've doneany of that, or anything wrong at all).  In short, please let me know who threatened you with jail over this, and whatthe circumstances were, and I will mention your suggestions to Boltar to seeif he wants me to modify the code a bit so that the effects of that guild commandare more temporary.  Additionally, I understand that Earwax has chatted with all of you, and that hopefully his warnings to all of you will resolve any issues between youand Wolfsbane.  Please let me know if any similar problems arise.Thanks!Aingeal**"
