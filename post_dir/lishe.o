I want to say yes, cause he was active, did alot of cool things that the players really enjoyed.  But I want to say no too cause he left, and weather he was one of the ones who removed code from here to start a new mud or just accepted that it happened, i dont know but either way it doesnt seem right to me.  hold on..let me flip a coin... heh just kidding..i guess since we are trying to get player base reestablished, and get this mud back to its heyday of popularity another quality active wizard would be a good idea.  I just dont think he should advance past level 40 for a long time..until he proves himself again...should he come back to his senior wiz status..i say no to that...but yes to his return.  Trist. **earwax**Subj: Armor shitCc: (To: zeus) wocket,feldegast,pain,jaraxle,eurale,beck,jenny,pestilence,puppy,wren,martha,gemini,angel,jamila,catt,star,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,mokri,sparrow,rumplemintz,aquila,lacar,quicksilver,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,catacomb,hair,veeshan,haywire,skie,sampson,y,chax,lisheDate: Mar 29 02:39I'd like you all to give me some feedback on this shit, just send me a reply to it....basically it involves a HUGE fundamental change to the mud, but one long overdue, i (and many players and wizzes) feel.  Basically, instead of all guilds, all players, using same gear  essentially, and everything being max ac, weight 1, with specials,  this will create a lot of diversity, especially considering that the guilds can be made to utilize the changes very easily.  The file to look at is /open/earwax/armor.txt  Just send a reply, not reply all, or post, I'll be sharing all feedback with the other admins and whatnot.  This is a major deal, so please send your feedback.  -earwax **"
