I'm glad that you've been inspired to code a guild. Just so you know, I am not considered one of the more technically hardcore coders on here. My role is more like the ISP for the game, and I try to keep my hands off many issues. Helping new wizards however is one of those things that I like to do however.  Typically I do not handle the vetting process for new wizards- that's something that either Boltar does or is done in a collective with other wizzes. In the past I usually didn't get directly involved so I simply don't know how that works. The truth is I don't know what to do from this point on so I will involve other wizards.  That having been said, what I do know about coding of guilds and realms is that it is always better to start off coding a realm first. I don't  mean this to discourage you, because it's almost never the technical issues of a guild that are daunting- but guilds require intimate experience with the object libraries (sort of like APIs) that coding a realm does not. I speak from experience in this regard.  Since you have previous programming experience, the transition to LPC should be fairly straightforward. It is a mostly object oriented environment with a simplified C-like language syntax. However the object libraries and APIs were constructed in a very organic manner, so imagine an environment that has mixtures of programming philosophy and is generally not documented very well, or at all.  My recommendation is to come up with a realm idea first and develop that into a solid proposal. With a good area in place, a guild tends to become the next logical step and has a strong platform to build on. Also, the process of building an area also grants familiarity with what is legal in the game, and what sort of things might or might not fly. Anyhow, take this with a huge grain of salt, as it is subjectively my experience on this.  I will talk with Boltar and other wizzes, so stay tuned. Thanks! -miz/ aka Tijger **marek**Subj: note to knightsDate: Jul 12 22:26My dear brethren,   Upon many days of thought, I have drawn to the conclusion that, in order to deal with the mage problem and the ongoing problem of evil that has infested our lands in the knights absence, we need to  open the castle so that they may come too us.  Within the castle walls we are able to cast the spell Holy ground, this spell is very powerful in that it doesn't allow anyone in the room to cast spells.  This would cripple a mage, or multiple mages in which I'm expecting.  I will be on regularly to safeguard the castle so no one needs worry, you will not be alone.  Opening the castle does have some potential lethal consequences; one is that the entire castle is a pk zone, that means intruders can kill you so idling in at the board or anywhere wouldn't be a good idea.  I might mention Fred to make the garden area non pk, since this area is a very peaceful area. My suggestion is, idle in your rooms. We will have the Templar Guards roaming around, which are VERY tough to kill, and deal mass amounts of damage.  Also, being a lieutenant I will have the ability to toggle our status to WAR, and close the castle gate, which takes time for our intruders to kill before entering, also I may fortify the gatehouse with more troops.  Times are tough my brethren, we must look to the future of this realm with our swords drawn and shields held high. For  those of you in favor of opening the Castle, mail fred asap saying Yay! If for some reason you wish not to open the Castle, mail fred asap saying Nay!  It is an honor to serve you, and I look forward to defeating the evil from this realm once and for all.    In your service,  Sir Marek, Knight of the Pandion Order **worm**Subj: Black Gold OnlineCc: (To: wipeout) chett,symbio,mode,wicket,tristian,wipeout,xiao,deathseeker,equilibriumDate: Jul 26 15:03it's free.. and a pvpers paradise end game. mechs vs nature.. i wanted to go mech, but every other douche out there does as well.. leaving the nature fuckers out matched. so.. i joined Lokemon server, Nature.  come kick some ass with me **"
