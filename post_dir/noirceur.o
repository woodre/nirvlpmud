I just wanted to extend greetings to the most recent vampires to have logged and ask that you consider letting me into your family. Aside from the '1' typo at the beginning of my post I feel it is a good post. Let me know if you have any questions or requests of me. **charm**Subj: long timeDate: Oct 16 15:22been a long time since i've seen you...i see you logged on about 5 minutes before I did today.. **"
