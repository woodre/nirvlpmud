I guess what it  boils down to is the vision for how ninja are supposed to be ran is that the directive sets down hey, thou shalt not kill pets/kids/do whatever, via input from voting system and officer input.  The executor and enforcers are to enforce it - dishonorings, etc.  The intellect should probably be figuring out what changes need to be occurring, and be setting up votes, getting input from other ninja, etc.    What I'm basically saying, is you're the directive, direct!   Heh :)  From a code end, I'm not really sure what my options are, I mean, I COULD make it no-kid/no-pet (except for mechs of course), but then what happens with ninja dogs, ninja kids, what about renegades, where do the kids and pets go, yadda yadda.  Frankly I also think that if you enter into ninja ghall with the kids/pets they are fair game. In a perfect world, they'd kill the intruder instead, but we both  know that's not how these things typically work.  Another thought I have had - unrelated actually, to this - If you're fighting a ninja guild mob, then perhaps a minor 'stun' could be in place, a beefing of the mobs themselves, and low exp of course.  I haven't put too much thought into this, but I've had that floating around in my head.  **pike**Subj: HadusCc: DoodleDate: Apr 21 13:26I read your log.  I don't have any specific problem with him getting into hotel rooms and taking coinage, at least of knights.  I do have a problem with him stealing gear.  We have no need for gear.  I have been a ninja for many years now and have in my opinion served this guild's best interests. I also know my role as an enforcer, so I always look to our leaders for their direction.  If this is something to not be tolerated, let us enforcers know and it will be dealt with.  When you report incidents to me let me know if you want to take action.  I have killed with/near hadus very little, but he has, to me, shown an aggressive pk stance.  I cannot and do not vouche for his lack of respect or shady dealings.  Enforcers have limited power, we can basically only report to you two and dishonor.  Mail be back with your direction, I need to know the exact will of the ninja leaders in order to be an effective enforcer.   I did get a tell from Gogeta the other day when Hadus and I were trying to infiltrate the knight castle.  Gogeta informed me that Hadus quit out of a fight inside the castle.  I asked Hadus and he said he was not in combat when he quit.  I'm going to take a fellow ninja's word over a knight ally's word any day. Just the same It made me weary of Hadus's truthfullness.   I will keep both eyes open. --Pike **korwrath** Re:   hadusCc: doodle,earwax,pike,mokriDate: Apr 22 13:05I agree.  Total lack of respect, and his overtly obivous shardak traits mark him out as no better then a 'gade.  His clic is trying to grab as much power as they can, and by self fluffing themselves up they believe that they are right.  If this continues they all should be dishhonored  greatly.  Also having a non ninja go ballistic on the star channel just on the topic of this whole thing is pathetic.  Granted I am not a great pk or a enforce or other mighty officer, I do what I can, and dispense what wisdom I can when asked or the need arises.  -Korwrath the Intellect **shinshi**Subj: beta testingCc: shinshiDate: Jan  9 10:00Would live  bah sorry.. on phone. would love to have ya pk has to be set at all times no pking while in beta though unfortunately let me know when you're gonna be on, and I'll add ya **shinshi**Subj: poison wearing offDate: Jan 12 22:50it does give you a notification when it wears off ;) **"
