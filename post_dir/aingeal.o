However i would like to point out a few things... First off is that so long as my snoop objects were autoloading, i was snooping myself. I figured it was the least i could do to add a check and balance to the system. Eating my own dogfood, so to speak.  Secondly, that the sheer majority of cheating that has been observed is of a small group of repeat offenders. I think it is very rare indeed when a newbie/stranger comes on here and performs deliberate cheating.  That having been said, i shut down all snooping. I'm not even going to log people like worm (entreri@elysium) because quite frankly, he has nothing interesting to say/threaten about here anyhow.  Also i realize that for the greater good of the mud things need to change, but this whole issue about privacy being sacred is just in my opinion overblown. We would be fooling ourselves if we wanted to spread the message that this place is a safe, viable chat alternative. Raw telnet packets going over the air unencrypted- it would simply be irresponsible of us to promote that as a safe system to communicate with others. Now i realize that most IM protocols are also wide open. But i also realize that trying to spread a message to players that this is a safe place where wizzes will not just randomly snoop people for their amusement- I am totally in agreement with that part. 100 percent. So long as we are aware of the differences in these two issues i think things will be okay. Well, that's all i have to say for now, and that managing some of the perceptions to players (while i may not agree with the basis of many of them) is important, and i'm willing to adapt along.  Thanks for your time, -miz **mizan**Subj: You are a grieferCc: (To: hawkman) whitehawk,mizan,boltar,fred,x,star,illarion,sparrow,khrell,shinshi,aingeal,angel,captpotatoDate: Aug 10 22:44You quit out of the game while I was trying to diagnose an issue for you, but not before launching a diatribe about morals and other bullshit. This was your last tell:  22:35:04 Hawkman tells you: my point is its not right and it shows someone is messing with things they shouldnt be  Can you prove this? I am not messing with you because quite frankly you are not worth the time for me to mess with. I do not mess with people like you because there is frankly no real motivation to do so. It is not rewarding, and the fact that you whine about anything and everything makes it rather annoying on top of it all. For the record, while you were pestering me with tells, I was busy, preparing the new server which will replace the current machine that this game runs on. I don't appreciate your sass and as a directive to anyone else who cares to listen, I will only say this: Everyone, please ignore Whitehawk and any of his characters unless you are prepared to devote ALL and EVERY IOTA of  attention to his well being, his desires, and all of his general wants. Which for most of us (since we are not paid and do this for the fun of it)... will be NEVER.  There is no wizard conspiracy against you, because I will speak for many if not all- We consider your whining presence simply not worth the effort. We have other things to conspire about, such as what to do with Jimmy Hoffa's entombed corpse in Giants Stadium when the facility is scheduled for demolition. It's really a fucking pain in the ass because while ALL of us were present when his tattered, bloated corpse was dumped unceremoniously into the cement- none of us are sure of EXACTLY where he is buried.  SO PLEASE forgive us if we dont respond right away to your princely presence (within 2 seconds) because right now the loss of Hoffa's exact location is fucking Khrell's fault, and he still hasn't paid me back for those beers.  Yours sarcastically, Captain Assjesus **mizan**Subj: Delorean griefing on channels, and stuff.Cc: (To: boltar) illarion,rumplemintz,aingeal,khrell,star,x,pain,tristian,keeper,artos,valen,angel,worm,shinshi,sparrow,forbin,guestDate: Sep  8 21:17Hi guys, I heard about some of the stuff Delorean was spewing on channels, and wanted just to give my take on things. I don't really care about what he does or says, and I have encouraged other wizzes not to provoke him by even responding to anything he has to say. Yes. That is my official stance. Just flat out ignore him no matter how irritating his words may be. Don't bother him, don't help him, don't hinder him, just ignore him completely. But let him speak.  I know it sounds counter-intuitive but I encourage you to do the same, and even spread the word about it to others if possible. Delorean may be a griefer and a selfish little twit, but he has a right to login to this game and play.  In the past I have not been as saintly and approachable either, and I recognize that. In the past I have done things like delete his characters or siteban him and it has not changed his behavior. When I returned to here a few months ago,  I made an offer to start off with him on a clean slate. I believe I have held my end of the bargain. However he has chosen not to. But I'm cool with that.  Rather than wipe him off the MUD i chose a different vent for dealing with him. I made a comic which features some of his antics, of which there are two episodes so far visible at:  http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/a-barycentric-griefing-motion/ and http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/the-third-fastest-thing-in-the-world/  Again, I encourage others to simply ignore him, and let peace and contentedness be in your soul rather than pure rage that (insertDeityHere) has forsaken us and left us such a miserable little shitfucker to suffer with. Delorean and his kind are a vital part of this MUD's ecosystem, as we need diversity... strong PK'ers, roleplayers, socialites, coders, whining douchebags- We need them all.  There is a saying in Arabic which does not translate well, but I'll try- "I let my enemies dine at my doorstep because it is my pleasure, God willing." So paraphrased my take on that is: "I let Delorean play here and speak what he wants because it is my pleasure."  So you know what to do. The next stupid thing he does, mudmail me a transcript and I will credit you appropriately on my next comic strip(s).  Thank you for reading. -Miz **star**Subj: area standardsCc: (To: angel) sparrow,rumplemintz,mizan,aingealDate: Sep 10 19:54I had already typed up a file for my own use on what I expect, and  sent the file path to Angel to let him weigh in on it.  I haven't  heard back from him yet, and I'd be happy to get any input from  anyone else as well.  What I typed up is based on what I was taught  and is the way I prefer to do it.  If anyone disagrees with anything  in it, feel free to argue, but I think it's all pretty logical.  At  this point it was just meant to be for me, and for the people I was  approving, so it's written with things like "me" and "I", but if we  all get together on it, it can of course be re-written.  The idea to  make it standard for all stuff was brought up after I had started  writing..  shrug.   Anyway, the file path for now is /open/star/approvals.guide If anyone has anything to add, argue, suggest, or otherwise chat about let me know.  I guess we could keep replying this way, or we could add comments to another file in someone's open..  Or, and here's a fun concept, we could all figure out how to do it on the Wiki..  *8)  -Star **"
