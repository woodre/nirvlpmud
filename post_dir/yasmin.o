I'm watching the news.  Beaker **beaker**Subj: Whenever you get thisCc: beakerDate: Apr  6 18:00Hi.  Whenever you get this, please log in and have some fun so I can get the reward for referring you here.  You have to actually play here for a while so I can get whatever the prize is, for getting u setup here. Besides I still have some stuff for you.  Thank You,  Beaker **beaker**Subj: disregard previous emailsCc: beakerDate: May  6 16:53Hi.  I had the strangest thing happen while playing a secondary character. A newbie asked me my real age on this thing so I told her.  She said that wasn't very young.  So I asled her if she was even old enough to vote. That got her attention and she left me alone.  A kid being really persistent on a mud.  I don't know if that is being safe or just plain annoying. Anyway, I'm just hanging out not doing very much and would appreciate it if you'd come on and hang out too, when u have the time.  Thanks, Beaker **oreo**Subj: GreetingsCc: oreoDate: May  7 20:02Hello, fellow Chroptim.

If you need something ask Salina if she is on. She's a newbie helper and will be happy to help out.  As for me,  I am off to bed.  It's really late and I've been on here since 12 noon my time, just hanging out.  Was feeling really down earlier, but have pulled myself together.  Send me an email (regular) and we'll try to get together another time.  Good night,  Beaker **"
