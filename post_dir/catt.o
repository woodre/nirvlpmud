It was in sorely bad taste and was probably done on some late night years ago ...  In any case, if you ARE interested in working here, I'd like to get you more involved. We are changing the MUD a lot, and while your stuff is dated, a lot of is quite excellent.  **vertebraker**Subj: maledictaCc: (To: angel) beck,catt,earwax,eurale,fakir,feldegast,forbin,francesco,fred,gemini,illarion,jamila,jara,jaraxle,jenny,khrell,lacar,linus,lishe,martha,mokri,mosobp,pain,pavlik,pestilence,sampson,skie,sparkle,star,stardream,subotai,tristian,veeshan,vital,wocket,wren,zeusDate: Oct 31 15:44   Maledicta [the wizard] wishes to return to Nirvana.   Please mail a vote [yes/no] and your comment to Vertebraker **tristian** Re:   maledictaCc: (To: vertebraker) angel,beck,catt,earwax,eurale,fakir,feldegast,forbin,francesco,fred,gemini,illarion,jamila,jara,jaraxle,jenny,khrell,lacar,linus,lishe,martha,mokri,mosobp,pain,pavlik,pestilence,sampson,skie,sparkle,star,stardream,subotai,tristian,veeshan,vital,wocket,wren,zeusDate: Nov  2 08:08I am torn on my response to this. I want to say yes, cause he was active, did alot of cool things that the players really enjoyed.  But I want to say no too cause he left, and weather he was one of the ones who removed code from here to start a new mud or just accepted that it happened, i dont know but either way it doesnt seem right to me.  hold on..let me flip a coin... heh just kidding..i guess since we are trying to get player base reestablished, and get this mud back to its heyday of popularity another quality active wizard would be a good idea.  I just dont think he should advance past level 40 for a long time..until he proves himself again...should he come back to his senior wiz status..i say no to that...but yes to his return.  Trist. **vertebraker** Re:   My main areaDate: Nov  4 17:35yah, no problem. let me know if you need help with it.  if you haven't already, please post a news message. [Actually, I'll take care of this one.]   the steps:  clone /open/NEWS/poster  type 'post'  select the group, follow the instros.  :) **vertebraker**Subj: fakirDate: Nov  5 22:27did Fakir do something that pissed you off? Let's talk about it.   Tom **vertebraker** Re:   Fakir - YesDate: Nov 15 02:17i'm back and i'll take a look at the files : )  hang tough with us, we're still learning  tom  [email me anytime, tmieczkowski@gmail.com] **vertebraker**Subj: re: fakirDate: Nov 15 16:54thanks.  the admin is discussing the policy. **vertebraker**Subj: fakirDate: Nov 18 23:15do you have a log of what fakir said to you? i'm sure you don't, but i'd ask. lol :) or remember any specifics? need to have a chat with him.   thanks,  tom [tmieczkowski@gmail.com] **earwax**Subj: Armor shitCc: (To: zeus) wocket,feldegast,pain,jaraxle,eurale,beck,jenny,pestilence,puppy,wren,martha,gemini,angel,jamila,catt,star,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,mokri,sparrow,rumplemintz,aquila,lacar,quicksilver,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,catacomb,hair,veeshan,haywire,skie,sampson,y,chax,lisheDate: Mar 29 02:39I'd like you all to give me some feedback on this shit, just send me a reply to it....basically it involves a HUGE fundamental change to the mud, but one long overdue, i (and many players and wizzes) feel.  Basically, instead of all guilds, all players, using same gear  essentially, and everything being max ac, weight 1, with specials,  this will create a lot of diversity, especially considering that the guilds can be made to utilize the changes very easily.  The file to look at is /open/earwax/armor.txt  Just send a reply, not reply all, or post, I'll be sharing all feedback with the other admins and whatnot.  This is a major deal, so please send your feedback.  -earwax **earwax** Re:   Armor shitDate: May  6 05:36any questions feel free to mail me I'm really glad to see you on, especially since soon, (i hope) we  (meaning me) can do these armor changes, and combined with attribs, races, and skills, actually get assassins back in the game.  When THAT happens I expect to see you on heh, if not before, to put your area back in the game :)  -Dave **earwax**Subj: ldmudCc: (To: forbin) francesco,fakir,pavlik,stardream,jenny,pain,zeus,wocket,feldegast,vital,jaraxle,eurale,khrell,pestilence,puppy,star,wren,angel,martha,gemini,jamila,catt,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,aquila,kain,lacar,brittany,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,airwoman,catacomb,veeshan,haji,hair,skie,chip,sampson,chax,y,atipode,lisheDate: Oct  6 07:22I need to see work on this project.  I've been asking for it for months, but I haven't seen anything.  Yesterday, I recommended automatic dewizzing of all wizards not involved, so I'm trying to prevent this because it WILL happen otherwise.  In other words, I'm trying to see work done, so this doesn't happen, although if it doesn't I'm the  one to blame and the first to take the blame, because I fully intend to dewiz every single individual that does not get involved.  I have the position, I have the power, and i'm using it, is the bottom line.  If you want to keep your wizard get involved with this.  It's seriously the most important project in the last 15 years.  -david (dhalek@comcast.net) **fakir**Subj: dewizzingCc: (To: boltar) francesco,pavlik,stardream,jenny,pain,zeus,wocket,feldegast,vital,jaraxle,eurale,khrell,pestilence,puppy,star,wren,angel,martha,gemini,jamila,catt,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,aquila,kain,lacar,brittany,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,airwoman,catacomb,veehsan,haji,hair,skie,chip,sampson,vertebraker,xDate: Oct  7 19:16I guess you know what your doing with an ego enlarged, self indulgent, puffed up with power wizard like Earwax in charge of the mud. If you wish to know what I am talking about, read some of the mails he has sent me.  Personally, I like the mud the way it is. I don't want to change it. I have no intention of dancing to some tune Earwax feels like playing on his flute. I do not, nor never have abused wizard powers. I occasionally snoop a player, but never when two players are in a room or chatting. And, I usually (almost always) tell a player if and when I am snooping them and also when I turn snoop off.  Its absurd that Earwax even brings that into a conversation about being a wizard.   Personally Boltar, I am sick and tired of his heavy handed way of dealing with things...and it's my opinion you are going to have a dead mud very soon because of it.  I will not tolerate someone who threatens, cajoles, and is otherwise a dick.   It is true I do not contribute to the mud much, other than the areas I did code and are in play.  However, I have never seen my contribution here to be one of code.  Wizards come and go...power hungry, unstable wizards have come and gone.  In almost every case where there has been an abuse of power, or a lack of good judgement, I have had a hand in resolving that issue...in some way or another.  And, I might add, you have usually backed me up in most of the disputes I have had some involvement in.  I don't really care what Earwax does. I do not have the juice, nor the time, nor really the interest anymore to try and corral his over-bloated ego...I suspect that issue, if its dealt with, will have to rest with you. apply sphere to being a wizard here...I've had a good run. I have enjoyed the game, and enjoyed for the most part the people I have met here.  If the current gestapo Earwax does indeed have his way and dewizes me, so be it.  Even though he feels otherwise, I still think I contribute something to the game...but as always, I will leave that up to you to decide. I am way too old and way to long in the tooth here to care much what some bully wizard dictates to me as being 'his way or the highway'.  Do you really want someone like this in charge of things to the point you give him THAT much authority?  Vert NEVER had an ego like Earwax. He NEVER abused any wizard power. He never, once he became a wizard, cheated the game. I cannot say the same for Earwax.  There is a WORLD of difference between Vertebraker and Earwax as far as Admin goes.  Personally, if Earwax is in charge, I don't want to be a wizard here. * **boltar** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) earwax,francesco,pavlik,stardream,jenny,pain,zeus,wocket,feldegast,vital,jaraxle,eurale,khrell,pestilence,puppy,star,wren,angel,martha,gemini,jamila,catt,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,aquila,kain,lacar,brittany,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,airwoman,catacomb,veehsan,haji,hair,skie,chip,sampson,vertebraker,xDate: Oct  8 21:41  How do we lose players/wizards?   1) personality conflicts, gossip, social bullshit.  2) bored because of a lack of new challenges.   That's it in a nutshell. I take responsibility for not being socially  good enough myself to keep a peace and get people to work good enough  together. but the fact remains that unless we complete some serious  rennovations the mud will just slide into obscurity.   Since there is no one else to do it. All conflicts between wizards  will be resolved by me. Odds are everyone involved will hate my solutions so I advise living and let live as much as possible and don't do things that you know are going to result in conflict or displine or even questionable if you're seen/caught doing them.   I need productive people right now, not squabbles. Everyone needs to add something positive. I can't have people that just exist to cause conflict because they find it entertaining to do so. I don't need people getting pissed off at every little thing. What the mud needs, what I need for the mud are productive people.  It's that simple. And before there is any more squabbling, ask yourself where you(individuals) are on that, and that is the squabbling going to  lead to anything positive or just piss people off so we get even more  short handed?   I'll leave it at that.   -Bp  **"
