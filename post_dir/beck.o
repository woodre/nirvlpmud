And at theend of the forest a little dark path that leads by an openingin a mountain leading to a cave... inside that cave is a familyof dragons.   Armor being a main armor of dragon scales, a helmet made of a dragon skull.. Also have a good weapon in the area, a dragons tooth.. The cave I would like to put it so that anyone under level 10 are not allowed in therebecause I wanted it to be a bit harder and since it is at the end of a newbie area it would be best to have a restrictionon it.Also, the second area that I have made that I just need to changeover a piece at a time.. Is a theater...basically there is a ticket holder at the entrance and you have to purchase a ticket to enterthe theater.. Once you are in, you would be able to roam aroundand I have it so that when they go into the different movie roomsthat they can go to the screen and touch screen' and be transportedinto that scene of the movie, and kill in it.  As of right now I have threedifferent movies.. Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Snow White, Goonies, Princess Bride, and Stand by Me.  This area would be a mid level area.I also have an idea of a guild, I like dragons, and not sure if it is rightfor nirvana or not, but like a dragons guild, where the players are reborninto dragons after being adopted into the guild by another player..I just really enjoy coding and have wanted to code for Nirvana for a while.Well, if you would like anymore information please let me know.Thank you,Katya**hercules**Subj: Help pleaseDate: Mar 25 19:16Hi B.1. what's going on with us ?

I think we may need to rethink that. (unless there is code I am unaware of).Here is what I recommend:To recruit a new ranger, you must have Leadership 15, Morph 70, Combat 100, Team 5.This would mean you must be a Space Ranger, Black 8, with some team skills, and the necessary leadership skill points.I feel this would help us so that we do not get people that do not yet understand our way of battle, or that are not necessarily capable of assisting a new recruit from recruiting.  By acquiring the above mentioned skills, I believe a ranger would be knowlable enough to recruit and explain in detail many of our skills/philosophies.Just a thought, lemme know what ya think,Little (MAMMOTH)P.S.

This is something that I have wanted for a long time, but real life took me away for a while. Now I am back and looking to put some of the ideas I have to use here in Nirvana.I have not spoken to any of you regarding sponsorship and/or approval but I would really like it if you would consider doing one of those for me. I have not coded before.. but I have so many ideas and I know that I could learn to do so. Just takes some working at it and I have the time for that. =)I have played Nirvana for several years now and do not believe I am known as one who would stir up trouble and such. So you would not have to worry about me doing as others in the past and causing you problems.Anyway, please, if you can consider allowing me to become a wizard and can help me out with sponsorship and/or approval, look me up. I am here often and would love to answer any questions you might have for me.Thank you,Sparkle**forbin**Subj: Re-Wizing ApprovalDate: Jul  7 06:59Beck,I have recently spoken with Boltar about myself returning to Nirvana and becoming a wizard again. I left Nirvana during the new mud debacle, and also coded there. I am notproud of this, as I know I disrespected both Boltar and Nirvana, and showed a great lack of respect to the playersof the mud, which neither Boltar nor the players deserved. Earlier this week, I explained to Boltar how sorry I wasabout this. Though I coded there, it has been about 5 months since I been there. I believe I was led into some untruths, and also told partial truths. I listened to people I shouldn't have - and I did a stupid thing by leaving. I haven't a desire to code on that mud. I do however have a desire to be a wizard here. Even through all this, Nirvana still feels like home and has been greatly missed by me. I know that I will probably never be a senior wizard hereagain, nor will I ever gain the level of trust that thecollective wizardship had for me in the past, but I do knowthat I can be a productive wizard on Nirvana. I'd like tomake ammends and atone for the way I left Nirvana. I'd like to code areas that the players can enjoy.That being said, Boltar said he probably wouldn't have a problem with me re-wizing here, as long as I got some approvals and found a sponsor. I know how to code, and Iknow most of the rules here - I'll of course need a refresher, but I could be creating almost immediately.I know it is asking a lot to put your faith in someone that left in the manner I did, but I promise that I will do my best and never again betray the mud. I will work hard on improving my area and making fun here on Nirvana.If you could find it in your heart to approve me for becominga wizard again on Nirvana, I would appreciate it from the depths of my soul. I would not let you down.Thank you for your time, I look forward to speaking with youabout this.Forbin**hercules**Subj: powerDate: Jul  8 08:10Hi B,I was wondering what should we do so u will release the limit on the collectors ?do we need to build another shield ? or something else ?Yours,Hercules G Ranger**rykus**Subj: Training MobsDate: Jul 20 09:45Just to let you know...One player can go in and wipe out ALL of our training mobs in like 2 minutes.Not only do they not repop (morhei), but billy, tommy ect.., drain our guild power.

ThanksNotta the Maroon Ranger**tricie**Subj: Healers as AlliesDate: Sep 11 21:42Whitewolf told us tonight that you're considering removing themall, and when she said it, most of the guild erupted.  Sundinis threatening to leave, and others likely will as well.  Peoplesee him, and the other higher rangers, and that's when theywant to join.  What it comes down to is that most of us understandthat healers heal everyone and value all life, and that theyget very little exp for each heal, and take what they can get.There are two people in the guild who had a problem with it, andthough I'm rather new and may not be well informed on it all, itseems to me that those two don't do much as far as teamwork tohelp us all anyway.  Or at least very rarely from what I've seen.So they want them out, but all the rest of us want them in andunderstand that they do what they need to do.  Please considerallowing them to stay.  Sundin is dead serious about leaving,and he is a great asset to the guild.  And I'm sure he's rightthat others will as well, and likely the ones we need the most.Tricie the Turqoise Ranger**skan** Re:   ranger objectDate: Sep 12 17:53I have been on a bunch of times and never received the new object.

Just a heads up on what appears to be a well knownplayer bug. The creature Moe located in: /players/gowron/room/moesstill has some kind of error that kicks in with its heartbeat.The players can then pound the hell out of it once the heartbeatis lost and get a relatively easy kill out of it. Apparently themob is worth a good amount of reward.In either case, Humble tipped me off that someone was abusing thebug. I got to see it firsthand, and questioned the person abusing it(Zeek). I imprisoned Zeek (but otherwise didn't harm his character)because he lied to me about not having exploited this bug before.It's your call, i have no objections freeing Zeek in a bit becausehe had the pants scared off him after i figured out what his secondswere, what his favorite weapons, and attack monsters were, etc.There were no traces in the /debug.log so i have no idea what causedthe monster to lose its heartbeat. I have not made any changes tothe monster's environment, so the problem is still in effect.Thanks,-m**kezef**Subj: MoveDate: Oct 11 03:17I would like to move 10 out of machine5 will go to team and 5 to weapon then i'll start to work on morph again or leadership not sure which yet**telina**Subj: Guild IssuesCc: ghost,telinaDate: Oct 13 04:18Hello Beck & Ghost,I am writing this to you regarding an issue which came up today. I would like to explain my side to you so that you know what is going on.I posted a note about allies. Being as I do not quite understand the requirement for recruitment and etc. Once I logged on today, I found that I had 2 responses to my note and I read them both, very glad to see that someone responded and attempted to answer my questions. I replied again with answers to what I was asked in their notes.After doing so, Kezef and Whitewolf logged on. I was literally ripped apart by Kezef. Told that I am a bad Ranger. That I like to cause strife and that he should get me kicked out of rangers since he doesnt like me. Understand that his problems with me have nothing to do with the guild, but with real life issues. I asked that he keep his rl feelings about me off of the guild channel and the game.I was told that my opinion did not matter moreless and that I was only saying something because I have a personal problem with Halo. I am not sure how that is since I have no clue who Halo is outside of that character. And it is that character I have a problem with. I do not feel that healers who sit on the green and scream for people to go and get hurt so they can get xp or constantly beg for coins should be recruited as allies. We are not just here as moneybags or xphunters for them.I did state that I felt they have a right to their opinion as we all do. And that all I asked were simple questions on the globe and he had responded, it should be dropped. But instead I was torn apart by him and it turned into a personal attack. He has been reported for harassment previously by me. You can speak to Aingeal about that if need be. She can confirm that I reported him. I do not feel he had any right to use the ranger channel to do this. And I do not feel that being I was speaking incharacter about this situation, he should have brought out his rl feelings about me.I hope you can understand where I am coming from. I am not a bad Ranger. I play hard. And I do not like to cause strife.. but if me asking simple questions because I did not understand something.. comes across as causing strife to the guild, then I will step away from the guild. If that is the case, it is not a guild I want to be part of. Hopefully, this is not the case because I truly enjoy this guild and want it to be the best.Please let me know if I have stepped out of line.. or what I need to do about this situation. I will not tolerate his harassment in any form and I will be reporting the incident to Aingeal, just as before. I hope that we can resolve this without causing too many problems, but I truly do not feel I was out of line for my original post.

I know tons of great candidates for the alliance but they cannot join because they are dervish, fallen, symbiotes, etc.  I think Dark Order and Cyberninjas are out of the question, i'm not too keen on vampires but many believe that they aren't inheritently evil. Anyways main point of this letterI would really like to see the alliance borders changed or extended, I think that bards are more dependant upon us and knights then they are helping and they automatically get in.

But I was mistaken.  I started to loose myheart beat and even had my equipment fail to drop when I would logthe gear would simply vanish.  Well Vital was around that time andhe looked into it being one of the few seniors that can navagatethe code with some skill and not screw things up.  Well he told methat the guild roster was not updating properly and that could be the problem I was experiencing.  He tried to change my color to something that would tide me over until he could correct the problemI assume.  I'm no coding genius so I doubt I could alter my color,nor would I even if I knew how to, as this is not my guild and Irather enjoy playin git and don't want to be kicked out for somethingas silly as color changing.

There were several problems withhow you set it up that violated the established policies forcoders on Nirvana. The original workroom was either directlyor indirectly aimed at extending your command set beyond thegroup of commands indicated for a level 21 coder.This is your warning.

I would like to request that the rule of conduct be modified and changes to were no power ranger is allowed to party with an evil guild. Cyberninjas, Shardaks, Vampires, Dark Orders, etc.Please take your time and overlook this carefully. In the conduct, I know that there IS something about this is a 'good' guild so we should not be partying with evil guilds. Yet some have. Thank you for your time!Power Ranger Team Leader Viper the Almond Ranger**vital**Subj: Allies/PartiesCc: (To: viper) vital,beckDate: Jun 13 12:01Just a couple of thoughts before I even think about this.1.  I am NOT the Power Ranger guild wizard.2.  I only offer to help players as I would anytime there is an issue that involves a problem.3.  Perhaps I have been to 'helpful' to Rangers in the past, but I do have an affinity for the guild as it has been a big part of my time on Nirvana.Now, moving forward.1.  Power Rangers aren't in any alliance. Individual members can join alliances as they see fit. The guild itself is not involved in any guild-guild relationships.2.  That said, anytime a relationship outside of the guild conflicts with the guild, the guild takes precedence. I.e. Leave a party that attacks the Ranger npcs; Stop associating with pet-killers, etc.3.  The guild line is not the same as the party situation. There are some very helpful people out there that may play in a guild that isn't allowed on the ranger channel. To party with someone doesn't necessarily indicate support for their actions. It is still a good idea for people to use your head.4.  I would also have to point out that at least they are out killing and fighting. You log on and idle, chat, waste power and offer the guild and the channel members nothing constructive.This is a good aligned guild. It's a role-playing guild. Beck designed it so that the guild members would have to work together to be effective. He also designed it so that most of the guild functions could be handled by the guild members. But, it's also a guild full of people who generally don't log in a lot. I'm not the nanny for this guild.If you want to see changes, I suggest the following:1.  Take responsibility for YOU and YOUR actions. What you do is your decision. Make good decisions, ask for advice, and then DO.2.  A collary to #1. Just Be It. Just Do It. This guild is based around being and doing it. Being a model netizen, player, Ranger, etc. Doing the stuff that it entails.3.  Everything about the Rangers is direted toward working as a team. A team is still comprised of individuals. Be the outstanding individual that puts the team first. Be a Team Leader for goodness sake [and I don't mean that silly title that reflects nothing you've actually done to be a leader]4.  Let your actions be above reproach.5.  Don't speak much. Talk is boring, painful and only works to hurt your ability to do the things you need to do to be effective. Shutup!Vital**blob**Subj: old charsCc: lDate: Jun 14 01:44Hi Beck, I've been trying to get into the rangers for a while, but there havent been any open spots.

I have not one message asking my permission to even work on the Rangers, much less move it entirely. #2 The code should have been copied to be worked on and tested fully in a test environment.  The working guild should have remained in my directory. Right now I am not able to make any changes myself, because my directories are virtually empty, and I have no idea what code has been changed and all the locations it has been affected. #3 Some changes are being done without any understanding of the spirit or intent of myself.  For instance the Ranger list, while nice and compact, now excludes my will to maintain the names of the players that helped create the guild over the last 10 years it has been running. It also excludes such important players as my own character.  My wishes are that the code be moved back into MY directory within 2 weeks. All further development is to be halted except for bugs that still need to be fixed to maintain function. I would like a documented list of all changes being made (a summary will do), at which time I will approve or disapprove them. Once the guild is running again from my directory, all proposal for additional changes may be passed by me. The guild is set up to be fairly self maintaining, but is also designed that additional code may run from other wizards personal directories, without any changes to existing code. All I ask is that this additional code get my approval before entering the game.   I am willing to work with wizards to improve the Rangers, so that it may last another 10 years, but it needs to be done respectfully. Because of the hands off approach, if I receive no mail, and changes are made transparent to my knowledge, I am assuming everything is running as planned.  In fact I would never have known of this current change had I not noticed bugs when checking the status of some normal functions.

Extensive beta testing [Nirvana definition: having players test it] and processing their feedback is far more effective and generates more bug, typo, and idea reports than simulating with a test character in some convoluted laboratory experiment, this would be ESPECIALLY beneficial for you, since you have been completely out of touch with the mud for 5+ years.  > Right now I am not able to make any changes myself, because my > directories are virtually empty, and I have no idea what code > has been changed and all the locations it has been affected.  Why would we expect you to make changes yourself when you have been unable or unwilling to do so for the past five years? The guild is near death, and except for a few lone stragglers, it isn't even considered a viable option by 99% of Nirvana. It has been like that for quite some time. It was a poorly conceived, poorly planned, poorly coded and poorly executed guild. Your ambition far exceeded your talent. Someone has to maintain its monstrosity. This guild has more holes than swiss cheese and the advancement system and lack of player rewards other than adding lame WC and AC bonuses are staggering. What can you say for a guild that cannot use equipment in a mud where EVERYTHING is equipment-based? It means it needs to be VERY creative and VERY original. This mud in its current form is hardly that. Vital's changes are a recode very much in the spirit of the original.

Extensive coding and testing has been done on the guild and it is not the 'self-sufficient' guild that the original creator thought it could be.  Periodic maintenance checks should be made and the code will be reviewed from time to time to assess it's viability.  Thanks, Vital **unforgiving**Subj: Bugs.Cc: (To: vertebraker) sparkle,vital,earwax,fakir,jara,stardream,boltar,forbin,morpheus,linus,pestilence,beck,feldegast,wocket,eurale,starDate: Oct 27 00:21Not sure the bug you think I am abusing.  If your talking about the jinro monster I think the fact he killed me a bunch of times proves its not a bug.  I saw  that you changed mythos monsters so people can not leave said rooms or what not. As far as anything else, I have just logged on to idle mostly.  And maybe look at gossip or something a bit.  As far as being a wiz, I had finished the expansion on my area and was just going to ftp it and have wax approve it or tell me what needed to be changed, balanced and I cant Ftp so I was  just going to drop it.  There are things I did as a wiz character I  shouldn't have.  I admit that and I did not get pissed about it when I had levels removed from me.  I far from abuse any bugs as a player actually as far as bugs go as a player I really don't know any, I know how to kill stuff using judo against a mob, using their own strength against them or using abilities that I can get from the game to the fullest advantage, in no way  do I find crazy bugs and abuse them.  If I did I would be a much higher level than level 5 and I would kill much cooler stuff than Patrons in pizza hut.  If you are delusional enough to think that killing a Patron or a driver in pizza hut warrants abuse than you need an enema to get what ever  is stuck up your butt out. is stuck up your butt out. Heh Zmud, anyway this Mudmail was directed at Vert but I figure it will end  up in his Mbox anyway cause he is a tool so I will just mudmail it to  all who would see it anyway.  Peace out. **vertebraker**Subj: maledictaCc: (To: angel) beck,catt,earwax,eurale,fakir,feldegast,forbin,francesco,fred,gemini,illarion,jamila,jara,jaraxle,jenny,khrell,lacar,linus,lishe,martha,mokri,mosobp,pain,pavlik,pestilence,sampson,skie,sparkle,star,stardream,subotai,tristian,veeshan,vital,wocket,wren,zeusDate: Oct 31 15:44   Maledicta [the wizard] wishes to return to Nirvana.   Please mail a vote [yes/no] and your comment to Vertebraker **tristian** Re:   maledictaCc: (To: vertebraker) angel,beck,catt,earwax,eurale,fakir,feldegast,forbin,francesco,fred,gemini,illarion,jamila,jara,jaraxle,jenny,khrell,lacar,linus,lishe,martha,mokri,mosobp,pain,pavlik,pestilence,sampson,skie,sparkle,star,stardream,subotai,tristian,veeshan,vital,wocket,wren,zeusDate: Nov  2 08:08I am torn on my response to this. I want to say yes, cause he was active, did alot of cool things that the players really enjoyed.  But I want to say no too cause he left, and weather he was one of the ones who removed code from here to start a new mud or just accepted that it happened, i dont know but either way it doesnt seem right to me.  hold on..let me flip a coin... heh just kidding..i guess since we are trying to get player base reestablished, and get this mud back to its heyday of popularity another quality active wizard would be a good idea.  I just dont think he should advance past level 40 for a long time..until he proves himself again...should he come back to his senior wiz status..i say no to that...but yes to his return.  Trist. **earwax**Subj: ranger 'lead' commandCc: vitalDate: Nov 28 05:15Changed /players/guilds/Rangers/Commands/Lead.c to allow rangers to use the mud-wide follow command.  Basically just put it in the check for if they are not in combat and have an arg listed, try to use the mud follow.  -Earwax **oz**Subj: DervishCc: (To: vertebraker) fred,khrell,boltar,beck,vital,fakir,snow,sparkle,stardream,lacar,illarionDate: Dec 13 23:08I am curious how Vahiti/dervish can hold a shield and dual wield? I think it kind of defeats the purpose of the the theme? where does the third hand come from? have they all the sudden become some sort of poly? I am just a little curious, some info would be cool. thanks Oz **vertebraker** Re:   DervishCc: (To: oz) fred,khrell,boltar,beck,vital,fakir,snow,sparkle,stardream,lacar,illarionDate: Dec 14 22:37why are you mailing people that have been inactive for 5 years. **illarion** Re:   DervishCc: (To: vertebraker) oz,fred,khrell,boltar,beck,vital,fakir,snow,sparkle,stardream,lacar,illarionDate: Dec 15 00:33Btw, this is fixed now. **earwax**Subj: Armor shitCc: (To: zeus) wocket,feldegast,pain,jaraxle,eurale,beck,jenny,pestilence,puppy,wren,martha,gemini,angel,jamila,catt,star,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,mokri,sparrow,rumplemintz,aquila,lacar,quicksilver,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,catacomb,hair,veeshan,haywire,skie,sampson,y,chax,lisheDate: Mar 29 02:39I'd like you all to give me some feedback on this shit, just send me a reply to it....basically it involves a HUGE fundamental change to the mud, but one long overdue, i (and many players and wizzes) feel.  Basically, instead of all guilds, all players, using same gear  essentially, and everything being max ac, weight 1, with specials,  this will create a lot of diversity, especially considering that the guilds can be made to utilize the changes very easily.  The file to look at is /open/earwax/armor.txt  Just send a reply, not reply all, or post, I'll be sharing all feedback with the other admins and whatnot.  This is a major deal, so please send your feedback.  -earwax **jaz**Subj: RangersCc: earwax, vertebraker, vitalDate: Apr  2 20:34Heya Beck I got removed from the rangers, i was hoping i could get reinstated without having to start back at lvl 10  Any help anyone can give me with this would be appreciated Jaz the Topaz Ranger **jaz**Subj: yesDate: Apr 11 15:49yes, i am all set now, thanks xx **whitehawk**Subj: Attacks on the guild hall and maybe a solutionCc: vitalDate: Aug  1 14:46I am sitting here wondering what is going on numerous members of Bf are askin up plz dont attack seht cuz they are members of ranger alliance and yet we still do it. I think we need to set something up as far as rules go to set those limits. Twice now I have been on and witnessed either the killing of guild npc's or someone trying to kill the center **sephiroth**Subj: Ranger RosterCc: (To: sparrow) fred,earwax,sephiroth,vital,beckDate: Feb 17 17:41i just checked the list of 55 rangers, removing some of the names from there would be a good idea, there's one (Norris) who hasn't been on in a year and a half and has no xp in the guild, a couple who aren't even rangers anymore but are taking up space, like Marguerite and Redroses for instance. I do know though Ritcher will most likely be making a return, he's Cloud and Cloud's back so he's likely to want to play his Ranger with us at times once Ritcher's player file is restored. but there should be some spaces for people who will be active to become new recruits rather than keeping the list as is with non-members and ones who won't return. you know as well as me man, this isn't fair to those who will be active and want to play a ranger and would do well as one. let me know what you think and what happens so I can keep an ear open for feesible prospects. also if you could, if and when you update the roster list post a news/guild board bulletin about it so people will know there's going to be openings and those who fit the bill of who and what we're looking for, can ask around with us Rangers and see about some new blood. let me know what's up bro. pz! Seph, The Eggplant Bastard!
