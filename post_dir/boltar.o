I can connect with Crimson Editor, but get an error message about Permission being denied. And I can't access my root dir from the cmd line. I don't know whether you changed anything, but it would be nice if we could get a fresh install on this, since it never happened before and something must have gotten corrupted. It"s causing lots of problems for wizards **deagan**Subj: Whiteblade the HunterCc: vertebrakerDate: May 29 19:24I have an issue with the way the Hunter is programmed.  Allowing him to enter areas like ooze and cave just seems completely unfair, especially to those, like me, who are low level and can't hope to defend themselves.  And considering the fact that I can't even retrieve my equipment afterwards, it seems like a total crock. Crip apparently hired the Hunter to kill me and Glaxgor while we were in the caves, just to be a jerk.  At the very least, I'd like to see the Hunter changed so that it can't enter places where you will permanently lose your gear (like caves and ooze).  At most, I'd like my stuff back.  Some high level players invested a lot of time with me in aiding me to get the equipment, and it really upsets me that something like this is able to occur on a mud where everything else is kept to a fairly even balance. I hope you will consider this plea, not as a bitching complaint, but as a issue that needs to be addressed.  Even though Glaxgor is somewhat of a hothead at times, he went Inactive over the issue.  All I ask is that you give this issue a fair hearing. Thank you, Deagan **vertebraker** Re:   Whiteblade the HunterCc: (To: deagan) boltarDate: May 29 20:13I removed Whiteblade from the game. **vertebraker**Subj: nirvanamud.comDate: May 31 17:43I registered us for a domain under nirvanamud.com When we migrate the mud, I'll point nirvanamud.com to the new location. **vertebraker** Re:   nirvanamud.comDate: May 31 18:06yep, sure is. **vertebraker**Subj: missing fileDate: May 31 23:37 /players/pavlik/ilstkarn/ILSTKARN  is missing **vertebraker**Subj: ldmudDate: Jun  1 02:38What's the likelihood of flipping the switch on LDMud out of the blue?  If it's done in the next few days, I can promise to be here for at least 10-12 hours a day [in between jobs/semesters].  All the guilds are working.  I think most of the bugs will just be that #include post-inherit stuff. **vertebraker**Subj: ldmudDate: Jun  1 03:23Please restart the LDMud port when you get a chance. I fucked up an edit to simul_efun...

There are no players on of course, but it ran in no time at all, and on here it took perhaps 30 seconds to complete.  I did some other things and they ran a  lot faster on there as well, so that's a very good sign.  If I think of anything nastier than I've already ran, I'll try it, but it would appear to be that beanos.com is significantly faster than mudservices, which would also lead me to believe it will be a lot more stable, and conducive to having more player population :) **dameon**Subj: char problemsDate: Jul  7 09:10i need someone to try to help this char... i was a guild rank 7 necromancer then i was jailled when i got out of jail...i ws a guild rank 7 samurai. then when i was talking about it they took me out of the samurais and never put me back into the necromancers where i was...nor do i have any of my eq...i will settle for just me getting my guild back if u would please.  **vital**Subj: test charactersDate: Jul  7 13:45I need to get a couple of test characters restored if possible:     Rive     Leatherneck  I also have a couple of player characters that I need to get restored as well:     White     Borealis     Raesh     Black  Thank you in advance. --Vital **vital** Re:   test charactersDate: Jul  9 12:33I don't know exactly when they were purged. There were there in 2006. **earwax**Subj: verteDate: Jul 11 06:17I've had my fill.

This would require an apology to Volkar, at minimum, and persuading Mizan that he has an area outlined, and ready to go in, just needing to be coded, perhaps certain other caveats along the line of absolutely no interaction with players.  I dewizzed him a few minutes ago, as well as resetting his xp, xlevel, stats, guild path, autoloads, etc.  For those that this is cc'd to, it's due to the recent episode in  which he dested a mob, while an invis player was present, then came in as a playerchar and picked up the drop from that mob.

He has been a wiz for some time now.  He just lied right to my face by claiming the act of desting the monster for the items was done in the motivation to fix a bug which was supposedly reported by Gogeta or Teferi or Blake.  I find that the excuse had had of forgetting to set Nighttime's test char flag to be lacking, and quite frankly- insulting.  I also told him that I had no intention of re-wizzing him.  The log of my conversation with him is in /players/mizan/veeshan.log.  Thanks, -tij **remedy**Subj: HeyCc: earwax,vertebrakerDate: Jul 29 19:33Hey Boltar...

This was due to a lot of distrust on him, and  then some discussion with him.  He's done an extremely large number of commands to determine player locations, etc, as his wiz, and statall, and other commands, and done all sorts of other things, including reading weapon files, etc, none of which have anything do do with his wiz position, but everything to do with his player position. Then, he lied to me about the actions he did as pestilence when I  was personally snooping him: he lied about what he did, tells he sent, and his motivations (which were extremely obvious to me in light of his situation as a pc).  He lied repeatedly, he's done less than  nothing as a wiz, meaning his only impact has been negative.    -dave **blake**Subj: pestilenceCc: mizan,vertebraker,fred,mokri,starDate: Aug 14 16:25Pestilence was dewizzed and put to -1.  I'm not sure the exact reason, Dhalek never gave me one, other than asking why my wiz was in the cyber guild hall and knights guild hall. So i would like to apologize for my bad judgement and stupidity.  I had my wiz "pestilence" in those areas because i thought it would be funny for my char Archangel's clan rooms to match those of certain guild rooms.  I also abused my power as a wiz by looking at the 7inn area of tallos to find the hidden exits and I "stat" my character a few times.   I know this was wrong and therefore I'm sorry for those actions.   What i never did is anyway do anything to benefit my characters with the actions of my wizard, other than gaining knowledge and using it to find places to go.  And i do now realize this was wrong. I'm not asking to be rewizzed, I realize using information gained by your wizard by your player character is wrong.  Though i have been told of others doing the same thing and nothing has happened to them.  And being put to -1 seems like a harsh punishment for the crime that has occured.  So if there is some other charge on me, I would really like to know what it is i'm accused of doing.  I appreciate all the work that everyone has done here, and Nirvana has been a part of my life for a long time, it  saddens me that I have let you all down.   Also i know that the code of pestilence's areas belongs to nirvana, but the artistic properties belong to me and i would greatly appreciate it if they would be removed from the game for the time being Thanks Blake aka Pestilence etc   any questions or if there is another reason that i dont know of for my dewizzing please contact me preferrably by email if that's ok  xxxharleyxxx@msn.com  Thanks again  f **vertebraker**Subj: pestilence dewizzingDate: Aug 15 06:37I think the Pestilence dewizzing was rather extreme. You may want to look into this. Or, not. **blake**Subj: pestilence's areaDate: Aug 16 16:56I'm asking again to have this area removed from gameplay. thanks. blake/pestilence **blake** Re:   pestilence's areaDate: Aug 17 17:14 Thank you very much, i appreciate it. Blake,Pesty **mizan**Subj: soul and DC issueCc: (To: fred) boltar,vertebraker,earwaxDate: Aug 18 17:28I reimbursed Soul EXP points caused by a network/lag/latency related death.

I have a little bit of trouble reading what you wrote because some of it does not make sense. But what I did get from this was that:  a) You swapped EQ by accident, as a result of helping another player (Chiele)    get some equipment back. b) This happened around 11:00 AM on Aug 15th.  Trouble is, Chiele did not die on this date, as there is no logged death event within this time window. Therefore barring any further evidence to the contrary, the decision still stands.

Apparently Netvision acquired 013/Barak recently. Bittorrent traffic seems to be dropping pretty badly, and Skype no longer seems to have proper QOS so packets drop, although when she turns up the bitrate things improve.  You should check the news on your side. Apparently the Netvision acquisition of 013/Barak is really fucking up their infrastructure. A lot of people are complaining, and it really isnt anything that we can do unfortunately. So i take back my assessment that there is some inherent security in misreporting ICMP ping traffic. It seems like all hell is going on for people who were former 013/Barak subscribers.  -miz **pesty**Subj: earwaxCc: vertebraker,mizanDate: Aug 25 18:53Earwax has abused his power on this mud, and could be pulling a fast one over everyone.  As I admitted i looked at files etc, where as Earwax had a character caught of botting, and he used his wizchar to let him out of jail!  To me this is not right, nor as bad of a thing as i did.  Also, is this how a high level wiz should use his power, by going to a wiz, who wants to remain nameless at this moment, for fear earwax will be vindictive, and was bitched at and told them it'd be in their best interest to stop talking to me.  And aswell as slandering me by saying i try to get into every woman's pants.  Which offends me very much.  Another thing that has come to my attention when he dewizzed me he accused me of talking with a former wiz, which never occurred, and  that other wizes were watching me, being Fred and Verte.  Both of them have denied that they were watching me in anyway.  So not only does Earwax abuse his powers, it seems he lies to make sure he gets his way.  I know he has done alot for this mud, but he has done equal damage in my belief to the player base, where he runs them off, yet he has done all the cheats that he accuses from players.

If you're going to lie about something silly (like who took the last beer) then how can I count on you when something major comes up?  I still think that you being banned outright was too harsh, but the amount of spin you're putting on your side of the story is steadily making me feel like EW did the right thing.  At this point, what would you want done that would improve things to your satisfaction?

But more on that thought later.  I havent said anything about you except to a few other wizards, so I'm not sure if you're talking to me or Earwax in this respect. I have expressed my displeasure and disappointment in this issue to perhaps two players- Worm, and Veeshan. I have spoken with other wizards such as Katya, Khrell, and a little bit with Boltar, Fred, and Verte. But that's it. Nothing I haven't said to your face i've said outside, so there should be no surprises there.  While I don't trust you completely (being TOTALLY honest here) you didn't do something malicious like attack the mud or try to do outright damage. To me you went down like a death by a million papercuts, with looking at code for the wrong reasons, or for generally goofy and dodgy shit.  So in closing I would support your return, as a L21 or L30 wizard because you did code an area here, are held in generally good regards among the players. But your return would have the following conditions:  1) No L40+ access to other wizard code until trust is regained.    Bear in mind that this can take a serious amount of time.  2) No invis while you have player characters logged in.    This can be code enforced to prevent accidents. It's not meant to    be as a leash. I think you know where I stand on this.  3) No more discussion on the matter, we settle the issue here and now    and not let it fester any further. You've admitted to some part of    what you've done, and while some of us may think there is more-    that stops now- you have a clean slate to try and prove yourself    again, unshackled of prejudice that may have accumulated so far.  These are just my thoughts.

I made one of my test chars a shard and test it and it did not work. so I went through the 6 different files it is in to see how it all works and found that the files where the armors are to come from are not there.  /players/maledicta/closed/shardak/armors that is the file the armors are suppose to  be in but it is empty.  I bugged the room  but wanted to let you know what I found.  I  have not searched to see if the items have been moved somewhere else.  Let me know if there is more I can do.                     Angel **fakir**Subj: pestilenceCc: mizan,fred,pestilence,vertebraker,angel,wormDate: Aug 13 00:06I I'm not sure the reason his level was nuked. Prolly some political deal like most level nukes. If he wants to guild wiz the Shards,  I see no problem with it. I'd like to  see what Fred has to say though. I would be happy to oversee or approve any changes to the guild power. I am not in favor of a large boost in power to the shards. They have a good base already. However, if they want to modify a few things, so be it. My opinion, if someone WANTS to do something  around here, let em. I'm around enough to know whats going on, and Fred can do the same I suppose. **mizan** Re:   pestilenceCc: (To: fakir) boltar,mizan,fred,pestilence,vertebraker,angel,wormDate: Aug 13 01:16The reason his levels were nuked were not "political", he was doing lots of silly things like finding out what players were carrying and using it to his own advantage. It happened some time ago and i'm a bit fuzzy on the details, and at this point I do not care.  But... when faced with multiple seniors that caught him doing stupid, relatively minor things, he chose not to come clean but instead spread "political" crap accusing me and others of framing him, among other things.  He didn't even keep his story straight and never apologized to anyone.  This part- I do remember clearly as I was often the target of "politics".  He went down by a thousand cuts and can stay down as far as i'm concerned.  If he wants to be a shardak guild wiz- sure. But no levels greater than 30, so he can't see other wizs' files, and can remain focused on his own stuff.  If he hadn't been such an ass about things in the past and just said "yeah i goofed" i would have a more favorable opinion, but too bad.  Just my own "political" opinion. **worm**Subj: sheeshCc: (To: mizan) boltar,fred,pestilence,vertebraker,angel,wormDate: Aug 13 01:59exactly what the subject says.. sheesh, i love mizan, i wouldnt have his babies.. but only because i'm far prettier than him. but i know the story, i've heard a more straight forward version. one from everyone involved on the 'guilty' side. there is one simple fact i will beat until the end. mizan has code used all the time,  so does he. they're both good guys in my book. they could both do whatever they wanted, even desting me, zapping me, jailing and or banning me.. and i'd just be glad it was one of them. one of our own.. one who's been here for the long haul. i'm not taking sides.. and i'm only some lowly player, but i think he deserves respect. and everyone slips up. cheating? seriously? .. i could toss names but i wont. but there are others who've cheated.. and would never be punished. Pestilence has been.. and if you all knew the whole truth behind why, you'd all (Mizan included) shrug it off. No, he didnt come clean.. and now he's paid.

I think  before we need to try and get the name out with advertisement we should revamp the newbie system in which I had put together a quality recommendation to wax before his issues popped up.  I can send it to  you.  I think we need to look at many factors to improve the game for players.  The rules are what you say they are so they can be changed. I was checking out several large muds to see what they offer and one thing I noticed was the there penalty for death in most of them  low, around 10% exp loss and 1 stat or no stats lost. I think it would be a good idea to considered.  I have a lot of ideas and want to know if you are willing to make some changes to get a player base back. I would love to see folks around here, I love this place and hate to see it empty.  I know it a great place and fun but it need, I think we need some more rules in place for new wizes not to be able to mess up, including putting all new wiz's PC's  player charaters files where they have no access to them till they are level 60.  Also, for the player it is no good to have an end to levels cause once you get to level 19+100 you have nothing else to strive for. we could make this extremely high to get each next level and more for each current level, keep 1-19 as is but all + levels more like the ranger stats are set up, but with high amounts set up and no cap.  I know I am ranting on but want to actually talk with you a bit.  I am going shopping the rest of the day but will get back online tonight and I am sure you see that  I am still on a lot, most doing thing around the house but page works great if I am on but not at key board.  We can bring this place back but it will take some work, well a lot of work, but I think it is worth it.  I have lots of  Ideas just need you to approve some and need help with coding  some.  also I am not sure what the deal with Mokri is, do you know? can you share the info if you do. I talk with all the time you know he is our regular guest.  All he will say is the big man is keeping him down, not sure what that means. Anyway he is always here doing nothing but he is close to finishing up his mudlib that he does not want to create his own mud with but give it out to others, sound like it would be pretty good, it is coded as an upgrade to LD, well you may already know this but if not it might be an idea to use it,  instead.  Well, I have gone on long enough. I am just looking out for the best interest of this place staying open and useable.                  Thanks for reading!

I might prove to be more cut out to do guild work than areas/items. Never know until I try. Anyway, let Fred and I know your thoughts on the matter.

I know this is a really random thing to ask you, however, it's popped up in my mind quite a bit. I was wondering if I had a chance at becoming a wizard, if I met the requirements to become a wizard. I know my past has been very... annoying. I wish I could go back and prevent myself from playing Nirvana until now since I'm much more mature than I was 6-7 years ago. I know that I've done some really bad things here and I really regret it. I know an apology doesn't fix anything however I thought I'd try ;)  So therefore, I was wondering if there was any possibility of me becoming a wizard. If there is a possibility, I look forward to becoming a part of the wizard community. If not, I'm very sorry for wasting your time with this mail.  Thanks/Sorry in advance, Mark (Billy/Viper/Maximus/etc.) **shinshi**Subj: heya boltsDate: Apr 18 06:53Was wondering if you could hook me up with FTP access for Crimson Editor when you get the chance.

I've already talked to Worm since I got his mail, but I knew about this earlier.  Wicket spoke to me when I logged in earlier today. According to him he put a wall up to block Desterus from leaving the room where he was fighting.  Last I checked, that was not illegal, and as far as I know, not even harrassment.  Wicket is a Shardak, and getting someone killed to steal their gear is just what they do.  If we reimbursed every player a Shardak tricked and got killed, maybe I could understand, but we don't.  It's part of the game.  If my son's character was killed by one, I'd shrug, tell him I did warn him about them, then log in one of my players and legally assist him in getting his things back.  But beyond that, I have another concern about the entire issue.  When I saw Desterus log in the first time, my first thought was that Chip was making a new player character.  His IP is exactly the same.  Either Chip's cousin plays from his house every time he logs in, or it's no cousin. He's under three hours old, and level ten.  Either he's been partied, or there's no way he's a true and real newbie.  I have a very bad suspicion that Chip is Desterus and that he replaced his own player character's stuff after getting killed in a way that may not seem fair, but as far as I know is not illegal.  I don't like it, and I've been sick to my stomach since Wicket first talked to me.  And seeing as how I don't feel the need to broadcast my suspicions, or include players in the mess, this one gets CC'd to a lot fewer people than Worm's did..  Star **worm**Subj: NirvanaCc: x,tristian,fred,mizan,star,shinshi,angel,khrell,artos,achillesDate: May  6 00:02 Now that we've started to reestablish a playerbase, I have a bit of input I think may help. I feel that rather than reopen old guilds, or open new guilds, that touching up current guilds, adding new things to them would catch the attention of ppl we already have back playing. It would be awesome to assign wizards to each guild, trying to update them in anyway we can. That would build intrest in playing/killing more.. at the  same time, ppl would be out leveling more, helping lower levels etc. Just bringing a fresh feel back to the game. Artos feels having a PK Tourny once in awhile would help. He pointed out attracting pkers, ppl who like to chat a lot over public channels would also help gain intrest for players in the game, attracting old/new players etc. Honestly, I think the MUD has already taken a breath of fresh air and is on a nice roll. I'm just hoping we can all pitch in, in any way we can to help it keep on rolling. So, even though i'm just a player, I figured i'd start pestering you guys with ideas.. some i'm sure you'll blow off, others I hope you'll consider. Although, once again, i'd like to point out one thing.. I know rules are in place and need to be followed, but I think warnings should be given. Like a strike 1,2,3 and you're jailed.. rather than just jailing and banning.  To tell you the truth, losing just one player could lead to possibly losing his friends. While we're trying to revive this place, I think every player counts. I know Bolts ends up at the end of all the drama, so I think the wizards should handle most things themselves, without jailing when possible. I'm just hoping we can find a way to keep it fun for everyone involved.  Anyway, thanks for your time.. if you've read this far. ;)  -me *8 oopsee **nefarious**Subj: Request to wiz.Cc: (To: fred) boltar,mizan,xDate: May  6 17:45I have no idea why you all feel the need to discriminate against me. I have been contributing in everyway I can for quite sometime now. Admit it or not, I am the one who started gathering back up players for your game.

Those are Fantasy and Panther. I hope you find my request reasonable.  Thanks for your time and for keeping this place sound.  Yours  Coldwind h f f end **earwax**Subj: let's talk, i'm boredDate: Jun  7 05:02i made a mistake before with verte, but then again, if you were privy to our arguments, it'd be easier to explain...but anyways i hate seeing this place this way, i'm bored, and i'd like to get back in the mix. anyways, it's on you, i'd like to code again and pick up the whole ld  thing, since apparently it got dropped immediately before, and it's really hateful to me seeing the playerbase like it is.  i've screwed up, and  frankly, it's half due to alcohol and half due to just being really really pissed at what i felt at the time was pure abuse, althouth in retrospect, i'm not as sure... anyways, you know my history, you know i'm far more on the side of anger and integrity than i am, abuse and stupidity, so you know how i make my mistakes...but i really really hate seeing this place in the state it is,  and while i don't know how much time i have to devote, i'd like to do my part **earwax**Subj: correctionDate: Jun  7 05:10well, it's not only that i want to do my part, but there's another thing mizan has no place putting in his finger info anything about me, and he don't have a damn thing to do with me, and he was never anything other than a subordinate, so if i do come back he needs to remove it and make  a damn statement regarding he shouldn't have said shit, it wasn't his  place, etc...not to place demands, i'm just saying, what the situation and history are...i REALLY resent this, and i would have been mailing you long before this if it hadn't been for that message that i was told about years ago....but that's your call, i'm just saying, i want to be involved, and that's one of the obstacles to me... **earwax**Subj: one last thingDate: Jun  7 05:23ok, i've made my mistakes...but you can't say you're on the right track now...i mean the playerbase is basically gone...i've made my efforts with a couple people, and they've done wonders in the short term, but it isn't what it was...if i'm back, i can get verte back, i can get some  people back, i mean, as a player alone, i pull a lot of people...that's not shittalk, that's over 5 years of history...but as a wiz, i have my people, but that's also beside the point...i really really hate seeing this place die, i mean, this was one of my original muds, and if i ever thought this was going to happen, i'd have thought more before my actions take that for what it's worth, it's not worth much, but whatever... My intent is to get my wizzes back, and my friends back, and i think i can do very well in those two regards. **earwax**Subj: about the aboveDate: Jun  7 05:24i assume you know, but that shit's between you and me all these mails are between you and i, nobody elses' business **blackblade**Subj: ThanksDate: Jun  8 14:52Greetings again. I just wanted to thank you for returning my chars back. Thanks again and looking forward to do this. **fuckbeanos**Subj: earwax's passwordDate: Jun 10 07:15mizan changed it anyways, i don't know if you mailed me back, but that's the deal i think that's pretty fucked up, but mail me back as bleh or orb or whoever, or not... david **quicksilver**Subj: Restoration?Date: Jun 10 15:16Hi Boltar!  I'm back and I have a bit of free time over the next few months -- and I was thinking...

I apologize if I duplicate the message.  I don't know if silence is "no" or if my first mail got lost in the surely endless piles of messages you got. Anyway, I just thought I would ask one more time if it is possible to restore one or both of my purged characters from many years ago, Wulfe and Ahzrei. Both were in their early + levels, Ahzrei as a guild-maxed vampire, and Wulfe as the Chosen One of the cyberninjas. They are probably close to 10 years old, so I don't know if it is even feasible. If not that's fine of  course, I plan on restarting both of them. But if it is possible, that would be awesome.   Best and thanks for the time,  -- wulfe/ahzrei/tank **raz**Subj: HelloDate: Jun 26 20:02Its been a few years since i logged Ironman and i don't remember his pass i was hoping you could reset it also i've had a request to bring maxy back Ironman PS why is master banished h **hawkman**Subj: Death by DCDate: Jun 27 12:24Now I have remembered why I quit playing the last time.

I figured theres 1 really great way to truely piss him off. To see him die over and over fair and square. Not only does he boast of being able to  'Hack the Planet!' or whatever that lame crap he talks about is, mud security, mizans chars! blah blah blah.. he talks about how he's the best pker ever! the best player / tank in the game!  etc etc. It's stupid.. and personally, i'd love to see him have his face rubbed in it. So tonight, I set him up to die to Equilibrium. He died in 2 rounds.. it was amusing.. he wasnt happy. Now he says he has 'reason to play and get even' .. heh This should be funny. On a more serious note.. he did say again that if he wanted to, his hacking of the mud and shit would be done. He seems quite sure. Now, I KNOW he's full of shit about pk and playing.. but the hacking crap i'll just have to trust you guys when you say he's no threat. Just keep an eye on him I guess.. just in case? *shrug* You all know far more about all that than me. Anyway.. take care.  -me **raz**Subj: Raz RestoreCc: razDate: Jul 10 22:38I was wondering if i got Raz restored if i could keep my mage glevel its taken a few days of hard work to get this high thanks for your consideration Raz the Handpuppet High Commander party say if i can keep my glevel in the mages i'd like raz to be restored and pass reset becasue i don't remember my old one pss stupid p.s alias l8r h f **diabla**Subj: lillygirlDate: Jul 12 23:44I need to have the password reset for Lillygirl please.   Don't remember the password and I was interested in logging in today  Thanks :-) x . q **kikio**Subj: Softwind, my bardCc: **Date: Jul 16 16:29If you can when you get the time could you bring Softwind back to the mud? I believe she was like level 19+3 or +4 and guild maxed.

This was your last tell:  22:35:04 Hawkman tells you: my point is its not right and it shows someone is messing with things they shouldnt be  Can you prove this? I am not messing with you because quite frankly you are not worth the time for me to mess with. I do not mess with people like you because there is frankly no real motivation to do so. It is not rewarding, and the fact that you whine about anything and everything makes it rather annoying on top of it all. For the record, while you were pestering me with tells, I was busy, preparing the new server which will replace the current machine that this game runs on. I don't appreciate your sass and as a directive to anyone else who cares to listen, I will only say this: Everyone, please ignore Whitehawk and any of his characters unless you are prepared to devote ALL and EVERY IOTA of  attention to his well being, his desires, and all of his general wants. Which for most of us (since we are not paid and do this for the fun of it)... will be NEVER.  There is no wizard conspiracy against you, because I will speak for many if not all- We consider your whining presence simply not worth the effort. We have other things to conspire about, such as what to do with Jimmy Hoffa's entombed corpse in Giants Stadium when the facility is scheduled for demolition. It's really a fucking pain in the ass because while ALL of us were present when his tattered, bloated corpse was dumped unceremoniously into the cement- none of us are sure of EXACTLY where he is buried.  SO PLEASE forgive us if we dont respond right away to your princely presence (within 2 seconds) because right now the loss of Hoffa's exact location is fucking Khrell's fault, and he still hasn't paid me back for those beers.  Yours sarcastically, Captain Assjesus **whitehawk**Subj: HarrassmentCc: (To: aingeal) boltarDate: Aug 12 16:50Mizan is really starting to make me mad he comes in way after the fact for no apparent reason and just disses me for what I feel is the right thing to do, it was commented on and dropped there was no reason to bring it back up. **delorean**Subj: WellCc: (To: aingeal) boltar, fred, mizan, vertebreakerDate: Aug 19 10:25Well I have tried to separate my characters but it appears I cannot even do that because I was betrayed by my own mother, the whole fact is everything was kosher until that point I showed respect to the best of my ability and it made no difference. I dont know what else to do, Ive tried everything but apparently as long as my mother plays noone around here will respect me because she continues to ruin it for me and i dont dare confront her about the issue because she has her own issues she needs to resolve   Lost Delorean, Whitehawk, Hawkman, Youngblood, Redhawk, Harker and prolly a few more **data**Subj: .acl fileDate: Aug 19 13:58fred informs me that I need a .acl file for ftp, could you send me one? **shinshi**Subj: Heya BoltarDate: Aug 22 11:26Was thinking about starting to work on a guild.

The guild is called the Assassins which was originally made by Deathmonger. I looked in Earwax's open directory (/open/earwax/guilds/assassins.txt) and found that file which explained what could be put in, what has already been put in, etc. I was told that you cannot use another wizards code if it hasn't been put into the game and that you have to get the OK by the original wizard that started it. However, seeing that Deathmonger is not around any longer, I was wondering if I could gain permission to continue his work through you. I appreciate you reading this and hope to hear from you soon :D Thanks, Shinshi **illarion** Re:   bardsDate: Aug 24 18:47Understood.

I don't really care about what he does or says, and I have encouraged other wizzes not to provoke him by even responding to anything he has to say. Yes. That is my official stance. Just flat out ignore him no matter how irritating his words may be. Don't bother him, don't help him, don't hinder him, just ignore him completely. But let him speak.  I know it sounds counter-intuitive but I encourage you to do the same, and even spread the word about it to others if possible. Delorean may be a griefer and a selfish little twit, but he has a right to login to this game and play.  In the past I have not been as saintly and approachable either, and I recognize that. In the past I have done things like delete his characters or siteban him and it has not changed his behavior. When I returned to here a few months ago,  I made an offer to start off with him on a clean slate. I believe I have held my end of the bargain. However he has chosen not to. But I'm cool with that.  Rather than wipe him off the MUD i chose a different vent for dealing with him. I made a comic which features some of his antics, of which there are two episodes so far visible at:  http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/a-barycentric-griefing-motion/ and http://hobostein.beanos.com/2009/08/the-third-fastest-thing-in-the-world/  Again, I encourage others to simply ignore him, and let peace and contentedness be in your soul rather than pure rage that (insertDeityHere) has forsaken us and left us such a miserable little shitfucker to suffer with. Delorean and his kind are a vital part of this MUD's ecosystem, as we need diversity... strong PK'ers, roleplayers, socialites, coders, whining douchebags- We need them all.  There is a saying in Arabic which does not translate well, but I'll try- "I let my enemies dine at my doorstep because it is my pleasure, God willing." So paraphrased my take on that is: "I let Delorean play here and speak what he wants because it is my pleasure."  So you know what to do. The next stupid thing he does, mudmail me a transcript and I will credit you appropriately on my next comic strip(s).  Thank you for reading. -Miz **deathblow**Subj: Sexual HarassmentCc: (To: aingeal) boltarDate: Sep 15 15:04Ok someone has changed my race im not going to point any fingers because I dont know 100% sure who did it all I know is I would like it fixed as soon as possible f **angel**Subj: Katya's return???Date: Sep 15 20:56Hello Boltar,       Hey not sure if you have read this: http://nirvana.beanos.com/secret/wiki/tiki-view_blog_post.php?postId=4 But I want to know 1) what is you take on this? 2) can we put some rules in place to be used for ex-wizards to return once they have been officially   de-wizzed.  3) This is your mud and some things,no disrespect to but blow my mind on the lacks-a-daisyical things are.

I know it not from you. I just like set rules and things to make sense.  I also like there to be some sense of order and a chain of command which seems to absent at the moment.  It would be nice to have folks to know who does each job and not to have different +100's trying to do things there way with out going through a chain of command.  I guess that is the store manager in me.  I also am the Team leader for my grade level at my school, so being a boss in my blood. I have 2 more grad classes and my Masters in Admin will be done.

I am actually very indifferent, contented, and don't get upset at your temper tantrums like I used to. You may find this true as I have not had to dest, threaten, or resort to incredible amounts of violence against you since I came back. You can continue to hate my guts, and that's okay.  The purpose of this message is not to scold you, but only to try and bring some awareness to your attitude on the channels. You have a habit of  demanding service in a demeaning manner. I am asking you to take a step back and think of what you're doing. Typically it involves 'I need a wiz' followed by some expression of anger (hrmph) and something like foot tapping. Think about what kind of service you will get if you were at a bar, and did that. Would the bartender be as inclined to serve you? Probably not so much. To top this off, none of the wizards are not paid. People do this out of their own volition, as a hobby.  In the past wizards would get combative with you. But people have figured out that is a bad idea, so they just ignore you instead. I am writing to you because you seem to have pissed off the last of the wizards who were willing to help you. So I am asking you to just evaluate yourself and what attitude you are projecting when you need help. You don't have to resort to bullshit flowery language like "Hello kind ladies and gentlemen of the wizard department, can I get some assistance please"... I'm totally not asking you to do that. I'm just asking you to take a good look into the situation you're in. I wasn't kidding when i said you can continue to hate my guts until the day you die. But think about this for a moment. I don't hate you, and I don't have to vent any anger on your behalf. Doesn't that effort and energy you're spending on wanting my head on a stick seem a bit foolish, wasteful, and misplaced now?  I have taken steps to re-examine my policies in the past and present, and as you may have noticed, the tone of this mail is conciliatory and sincere. I'm not going to threaten, or raise my voice, or be a prick about things. I simply don't have to and life is too short for that kind of stuff.  Sincerely, -miz  **rumplemintz**Subj: Area DescriptionsCc: starDate: Sep 17 13:54When putting in these public areas (Padrone, Kantele, Angmar), the room descriptions are not up to the current approvals, but they are also not my code.  Should we leave them the way they are and maintain the original coders descriptions?  **aingeal** Re:   Sexual HarassmentCc: (To: deathblow) boltarDate: Sep 20 21:11I will look into it.

The reason to use force() instead of just calling the function is so this_player() will be correct when attack() is called. Not sure what's causing the bug, specifically - probably the attacker object isn't getting properly passed to the weapon function.  This won't really be fixed until there's a better way of implementing additional attacks - something else I've been looking into but haven't done anything about yet. **worm**Subj: hehDate: Oct 16 04:44Man.. it was all my choice.

I want to granularize (sp?) some code and it makes logical sense to me to have them in directories that define what the modules are.  My goal isn't to change anything right away, but to bring some existing stuff up to date and make it easier to work with. The end result as far as players are concerned will not change - at least not with existing stuff.  Take for example /room/room.c - our base room object.  It contains all the code for exits, descriptions, light, properties, etc... but soem other objects use descriptions, properties.  Why not make those basic modules, that anything can inherit and use instead of having to code them into the base object.  These would fall into the /basic directory, as basic modules.  Anything that inherits multiple modules and defines some more functions that are unique to itself would become an example of a complex object (such as the room)  We could continue to keep these in /obj or /room - but i think those are better suited for actual items or rooms, not modules or base objects.  Of course there would have to be backwards compatibility built in or none of this matters.  Keep in mind i'm not trying to change the way anything that already exists works.  I'm just trying to lay some framework so that when we decide (if!) to move to LD that there is a solid foundation to work with for adding NEW stuff.  Hope that explains it!

The current server is a traditional Linux server running the CentOS 4.7 32 bit distribution. This is an 'end of life' product which has been superceded by the CentOS 5.x series.  What I am planning on doing is replacing the server with a newer machine that runs a hardware assist virtual machine environment. In English this means that the new machine will be hosting several virtual servers, one of which will be a dedicated machine just for Nirvana. These virtual machines run completely independent of one other. The changes will be imperceptible for most of you, but what is happening under the hood will be a major change. I am going to try migrating the OS to Ubuntu Server 9.10, 32 bit.  This will be a gradual process. First I need to move the server to the datacenter, the timeframe of which will be sometime in January.  Once the hardware is installed, the process of trying to move things over will start, and will be the 'slow-and-steady' parallel process.  I have zero intention of 'hot swapping' the old machine with the new without having anything tested. Things are subject to change but I will keep everyone posted.  Thanks, -tij **rumplemintz** Re:   LD directoriesDate: Dec 17 09:29Sounds good.  Is the password necessary?

I am writing you in regards to wizardry.

When I relogged I was unsure as to what the circumstances were but asking around it seems that I was dewizzed in a 'clean sweep'. I don't recall being formally disciplined or demoted and would love to continue to create and learn to code. I have a newbie area in game and my mid-high level area is almost done and my directory seems to still be here. So I thought I would ask permission to become a wizard again.

I want them to wear out. I want very few avenues of repairing armors and weapons, and I want it to be costly. I want unbreakable weapons held to an absolute minimum (usually gained thru some sort of quest), (or enchantments that last for a short amount of time).  Weapon repair is way too easy now. I'm not going to fault the implementer of the "dsharpen" command since sharpening right now is very easy to do. But we have gotten way off track here.

I decided to create a new character recently and I can say that at low levels weapon upkeep is no small matter. If you throw armor into the mix it would be almost unbearable for a true newb. Maybe making the cost of repair or access to a qualified artisan be based on quality of the item. Make it more  expensive for high quality gear and not all smiths/armorers are up to the task. This will also help with an issue that I think we have: newbies with legendary gear. If they cant afford the upkeep they will be more likely to use gear that is more appropriate to their level.  Anyways that's my two cents **boltar** Re:   item decayCc: (To: sparrow) vertebraker,fred,boltar,sparrow,mizan,angel,vertebraker,rumplemintz,illarionDate: Feb 16 23:56 I am more with sparrow on this. too make things too much of a pain will only discourage people. good stuff should also last longer than cheap stuff.

In the dir /players/mizan/opl/generator are the tools i am currently coding/messing with to create the realm I am working on which is essentially just a giant, randomly generated maze.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/generate_maze.py is some Python code which currently is hardcoded to build 100 x 40 sized text mazes. The #'s are navigable areas, while the periods are no-man lands. It can be executed on a system with Python installed by invoking 'python generate_maze.py'.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/compile_maze.sh is just a little script that saves human-readable output of the maze to file, and also makes a copy which has no line breaks.  /players/mizan/opl/generator/process_maze.pl is then the perl code which actually builds up the .c room files which are all stored in /players/mizan/opl/CELLS. My code as usual is not formatted very cleanly because it's a work in progress. Essentially in this file, I read the output from compile_maze.sh, and iterate through all the rooms. I am basically counting exits- if I see dead ends, I randomly put a monster or something interesting in it. If I see intersections, I crowd them up with monsters that 'block' them. Things like that.  Additionally, here is something which may be of great interest to Verte. http://iceyboard.no-ip.org/dg/ This is an instant town generator, written in PHP. The code is available at http://iceyboard.no-ip.org/dg/?source=1  Also, a cave generator which I found lives inside /players/mizan/opl/generator/cave shows promise, it just needs some tweaks so that certain passages always remain 'open'.  I'm no expert on this stuff, it's been a bit of here and that tinkering for me so far. Go nuts. -tij  **sparrow** Re:   Stuff i have been working on which may be useful to othersCc: (To: mizan) vertebraker,boltar,vertebraker,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,sparrow,angelDate: Feb 23 01:33Thanks Miz, I've been looking it over and I dig it. Just a note of something  that I've been wanting to do: Encounters. I've talked to Miz and Verte about it and I think it is very promising. Right now it is still in the planning stages but with Verte on board it should be moving forward rather soon. Here is the quick and dirty: Instead of cloning a monster, the room will load an encounter based on the level of the party leader. An encounter master daemon will be cloned to run the encounter, moving the party to a 5x5 room arena. The master will then build a list of npc's and distribute them throughout the arena. The daemon will keep track of the locations of the npcs as well as the players. The room long descriptions will actually request locations of the npc/player parties and display a map showing the location of each npc/party member. Npc's will be tagged with different roles such as Tank, Caster, Support and Ranged. A seperate daemon will take care of AI for the different  roles. Tanks will charge into battle, supports will buff and heal npcs, casters will cast spells (duh) and ranged will rain down projectiles as long as they are not engaged by the player party members. Also, players with ranged type weapons will be able to enter the same 'RANGED MODE' which will allow them to target a npc on the map and deal damage (albeit minimal) each round as long as they are not engaged directly. Experience will be handed out once the encounter is completed (no exp if the party flees) and treasure will be generated as well. I know this is very ambitious but I definately know it is within our ability. Ideally I think we should build it in a way that any wiz can use it, and customize it to his/her tastes with some sort of config file.  Like I said this is just in the planning stages but I  would like to get as much input on it as possible. I think this would help with the issue of players grinding in the same areas, for the same gear, and I've never seen this type of system on any other mud. Sparrow, the Scatter-brained Idea Machine **boltar** Re:   Stuff i have been working on which may be useful to othersCc: (To: sparrow) mizan,vertebraker,boltar,vertebraker,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,sparrow,angelDate: Feb 24 20:10   I like the idea of making the rooms variable and keyed to who goes in them. if can be done that sounds like an excellent idea to make  things much more interesting.  **illarion** Re:   do_special() and armor strikesCc: (To: vertebraker) boltar,vertebraker,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,sparrow,angelDate: Feb 24 21:47Rather than simply blocking additional calls, what about making them less and less likely? First call always goes off, second is if(!random(3)), (33%), !random(6), !random(12), !random(24), etc **sparrow** Re:   do_special() and armor strikesCc: (To: illarion) vertebraker,boltar,illarion,fred,rumplemintz,mizan,star,angelDate: Feb 24 22:47I am with Illarion 100% on this.

Whereas I think that this is a cool ability, and I don't know what he had to pay to purchase this ability for his clan, I didn't like the fact that he could create one in the Village Green. As far as I'm concerend, these walls should only be able to block monsters or pkers. Normal players should be able to pass through a door in the wall or something. Major disruptions in gameplay could occur with walls being set up in the main village spine. Krylos was setting up a trap in case Heinous logged in, he  wanted to keep him from making it to his clan hall before he could attack him. I'm fine with that, it just blocks everyone else too from getting to the shop, advancement, post office, anything east of the green.  PK areas are open game, but I feel this should be changed a  bit.

Here's the entire story:  Heinous has been able to glean access on highlander's alt characters, I do not pretend to know how, that is neither here nor there. He had been using this information for the last few months to keep highlander from joining the sam's  with any character. This has been going on since before HL became a wiz. I had been warning Heinous that he needed to practice character seperation for the last three or four weeks. In the meantime I had been telling HL to focus on his area and give it time, that I would try to talk some sense into heinous. HL finished his area and put it up for approval. I'm assuming that he has been bored since then because the quest to gain a samurai had begun anew. He asked me if it would be alright if he logged in Kadaj with a new character just so he could chat on public channels to give the impression that it was not him. There was no equip/kills between the two characters. He spoke with Heinous and met the requirements to join the samurai. Afterwards I spoke with Heinous and informed him on what went on. All I wanted to show him was that HL could indeed create a character  that met his approval. I appologized to him for the  deception and I told him that he could do what he wanted with HL's character, he could remove him from the guild, he could let him fail on his own.  Maybe I was too tired, maybe I need to stay away from  players, none-the-less I made a bad decision. A lot of the time I am the only active wiz on, I get flooded with issues like this all of the time. Normally I tell those involved to forward it to Fred. Anyways I'm staying away from players from now on, I have too much work to do and too little time to do it. Vertebraker is only  involved because he backed me up after the fact. I try to be a good and fair admin, I go out of my way to make sure things run smoothly - this was not done to undermine the game itself, my intentions were fully disclosed. I understand that it is not my job to decide, or enforce for that matter, what is fair or right.  I accept full responsibility for this fiasco and await punishment. I just ask that I still have access to work on my projects. Ignorance is no excuse and I truly am sorry. I not only undermined my own authority but that of those that trusted me with this responibility. Sparrow **rumplemintz**Subj: Re: SparrowCc: vertebraker,fred,mizanDate: Mar 11 10:10So, from what I gather, the 'crime' was that he revealed information to a player, that should only be known to wizards (if at all).  I'm not one that has ever been the 'sheriff', so I'm not going to claim to know what type of punishment should be handed out for this.  He does seem to realize what he has done, and admit it without question or lying/trying to hide it.  This may be because Verte witnessed it as well, or just his character, i'm not sure.  Whatever you decide, I will stand behind and enforce. **mezmurders**Subj: Some old Chars deletedCc: mizanDate: Mar 14 20:28hey boltar its darkfyre i was wonder if you would be able to deleted some old characters of mine for me so i can make a fresh start tired of people login in and knowing me i wanna start a new except for a few characters i wish to kill here is the ones i wanted to know if you can delete and the one i wanna keep  ones for deletion if possible ravennight aftershock katsumoto chaotic demonic those are the ones i would like deleted if possible the ones i wish to keep is  mezmurders leinhart hades darkfyre cearwyn morphus and forgotten **mosobp** Re:   Re: Clan Wall spell?Cc: (To: sparrow) boltar,rumplemintz,vertebraker,fred,illarion,star,angel,mosobp,khrell,mizanDate: Mar 16 10:40this is a clan spell that is used by a lot of pkers and can be cancelled by attacking the wall **mizan**Subj: Highlander demotionCc: vertebraker,star,fred,illarion,mizan,sparrow,angelDate: Apr  6 18:07Sorry this is so curt, i need to catch a train. I demoted Highlander to L19 today. He is not a good fit as a wiz. I have no doubts that he is going to whine to you guys. I'll explain this in greater detail after i get home tonight.  Thanks -tij **highlander**Subj: mizan dewizDate: Apr  6 20:29I am not sure what/if anything you have been told about this but mizan dewizzed me just because i muffled wiz channel during one of his 'you r a shitty wiz' tyraids.  is there anything you can/would do about this.  i fulfilled my obligation to become a wiz...+100 character and three seniors to sponsor me.  just because this is HIS server dont give him the right to dewiz me cause i get tired of listening to his shit about me being amateur coder.  please if you can do anything about this i have earned the right to be wizard and have not broken any wizard rules that warrant getting dewizzed.  i would like my wizard status reinstated  thank you **rasha**Subj: mizanDate: Apr  6 20:55ok i dont know if your going to do anything about this or anything....god forbid you take action over someone who has YOUR game on their server.  but not only has mizan dewizzed highlander for no justifiable reason but has also jailed him after mizan tellblocked highlander and had to take conversation to gossip\ **carter**Subj: new altCc: **Date: Apr 17 01:46i wish to make a alt but the name i would like is banish for some reason i was wondering if i can get that name unbanish so i can use it the name is Noctis **worm**Subj: FB FrenzyCc: (To: mizan) illarion,vertebraker,sparrow,shinshi,fred,angel,valen,boltarDate: May  8 01:30Artos is all excited over the FB and Fmud stuff.. he has Lyric all ready to write up some really nice stuff to help explain things to new players, etc etc.. and honestly, the potential is really there to pull in some new people..

I merely mved all of his characters to name.mizan.deleted.o in their respective dirs within /pfiles. I had to do this one other time in the past (oddly enough also at his request) and what will hopefully happen (again) is that he will come to his senses and ask them to be restored again.  Poor kid. He needs some serious help, and I think I make a very poor surrogate for real psychiatric care. I have no doubt he is going to scream for a little while and make a stink, but i've tired of coddling him of late. In fact all of the players have been putting up with him too. He's going need some 'tougher love' for a little while, and then when he asks for his characters back we'll probably get a few more months of humility and  relative peace again.  If anyone has a better suggestion/solution I am all ears :)  TL:DR - Hawkman threw a fit, wanted me to delete his chars.

On top of those whom he invited, I've invited close to 30 people myself, and hopefully they have more people they can invite as well. In light of this, and knowing I don't have that kind of access, we would like to request a couple of things from the administration, in hopes it will help bring life back to the mud. The first of those requests, is a significant increase, or even maybe removal, of the limit on the number of players that can be in a party. If even half of the people invited make it, there will be 15+ people on at one time, many of whom we can surely say would love to socially group together, definitely with more than 5 to a group. Or, as an alternative (I'm not sure how hard it would be to do by comparison), maybe make it so you can link groups together. Like, form 2 5-person parties, and link them so the channel and experience gains are linked between the groups. Without the social aspect of the mud, it won't go very far in the way of trying to bring it back from the dead, and this sort of thing would help incredibly. The other request is in regards to the alignment killing restriction of Power Rangers. Even if it's just for the reunion day, we would like to request this restriction be lifted, as I know for a fact several of the attendees will be playing their Ranger characters. With this restriction lifted, even if it is just for a day, it will help as far as not limiting where and what these groups (or hopefully, one really big group! lol) can go after. Rangers are generally limited to barely more than half of the mud's npcs, and this would take much of the fun from the reunion day's attentees, knowing they only have a small amount of stuff to do, then waiting for respawns and such. Lastly, this is more of a personal request, if there's anyone you all know, that we were unable to get ahold of to let know this reunion is happening, please take a moment to pass along word of the event, its date, and if they haven't been around since the address changed, the new one of course! Many thanks for the time and help in this from you all. This will hopefully be a day to remember of Nirvana's already colorful history!

When Mondar stole his corpse he went ballistic.  He insisted that mob does not steal corpses, etc..  You know how he is.  A group of players offered to kill Mondar for him, and he turned on them and cussed at them, telling them they were only in it for the exp.  He then logged off.  The group did kill Mondar, and left Whitehawk's possessions lying on the ground there.  Whitehawk logged back in tonight.  Mj told him that he can go get his stuff before reboot because they killed Mondar.  Whitehawk immediately cussed out Mj on the star line, called him a "fag boy", and said he takes orders from no one.  Mj attempted to explain that he was not giving orders, but Whitehawk was very nasty about it, and then logged out again.  I realize that we are all familiar with Whitehawk's tantrums. I let you know about this one because I sent him a message letting him know that Mondar does indeed steal corpses, and it was not a bug.  I furthermore informed him that he would be sorry if he ever spoke to one of my children that way again.  I would not condone him speaking to anyone that way after the person told him, but I'm sure he will see this as outright favoritism and complain to you. Perhaps I should have worded it differently, and told him he'd be sorry if he talked to people that way again, because it's harassment, as well as being not at all nice.  But due to the way I worded it, I thought I better warn you there may be an upcoming tirade. rl 20 him speaking to anyone that way after the person helped him, but I'm **rumplemintz** Re:   WhitehawkCc: (To: star) mizan,rumplemintz,boltarDate: Dec  4 14:57I really have no problem if he wants to act that way, as I see it as venting, but using cuss words on a public channel besides risque is illegal (even the start channel).  So you could do something about that.  But threatening for RL legal stuff such as harrassment just doesn't seem to fit.  If he wants to be a douche, then I think he should be allowed to be a douche.  I know you're being protective of your family, and I'm not sure how I would react in the same situation, but I just feel there needs to be some separation from RL on here.  It's an escape, and is meant to be fun, for everyone.  If fun for Whitehawk is being a dbag, then so be it.  There are ways to ignore people if they are ruining your own fun.  Just brainstorming here, ignore at will  :)  **star** Re:   WhitehawkCc: (To: rumplemintz) mizan,rumplemintz,boltarDate: Dec  4 15:00I actually wasn't talking about RL legal harassment.  I'm not sure that fits here.  But I thought there was some rule about not treating others like that in the game either.  At least players always scream about it when someone treats them badly.  At any rate, I'll keep in mind the cussing on public lines rule. I wouldn't jail him for any personal reason, and if I did feel he needed something done to him, I wouldn't do it myself since it would look like favoritism.  I just didn't appreciate his actions, and I let him know it.  I let all of you know in case he decided to complain about me. **shinshi**Subj: Log in errorsDate: Dec 22 22:42When I log in as Shinshi, I get an error message that says: Bad argument 1 to >0 program: obj/player.c, object: obj/player#10190 line 1788 What?  Fred tried to fix it but he couldn't figure it out and he told me to contact you. All of my aliases are gone and I have to register, soul off, soul on, then I'm good but nothing loads on my character except for my guild object.  Thanks! **demonic**Subj: The Crash that had us down for several hoursCc: (To: fred) dragnar,rumplemintz,boltar,star,demonicDate: Dec 24 00:11I lost 300k of Bagged Mayias Bark heals cause some jackwagon screw up the game! i want to be refunded for those!

I know because I just happened to finger him for another reason.  Just after that time, he committed suicide. He is now level +42.  Somehow he dropped 14 levels from one death.  I did check the death log and it shows a loss of 2779622 exp.  I have no idea how 2.7 million drops him 14 levels.  I'm sure before you get this he will have gone out fighting again, so his exp before suicide was 34779622. Afterwards it was 32000000.  Nothing in this seems to add up..  Star **rumplemintz**Subj: RE: Shojiro has an odd issueCc: (To: star) fred,boltar,mizan,shojiroDate: Jan 21 11:56After extensive looking, it appears that Shojiro quit the Vampire guild when he had 46372829 exp. Leaving that guild incurs a penalty of 1/4 exp (among a bunch of stat losses as well). 46372829 / 4 = 11593207 And 46372829 - 11593207 = 34779622  (or level 19 +44) When he Suicided, it dropped the max 2 levels to 19 +42 - which is 32000000 XP.  Hope that clears it up.    -- Rumplemintz **rumplemintz**Subj: Wipeout WizardDate: Feb 12 00:38Wipeout wants to be a wizard again.  I don't know any different as I wasn't around for the Elysium stuff, but there's some things in various log files concerning bradmac2 @ Elysium - his email is bradmac2@yahoo.com - so I'm assuming it's the same person.  Do you recall if he was involved with Elysium and code theft, or was he just a wiz or player there?  Don't think he was very high here when he was a wiz, so not sure what he could do.  **rumplemintz** Re:   Wipeout WizardCc: Wipeout WizardDate: Feb 20 10:55He was definately Wipeout here, I'm not sure if he was a different name on reflex's mud.

I want him to work on LD more.  He's added enough to the mud to warrant the 5000.  It will also give him the same ability as me to restart the mud if necessary and such.  Also, any thoughts on a replacement 10k lvl wizard?  I'm not sure it's needed, but having 4 5000 levels, no 1000, and no 10000 seems strange. Not sure why, as the levels don't mean much or matter at that point.  Let me know  Ryan **rumplemintz** Re:   LvlsCc: LvlsDate: May 12 10:47Sounds good.  I can grant ssh (and I think you can as well)  I can write up something if you want.  Thanks!  P.S. - if you can get Tij to reply, we really need to update the ubuntu on the box.

This is Mokri.  So Rumplemintz today decided to start swearing at me after I suggested he look into the logs for an issue. This seems to be against 'help wiz_behavior'. Also taking a queue from that help file, I am mailing you as it requests. Rump decided that he also had the right to move all of my code into a directory that I cannot access, and then deleted my character .o file and dest me. He did so on both ports.  I concede that he has the ABILITY to do those things, but, again, according to the rules of wizard behavior, I believe he does not have the right to do those things just because he's in a pissy mood.  I would appreciate having my files and character restored, and Rump being told that he cannot do those things. I have coded a lot for this game, I have helped countless people learn to code (or just fixed their stuff) on this game, and I had planned on contributing more.  Thank you.  -Mokri  **rumplemintz**Subj: MokriCc: fred, illarion, dragnarDate: May 21 17:32Demoted Mokri from 100 to 60.  Hasn't been an active wizard for awhile anyway, not sure it'll make a difference.  Seems the main things he likes to code are ways to circumvent any security or logging, and to just cause issues in general.  He has talent, and is a good coder from what I can tell, so I have rethough my initial opinion as to just get rid of him.  If he would put that talent to use in coding to help out the mud, instead of coding ways to exploit it, I might have a different opinion.  But for now I just don't trust him.  **star**Subj: WhoaCc: fred,rumplemintzDate: May 23 22:50A suggestion was made tonight that Whoa's character ought to be put inactive so she doesn't get purged. I think it's a great idea, but I don't know how to do it, or if I am able.

He would use 12000 at a time so that it didn't get logged.  I only found out about it as I'm watching valid_write and such on LD to try and get it working correclty.  I then added logging for such things, and also logging for ed, rm, mv, cp, etc... calls from wiz_soul.  Noticed him changing log files.  If it would just be adding xp to the character, and registering the char as a test char (or even not!) I wouldn't have a huge problem with it, but editing log files to cover your tracks is too hackerish, and presents a bigger issue that I don't feel comfortable with.  His levels were given back last time so that he could use his skills to help with LD conversion, of which he hasn't done anything since the levels were returned.  I can produce log files of the changed logs if needed, and also the logs of the valid_write calls from ED that get sent to my screen **dragnar**Subj: MokriCc: fred,illarionDate: Sep  3 22:47Mokri deleted his core files after he was demoted. This caused clans to no longer work. He also logged in and created an object in /open/rumplemintz that in the init caused players to have negative xp, coins, and bank balance. He cloned like 10 of these objects and put them all over the mud. Luckily Sami and Mosobp were on and able to delete the FTP. files. I have restored mokri's directory but removed his .acl file for  I promoted Sami and Mosobp for taking action when no seniors were available.  I believe everything is restored and players have been patched back to normal xp levels.  I think Mokri should be banished. --Gnar **rumplemintz** Re:   MokriCc: (To: dragnar) boltar,illarion,fred,dragnarDate: Sep  4 09:52I agree.

One change that would be easy to make would be saving gear on the player when they quit. I know Boltar has been opposed  to this in the past, but unsure of the history as to why.  If you have any strong thoughts on this either way please let me know.  Also, this could be combined with some other ideas we have been kicking around like some kind of bonus for logging in on a regular basis. Thanks, --Gnar **fred** Re:   Saving items on playerCc: (To: dragnar) boltar,rumplemintz,fred,illarionDate: Oct  7 19:14I don't have a problem with it.
