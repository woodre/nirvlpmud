messages "aingeal** Re:   mistreatment?Cc: mizanDate: Oct  5 18:09Happy,I am calling a cease-fire between you and Mizan.  I asked him to release you from prison,and not to target you with spam (although please keep in mind that a few beanos at greendo not necessarily constitute being targeted with spam).  For your part, I expect you to notmention Mizan, either directly or indirectly, in any public or private tell unless you are tryingto respectfully get his assistance with something.  This conflict between the two of you appears to be escalating, and it needs to stop.  I will speak with you about this in personas soon as possible to discuss the details with you.  Keep in mind that even otherwise innocent venting or sharing one's opinion can become harassing if done repeatedly orin such a way as to target another after being asked to stop.  Neither of you is blamelessin this instance, and I believe the best way to deal with it is for both of you to cease non-essential contact, public or private, with each other.  Please let me know when you will be available to talk about this in more detail.  I look forward to resolving this issue so that you can both go back to enjoying the gamewithout this conflict.Aingeal**"
