After kill full prof. derossi, i couldnt regain his and my alias stopped working. Thought i should tell you.**francesco**Subj: Prof DeRossiCc: (To: kamui) francescoDate: Sep 11 01:29Prof DeRossi's corpse has something special........You cannot use it as a plain corpse...Read and examine evrything very carefully and you might find the key to use it efficiently.Hope you enjoyed that kill, though, a tough one.fran**beck**Subj: Change to shardak inferno spellCc: (To: laera) fakir,eurale,jaraxle,francesco,feldegast,daranath,wocket,beckDate: Sep 11 04:23Based on player abuse of the inferno spell, two players died in a row of it.After looking at it, I feel the intent of the spell is fine, but I tweaked it a bit.My changes were as follows:Made it so only pk players or people in pk area can call spell (main abuse of the spell was non pk players killing pk players with it).Reduced damage slightly...old damage was 5* (15 + random(20)).  new is 4* (15+random(20))Reduced duration slightly.  old was 90+rand(90) new is 60+rand(90).Basically the spell seems to be too powerful for cost.  Does over 100 other|fire damage per hit.Spell only costs 150-200 sps and can do unlimited damage to as many pk players present during the duration.Spell could do thousands of hps damage for that one spell cost.  Will be watching this one closer.Please mail me with questions or comments.Regards,Beck**francesco**Subj: re-orgCc: (To: numbertwo) francescoDate: Sep 14 01:56As anticipated, i completely agree with the company-like re-org you are developing.I would add only one more spot, a wiz in charge for the quests, is all.As per myself, I would apply for a position as an area approver.Those are my reasons:1) I want to contribute to Nirvana.2) I am experienced enough.3) I play long enough to fastly approve the submitted areas.4) It doesnt involve much technical skills (which is my weak point).5) It is the position which has less political issues to handle.I think that all the above fit to myself.yet, I am ready and more than happy to contribute in any other means you might think useful for Nirvana.fran**yates**Subj: Rules?Date: Oct 22 19:38Am I misunderstanding the rules?

Players will not be so proud to present these "total newbie" type, but for us as wiz, these newbies will be the best cuz they will consider Nirvana their main/home mud because they learned to mud here.We can also ask players how they feel or which do they prefer or even giving them the option to choose if they would rather have their name recorded as a recruiter ot get a material reward.I have also an idea of how we can make players evaluate the mud and what kinda questions included.

The idea is to keep all of the little day-to-day stuff away from Boltar so that he has time to do thethings he needs to do here.  The system allows serious problems orconflicts to be brought to his attention, but at the discretion of one of us.I've placed the proposed system in each of your open directoriesunder "prison" for your review.  I tried to use a bit of commonsense in who to ask to serve in the decision-making capacities,based on who appears to be here and available the most.  However,if you are not willing to do this, please let me know and I'll asksomeone else.  Additionally, if you have any suggestions on howto improve the system, please let me know -- I haven't posted anythingor made any changes to "help prison" yet pending feedback from you.Wren and I also thought it would be a good idea to keep a copy ofall written decisions (which must be mailed to the interested partiesunder this system anyway) in one common directory so that any of us canaccess them at any time.  At the moment, for lack of a better placeto put them, they can go in /open/aingeal/decisions.  At some point,we can certainly move them somewhere else if we choose.Thank you so much, and I look forward to hearing your feedback.Aingeal**puppy**Subj: The only thing that I would add is something about players not coming back on as someone else after being jailed and spamming over a public channel about the imprisonment.

Coins are what we buy the heals with, and every little bit helps. I think we should be able to get 100k in coins, instead of the usual 80k. This will allow us to get more heals that are needed for successful fighting. This will help reduce deaths to players and corpse stealing problems, because they will have more coins to buy heals and or detoxers. I see that this is a very good idea.

I did at that time tell him that it was illegaland I could not do it for him.  So he logs out Mortarion, and logs Khrell in and pulls an Ancient Ninja Katanaout of his locker, goes to the lance road and drops it off, logs out andlogs back in Mortarion and picks it up.

I'd like to clarrify where I stand, and give my side ofthe story.I'll start off by saying that I HATE the succubus mini-guild.  It is,as far as I know, the only part of the game where a player can affectanother player's character adversely, regardless of PK setting.  Yesthe sex command is dumb, and perhaps it is childish to be mad whenI lose the ability, but regardless, it is the truth.The other mini guild abilities can ALL be undone.  I point to thetie_laces command as an example.  However, there is no way to undothe command that lets a succubus remove a players balls, and ifthey don't choose to give them back to you, then you're screwedso to speak, until the next reboot.  That is, in my opinion, crap.I have no problem with them being able to cut them off, but the factthat they get posession is wrong.  It costs them 100 sps to do it,I think that if its been done, you should be able to undo it.Wolfsbane cut off my character's balls not too long ago.  I asked herrepeatedly to give them back.  I said she would regret it if she didn'tShe still refused.  And she did it a number of other times after that,once giving them to Icingdeath.So, I have called her names.  I have spit on her, and I have stolen kills.I plan to continue doing at least the latter.  However, some players seemto have taken offense at my calling her names, and have complained aboutit.  The only person I have called names has been Wolfsbane.  Anyone elsehas chosen to be an ass and stick their nose in business that is, quitefrankly, not theirs.My position is that if she walks in the room, and I choose tocall her a bitch, or spit on her, that's something between her and I.No other player BUT Wolfsbane has the right to complain about that andtell me to stop.  And I should NOT be threatened with jail if I don'twant to stop for one player or another (in reality, I think the"multiple" complaints are more likely coming from onecharacter's multiple characters.I've been good about keeping it off channels.  If asked to stop on any ofthem, I have.  But I don't think its right to demand I not call her a nameor spit on her when she walks into a room I'm in.  As far as I knowshe hasn't complained herself ONE TIME.  She has never asked me to stop.The only people who have told me to shut up or stop have been playersuninvolved in the argument, and they don't have any right or standing todo so.I'll finish by saying that if she asks me to stop the spitting and namecalling, then fine, I will.  I will also state for the record that, unlessthere is a rule against it, I do not plan on stopping the pet killing orcorpse stealing, which is perfectly legal.  But I don't feel I should have**denttle**Subj: ContinuedCc: (To: aingeal) puppy,earwax,francesco,dentDate: Apr 14 13:23which she has not.  Sorry for the length of this, but there was one morepoint I would like to make.  I think that this all could have been avoided by one of 3 changes to that damn mini guild:1.  Make the cut fixable, not permanent.  MAybe the clinic could do this?2.  When someone cuts off your balls, they should stay in your inventory.3.  Remove the ability for it to be done on a non-PK, or for a non-PKto do it.  It violates the spirit of not being PK.  Everythingelse that can be done to a player is classified as a minor annoyance;this is the only thing (that I can think of) that actually can "harm a player".That's just my two cents, from someone who has been here a LONG time.*lick*Dent(tle)**demonic**Subj: tell me what you thinkCc: demonicDate: May 13 04:16Love is forever, never fleetingMy heart beating, needing your touchSo much i have to gain, no more pain.The stain on my broken soul, has been wiped away.So my heart shall stay, Forever yours.Thru time my love for you will forever endure.Never leting a day pass by.Treasuring every moment by your side.Watching passions  flame in your eyes.Tears of joy, that i have cried.No more must I hide my heart  away.So shall i stay in the in the gold rays of you love.Truely a gift from above, The purest love.Kind and passionate, graceful as a dove.Your love, The greatest treasure.I could ever have and for this, I am Eternally glad.That i have the chance to say, I love you!Each and everyday.by noah lidke**gemini**Subj: kale area/monstersDate: May 29 11:49Francesco.Could I get a copy of one of your kale's and the kale room's.For some reason the shadow attack spells do not work on them when in the same room, and Id like to see why, I havent encountered this anywhere but in the kale area.thanks.-G**illarion**Subj: autoload issueCc: vertebrakerDate: Jul 11 19:42Fran, I've been doing some testing with your autoload object that you've hadso much trouble with, and with some objects of my own that should be loadedby my castle's reset, and I've come to the conclusion that something in/obj/treasure.c is the reason why your object isn't getting loaded properly.I don't know what it is or why, but it seems autoloads that inherit /obj/treasure.cdon't stay loaded when your castle loads them at boot.Probably Vertebraker can fix this, but in the meantime, you'll want to recode yourobject, or use your idea of having players manually clone it by going to a certainarea.Ill**sin**Subj: kazerDate: Jul 20 12:31check out /players/data/workreportit explains some of what happened last night**mizan**Subj: Devi caught with botCc: (To: aingeal) puppy,francesco,vital,boltar,khrellDate: Aug  8 16:23Khrell discovered that Devi was using a trigger, that responded to the30 minute idle disconnect message. I then echoed the fake message andrealized the command given as response was 'mon'.The file /open/mizan/botcmd.c was then injected into her inventory,and a Tiamat was cloned into the room. Each time i echoed the message,it took the 'mon' cmd and mapped it into 'kill tiamat'.

Pretty much each time the 'mon' cmd wasgiven, that was an attack to Tiamat.It should also be noted that when i realized she had returned tokeyboard - with a who2 cmd i think, that this stopped immediately :)Tiamat took her stuff also, and disposed of it.-miz**aingeal** Re:   devi deathsCc: (To: mizan) puppy,francesco,vital,boltar,khrellDate: Aug  9 21:30Mizan,Very fitting......as well as amusing.

Avant proceeded to generate a sizeable income bytriggering this. Khrell and Humble have a better idea than i do of the $$$he was generating. Swiss is the new player char that Avant created.These are hard bugs to catch. Kudos to them for getting it. Humble hadsuspected something was up, and Khrell had mentioned something was up- buti didnt get involved directly since i have not been on lately.Secondly, Avant was definitively caught swapping equipment today with Swiss.i was working on some equipment tracking code, and used Avant as a guinea pig test earlier in the day. I logged in right when Swiss was being imprisonedso was able to compare his inventory contents. Positive ID. This of course isnot his first offense. Avant/Swiss is also Ssvegeta/Southstar/Tony.As for the eq tracking code, it is interesting and should make sense onceyou see it- /players/mizan/closed/sDM.c, object-distrib.c, and object-tracker.cThanks,-mizPS, i nearly forgot. We took Avant down to L1 for now. I dont know if thatshould be his final offense but in either case this is perhaps the thirdchar we have wiped down to L1 and with no real effect as deterrent.It's your call as player affairs at this point...**aingeal** Re:   Avant/Swiss aka ssvegeta, southstar, tonyCc: (To: mizan) puppy,francesco,mizan,vital,fakir,humble,khrellDate: Aug 24 21:28Everyone,Good catch, guys!  And yes, I believe this should constitute his LAST warning, ashe has already been warned (first offense), then served time in prison (second offense)prior to the instant offense.  At this point, I am inclined to warn him that if he iscaught breaking this rule (or a similar rule) again with any character, ALL of hischaracters will be subject to deletion on sight.  I dislike taking such strong action,but lesser consequences obviously don't seem to deter him.

A highly recommended read is in/open/mizan/sep_05_2004.txt.In a nutshell, Fastkill was caught today logging in as Moby (Billy).When confronted, he lied about it. The ensuing carnage resulted inmost of Fastkill's chars being reduced to L1, as well as Billy and Moby.Largely because of both player characters general ignorance and stupiditythis was allowed to happen. Vertebraker did a lot of the heavy lifting todayand i am thankful for both his and Forbin's help. The sep_05_2004.txt filegoes into much greater detail, it's about 3K long.Fakir was witness to my first interaction with Fastkill, and can fill anyonein on the generally benign level of it. After catching him two more timesover the week trying to do the same thing, my patience wore out. Verte hungin as well, until it reached a point that nothing really good was goingto happen.This was sent just to fill everyone in, since it was a fairly crazy run-and-gunsort of situation.

I don't think it would be a good fit and it would only lead to frustration both on your part and the administrations.  We thank you for your devotion to Nirvana and encourage you to keep playing and helping improve the game from within. We will keep your application on file and the need arises, we will be in contact with you about any possibilities.  Thank you, Vital  p.s. Please consider this the decision of the game's administration and binding until such time as you are contacted concerning it again. **vital**Subj: LexiCc: (To: vertebraker) boltar,fred,forbin,fakir,francescoDate: Sep  7 18:15I've moved Lexi back into the ranks of the players. Not as a 'dewizing' per se, but as she has been 21 for many months with contributing anything to the mud. Should she decide to resume coding and contribute to the mud we will consider at that time whether to procede or not.  Her files have not been altered, pending a decision to return or remain as a player. I will instruct her to contact a senior wiz if she decides she wants to help build nirvana.  Vital **vital**Subj: Coding and DevelopmentCc: (To: lexi) vertebraker,fred,forbin,francesco,vital,boltarDate: Sep  7 18:20Lexi, As you no doubt have noticed, you levels have been reduced to where you were when you were first approved for a position on the Nirvana development team. This was an administrative decision and not one reflecting any cheating or poor behavior on your part.  Your files are intact and backed up. If you desire to actually contribute to the development and improvement of Nirvana, you will need to seek out and discuss this with the senior wizards who will evaluate your readiness and willingness to contribute to the game.  Some people just enjoy being a player more and actually feel more comfortable doing that, rather than being a developer. Thanks, Vital **vital**Subj: An OpportunityCc: (To: jareel) boltar,vital,vertebaker,fred,forbin,fakir,francescoDate: Sep 15 15:11The seniors have decided that your behavior has not been entirely consistent with the values that Nirvana strives to promote. There have been a few problems that we want to address with you and we are hoping that this will lead to an overall better understand of how to proceed.  1). Code updates need to be logged in your work report. Updating something that you are currently working on [not in the game is one thing] and can [and did] have serious side effects on the overall game.  2). Desting your player characters is not a perk or priviledge of being a wizard and should not happen. There are good reasons to dest a player, but these should generally also be noted, as it often involves something else that needs to be fixed.  3). Sharing information with players is not a good idea and can often be insidious and hard to control. You really need to watch what you say and do with regards to the Knights guild and with players who are 'concerned' over the status of Mondar.  As part of this learning opportunity, we have decided to change your level temporarily to 40, pending an evaluation period not less than 30 days and not more than 60. After that time, your position will be reviewed and steps taken to either restore your levels or determine if any further action needs to take place.  Vital **vital**Subj: demotionCc: (To: mosobp) boltar,vital,vertebraker,fred,forbin,fakir,francescoDate: Sep 15 15:54After speaking with the other seniors, we have decided that you would be better off in the realm of players in Nirvana. You have trouble following the guidelines documented in the /doc/build and on the wizard bulletin board.  You have abused bugs and what is perhaps even worse, failed to report them or take steps to have them fixed. You were given a responsibility when you were promoted to improve the game and have not held that responsibility up. Coding for the game is a privilege and not a right.  If, after a period not less than 30 days, you feel like you are once again ready to contribute to the development of the game and abide by the established rules, you may contact the seniors again and petition for sponsorship again at that time. Note: There are likely to be stipulations added before any reinstatement is made.  Vital **vertebraker**Subj: tristian areaCc: (To: fred) vital,francescoDate: Sep 23 00:16anyone want to approve tristian's area? i advise using sparkle to walk thru the descs **vital** Re:   Tristian's areaCc: vital,vertebrakerDate: Sep 24 12:03Great.

First off, all of your cells are bugged. When I tried to get to them, I got this error: Too long evaluation. Execution aborted. If I were able to get into any of them, it was dark room, no exits, and a 0. So fix those and I will go back through them.   Also, the tool I am using to go through the areas with, I am just learning. Being as your area is the first I have done, it took me a little bit to realize that alot of your rooms are the same, so if you find there are typos in one, correct the rest of them. Even if they arent on the report. =)  You can access the report here: /open/approval/tristian.txt.

Not that you care of my opinion, but I like it. =)  If you'll make the corrections noted, I will go back through the area once you are done. Remember, I may not have written every single room down because alot of them are same as others and you know to change them all if you have to correct them once. So check them close. Also length in rooms must be 70 or below. So that is written up in some of the rooms.  Let me know when you want me to go back through it. =) **sparkle**Subj: TristianCc: sparkleDate: Sep 30 21:40Ok, finished going through his area. Was my first time, so hopefully I caught stuff. I will go back through it again once he makes these changes. He did a good job in my opinion, just some typos and ruler checks.

We need to *eventually* go thru the quests and update them, remove the crappy ones [like Heroin's], and also try to tie in multiple areas to some of the quests so they are not so boring.  In any case, I talked to Bolts about insta-wizzing long-term players who haven't had any problems.  He is cool with it. I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions.  Secondly, what the rule will be is that we all have tro agree to candidates by unanimous approval.

The concept of setting up some 'classes' or sessions for 'wax, myself and others to present topical information to interested wizards and record the series to use as later training as well. Somewhat akin to the old Descarte@TMI files, we could cover various topics that we consider 'essential' and later ones that are more esoteric but useful for those developers that don't have the benefit of our ability to crash the mud in a quick and efficient fashion.  To that end, please think for a few seconds about what kinds of topics you would like to see covered and pop me a mail back about them. 'wax and I will try to collate some kind of list and come up with a schedule for the classes and what we can cover.

This is what I found:  eastroad1: -The- which begins the 2nd sentence needs to be capitalized.   /players/jaraxle/3rd/alt/rooms/eastroad2.c : Village shore is mentioned two times in one sentence. Leave out the 2nd village shore and make it end at shoreline so it isnt repetative.   /players/jaraxle/3rd/alt/rooms/eastroad3.c : begins to is said twice. Please remove one.   /3rd/alt/rooms/sun_ally, sun_ally2 : these rooms seem fine to me. I find no typos and such in them.   Hope this helps a bit. The descripts are a bit blah, but it depends really on everything else that might be in the area.

I wanted to mail you about the new area that Angel is trying to get approved. He said that you mentioned not approving it until there were mobs put in. I talked to Earwax because I thought that areas put in simply for housing did not need mobs in them. He agreed with that and said there are already some areas in the game made just for housing that do not include mobs.  Is there a reason there would need to be mobs in the housing areas? I need to know for future reference also because if that is the case I will know not to pass any areas to you for final approval if there are no mobs.  Just wanted to check with you on this also. Seems to me that having mobs in the housing areas would only add more trouble than their worth because of people teleporting in and out of their housing area.

This time it was the same bug as Earwax had nailed him earlier exploiting.  The dervish can offwield (as you know) and it is offset by not being able to use a shield.  Yet he was wearing a full death set of armor (armor, gloves,  amulet, misc, helmet, boots, and shield) while wielding and offwielding two Iron Death Blades.  Since I'm not a PA and none were here or unidle, I issued him a warning.  But am also sending this report to you.  He is also a well established bug abuser and rule breaker.

As not mor ethen two minutes ago I noticed he was yet AGAIN doing the exact same thing.  It is not like he has not been given fair warning.  It really bothers me that there are never any PAs around when he is doing this, and it is  not very fair to players who follow the rules and are not abusing any sort of bugs or exploits in code.

Instead, they can provide special  abilities, protection values outside of ac, damage specials, etc -armor to be classified by its weight/ac ratio with the following categories:  Body Armor:    Categorization           AC  Weight    clothing/nonprotective -  0    1    light                  -  1    2    medium                 - 2-3  2-6    heavy                  - 4-6  4-8   Shields:    nonprotective          -  NA   NA    light                  -   1   1    medium                 -  2-3  2-3    heavy                  -  3-4  3-6   Head/Arms/Hands/Legs/Boots:    nonprotective          -   0   1    light                  -   1   1    medium                 -  1-2  2    heavy                  -  2-3 2-3 **earwax**Subj: Worn gear proposal part 2Cc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,fakir,forbin,stardream,pavlikDate: Mar 29 02:28 -Max ac items will not carry specials except in extreme circumstances, which  should fit the following criteria: rarity (no more than 1/3 chance of being  cloned), extremely dangerous mob, probably in a PK area, and being limited in  some manner as to levels or who can wear it. -Legacy gear will be automatically adjusted, due to absence of a flag to be  set in future armors, to appropriate weight based on the ac, type, and if it  has a special or not. -Armor will set a restriction level in living.c, which guilds can query, so   they can set appropriate penalties for using heavier gear than they allow. -The range of carry capacity will be adjusted - lower chars having far more  capacity than they currently have.  Strength will account for much, but a   total noob (level 1, str 10) will be able to carry reasonable gear. -The accessory items will have 0 ac in ALL cases.  Specific adjustments can be  made for special items like the e-gear, etc.  In those cases, it will be   magical protection, meaning based on specials and dtype (physical allowed)  protections.  AC will mean armor class though, and nothing that isn't armor  will have Ac. -We should implement better item statting.  I'm 100% in favor of allowing   players to have full stats (minus special information) on gear.  See below. -Randomization to some extent of gear stats.  In other words, something that  grants 10% magical protection should actually grant 5% +- random(5).  This  will make the best stuff more unique, and in combination with allowing the  players full statistical knowledge, will help us create an actual economy. -An auction system.  Taking advantage of the above steps, combined with the  forced diversity that this system will foster - between guild reqs, armor  restriction/encumbrance levels/randomness/knowledge - will foster major   progress in moving toward a cap-less and full economy. -Gear-induced stat modifiers.  This will go more hand-in-hand with possible  future races and stat changes.  Not as important right now, but it should be  kept in mind. -Narrower range of item values.  Shit worth 200k is foolish. **boltar** Re:   Worn gear proposal part 2Cc: (To: earwax) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,fakir,forbin,stardream,pavlikDate: Mar 29 21:16  sounds ok provided you all want to do the work.   pav's thought is much along lines of the one I had reading it.

Anyways as players gain a level they gain perhaps 5 attrib points to distribute as they wish, perhaps a random stat will raise automatically each level.  Max for each stat will be 30, to conform with current standards; each race however, will have different maxes for each stat, with 30 being the ceiling.  Stats will be more in control of a char's power than level, but they gain stats through levels and xlevels.  Currently I don't have anything planned for gaining stats in any way other than level, although that may change.  strength:     damage bonuses in combat, carry capacity dexterity:    chance to hit in combat, dodge, parry, skills etc constitution: hp, hpr (regen rate), endurance points, epr willpower:    innate resistances, willpower type checks, has an effect on ep mental:       sp/spr, int/wis checks  racial, static stats: they either don't change, or aren't controlled by char: luck:      they can 'roll' this stat at char generation charisma:  also roll this at char generation, within limits set by race size:      this will go up as they level, until they reach their max size            also a rolled stat  Specifics:  HP: 10* con + 2*level + 2*xlevel      7  con at level 1  means 72  max hp - higher than now     30 con at level 19 means 338 max hp - about equivalent to now  SP: 10* men + 3*level + 3*xlevel      7  men at level 1  = 73      30 men at level 19 = 357   EP: 7*con + 3*wil + 2*level + 2*xlevel  HPR: racial modifier + con hp regen per minute, max of 60 SPR: racial modifier + men sp regen per minute EPR: racial modifier + 2/3 con + 1/3 wil  current stat checks will be routed to the most appropriate stat  Implementation: these won't go fully into the game for general players until this stuff has been thoroughly tested and races, gear changes, skills are ready to go in as well, but they will be the first in for testing. **fakir**Subj: changesCc: (To: vertebraker) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 17 21:18I may not be on track here, but I find myself wondering how the current proposed changes (which are many and fairly complicated) will be introduced into a game that has, for the most part, had its parameters in place for a good long time.  We have players (at least a few still) who will be confused....or feel 'out of it'.  If the game is going to be changed to a large extent, would it not be better to make an 'alt' mud, change it up, and then let people log in and try it out?  I also wonder how in the world the mud will support races, guilds, clans, etc....when we have barely enough ppl playing to make the mud viable as it is.  I am not trying to be negative here...just wondering if all this 'patch work' on Nirvana is for its overall good...or if it will alienate more players.  We have already lost some decent players due to changes...just something to think about.  Again, I am not trying to rain on a parade, just wonder how it all meshes together and works out. * * **earwax**Subj: initial race guidelinesCc: (To: vertebraker) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 19 08:30Race Guidelines  Players have the following attributes:  Strength Constitution Dexterity Willpower Intelligence  They have the following racial attributes: Luck Charisma Size  They also have the following racial modifiers to their regen rates: Racial HPR Racial SPR Racial EPR  When creating a race you should consider as a starting point 120 total attrib points for the main 5, with luck and charisma being 20.  No stat should be above 35, and never should a race have 2 stats at 35.  If charisma or luck are raised or lowered you should subtract/add half that amount to the base  attribute pool.  When putting points into stat maxes, you should consider the following:  35: Extremely high 30: Very high 25: High 20: Normal 15: Low 10: Very Low 5:  Extremely low  Racial regeneration rates should be thematic for the race, and stats should be balanced accordingly.  In other words, if you grant high regeneration rates to a race, the overall stats should be lower.  Another aspect to consider is innate resistance levels to dtypes, special  abilities, nightvision, innate disadvantages, etc.  Everything that goes into a race should be considered balance-wise versus the other races.  Ideally, we will have no one dominant race.  Every player can decide whether they would rather have innate resistances, high stats, high regen rates, or whatever.  Also keep in mind that this is purely an initial 'guess' as to how races  should be balanced.  Once we have figured out some races a better system can be devised. **earwax**Subj: attribsCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 20 08:05I was planning on taking the variables and funs out of player.c that are used for attribs, having it inherit the file - to make it easier to work on ...

This is stuff I've had floating  around in my head for quite a while, so I want to make sure I respond as  clearly as possible.  For starters:  Nirvana is a dying MUD.  I don't know that anyone wants to hear or accept this, but it's a fact.  If you look at Nirvy over the last what,  four, six, eight, ten years, it's steadily losing playerbase.  One or two  fewer players average per night, per year, perhaps, but it's dying.  What's  happing is we're not attracting or retaining new players, and gradually the  older players develop real-lives, or are kicked in the ass by their RLs.  They don't return, and we're not gaining new players at the same rate we lose them. This is a slow attrition, but it's a fact of life.  This is the reason, plain and simple for trying to introduce any changes all - to reverse this.  Now, the older players are going to leave - in my own case, I've burnt out at times, and the eight or nine years I was gone from here were due to real-life. I'm a returned player, and yes, this happens fairly often.  It doesn't happen often enough to compensate for the loss of players.  In any case, there's no mud in existance that doesn't lose players - to the MMORPGs like WoW and Everquest, or whatever, to girlfriends, wives, kids, prison (heh), the USMC, or military service in general, rl in general, or whatever.  This is a fact  of life for any MUD.  The key is to replace those players with new ones.  This is an ancient MUD.  I actually enjoy working on this MUD for that reason. I'll bitch and moan and gripe as much as anybody else about things that don't work like they should, if at all, and the pain in the ass it is to change  anything, but I've had a long history here, and the administration and pbase has as well.  This is something you can't replace, period.  The problem is that it's ancient in its systems.  Combat is clunky and obsolete, the chars  all use the same gear, there's no individuality, and syntax here is simply incomprehensible to most.  I am, usual flap aside, an extremely competant  player, and recently I've brought over one of the best players from another MUD, and he's had the same thoughts that I did learning this game:  it's  simply too piecemeal, the syntax isn't consistent enough, it's too simple in some areas (player creation, lack of races, etc) and too ridiculously complex in others: clunkiness of the save system, the weird exceptions for attribs,  hell, who thinks to type 'help attribs' - the inferior help file system, etc. **earwax** Re:   changesCc: (To: fakir) vertebraker,vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 21 06:47I've been thinking over these issues for years, and as most players and  developers here are aware, I've been gaining input on one topic or another almost continuously during my time.  I don't have all the answers, so I seek  them out from others.  What the problems boil down to is the following:   Poor noob interface:  they are clueless, they don't gain appreciably in     power, they don't know what makes them more powerful - levels, stats,      etc, they don't understand the game.  Noob areas are all over the place,     some of them aren't truly noob areas, noobs can't carry even minor gear,      syntax is a nightmare, and we don't have a really professional or modern     looking interface, in general.   We're very limited.  Combat is ridiculously repetitive.  It's too      simplistic, the only things to consider are healing and making sure to use     your one spell per round.  There's no variance, it's just different guilds     with different commands.  Use aliases, it's all the same guild.  I know     this sounds harsh, and some of you might argue, but the fact is, that's      what it all boils down to.  If you really want to argue the point, send me     a tell or mail.   Every player basically the same.  There's very little variance in the high     end gear or chars.  They all max all stats eventually, they all use the     same gear when they can get it, etc.   Guilds make no sense.  Why does my bcm have no differences in combat than a     knight other than emotes?  A knight should be physically-oriented, the     mage more magical.  There's entire essays to be written about this subject     but I'm cutting it off here.   Saved items:  this is terrible.  Most chars can't even store their base     slots - of which there are too many, admittedly.  My bcm can store most     but not all of the gear - ALL OF WHICH - he equips generally.  It's also     very confusing and difficult to grasp for new chars, and primitive by the     standards of most modern, high player-base muds.   Gear makes no sense.  It's obvious what's the best - the lightest, max ac     item that has the best specials.  If you don't see the problem with this,      then you don't need to be reading this at all, stick to playing the game.   Pk pointless: there's actually a lot to be written on this, but the core      issues are being addressed by verte and me, and there's a large-scale     project going on by pain, jenny, me, other wizards for that as well.   Misc issues: not going into them here, but there's a lot heh :)  This leaves the solutions and the reasons for them as the next topic.  What  I'm trying to do first is to streamline the attributes - we currently have 10 that some of which do things, some don't, some depend, nobody knows.  What's the tradeoff between spending exp on levels or stats or guild?  Those are too difficult of questions for noobs to be considering.  Let's streamline this and let them know exactly what each stat is responsible for, let's make them go up each level, so they can focus on tradeoffs between guild levels and spending exp on levels.  **earwax** Re:   changesCc: (To: fakir) vertebraker,vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 21 06:47Next topic is races:  every player is currently the same.  This is boring,  it's foolish for balance, and irritating for players and guilds.  Let's put in some true graces, some true differences, let players choose and customize  their chars on a fundamental level.  Skills.  This is one of my major goals.  The skill system I'm working on implementing is the single-most addictive system I've ever seen.  It's similar to the old warrior guild, but it's even more intuitive.  It makes sense, it facilitates things for guilds, and makes guildless chars viable.  My main  interest is addicting new players - when they see their skills shooting up  from the first fight they are in, and continuing to raise, it gives them a sense of accomplishment.  This is important for retaining noobs.  Gear.  This is essential for everything else, and it's going to be unpopular initially, but it's a simple necessity for guilds and skills.  The last topic is the problems.  My single biggest debate with myself on this is, does this change the fundamental nature of Nirvana.  Well, what I've  finally come to decide is that yes, it does, and no, it's not a bad thing.   Like I said, Nirvana is dying.  One can deny this or refuse it, or close their eyes to it, but the fact is Nirvana is declining.  Something needs to be done, and that something is modernization.  My goal plain and simple is to increase the playerbase.  The ways to do this are to simplify the mud's syntax, make it's core commands more professional in appearance, enhance the help files,  make learning the mud more intuitive, and most importantly, ADDICT them.  In any case, I'm sorry this runs so long, I've actually tried to keep it as brief as possible.  If there's a subject anyone wants elaboration on, I'll be happily to provide it, but I'd ask that they talk to players, talk to newbies, look at the game as a newbie, remember what it was like when you were a newbie and just look at this with an open mind.   *  **earwax** Re:   changesCc: (To: fakir) vertebraker,vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 21 06:52To answer the question from an implementation standpoint: I'm doing this piecemeal, just a bit here, a bit there, and I've  been talking to players more or less nonstop on this.  I have an  open invitation for them to 'beta' these changes, and I'm making an extreme effort to keep them in the loop.  From a code end, well, it's a pain in the ass, plain and simple. I'm going to have everything legacy supported of course - that's  what makes this a pain in the ass.  I'd actually now rather do this stuff this way rather than on an alt mud, simply because they can see the progress, and it's less to learn for any given player.    It will be less of a shock this way, it will be gradual, and most of the players will pretty much know what's going on, plus for  every 'nerfing' that happens, it can be balanced with a positive.  Anyways, I'm handling the code-end, and I can elaborate on exactly what I'm doing if you're really that interested. **fred**Subj: Symbio / AmiroCc: (To: stardream) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: Apr 29 15:05Hey all.  I had talked to Symbio about the whole Amiro thing before Forbin jailed them both.  I knew Amiro was Symbio's  alt character and he freely admitted it to me and said that he gave the char away to Sunim.  I first questioned him because I thought he was multiplaying (using both chars).  After he told me that he had given the character away I informed him that well that was also illegal.  He said he wasn't aware of that and asked if I could let it slide this once.  After some thought I told him that I would let it go for "now" and that if too many people had a problem with it that something would have to be done about it.  I wasn't sure how many people actually knew that Symbio was Amiro and lets face it it wouldn't take long to party someone up to lvl 19 so I thought that if players didn't scream about it and it got two established mudders here to start playing again I was willing to let give it a try.  But like I mentioned earlier I did inform him that if it did cause problems it would have to be addressed.  Fred **stardream**Subj: symbio/amiroCc: (To: fred) vertebraker,earwax,illarion,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlikDate: Apr 29 15:26I already received a player complaint from worm about it, I dunno if that counts or not heh SD **stardream**Subj: symbio/amiroCc: (To: forbin) earwax,fakir,pavlik,fred,vertebraker,illarion,francescoDate: Apr 30 14:17After giving this matter some thought, I am inclined to feel that Forbin is right about the whole situation.  I think that it has been a long standing rule that people cannot character share.  If Sunim wants to create another character then he should do that, rather than taking one  from someone else.  Players have been jailed in the past for this, and as Worm of all people pointed out, this has always been our policy.  Worm has been jailed before for giving his characters away, and I feel its unfair to all of those players who have also been  told they cannot share characters with another person for us to make an exception for Symbio who has a tendency to try to work the system when it suits his needs.  I highly doubt he didn't know that he couldn't give away his characters, as he was friends with Worm when Worm was jailed for it.   Anyways, if it doesn't take that long to get to level 19, then there's no real reason to share that character anyways because its only a matter of a little time before sunim could level his own characters up to that level why make an exception just because they are established mudders, if anything, I'd think you'd want to make an  exception for a player giving the character to a non-established player, who needs the help more.   Anyways, that's just what I think, ultimately I'll leave the decision up to Fred or Earwax or Verte to decide.   oh, and just one more thing, like Forbin asked, next time if you think about it, please let someone know when an  exception like this is being made so that we don't  gripe at players over something that's already been settled Thanks, SD **vertebraker**Subj: bug reportDate: May  1 12:561   Reports for: /players/francesco/univ/rooms/dimec13  Apr 13 19:05 :: sephiroth     I have the ID on me  but when i 'ask marian' she says I don't have it **earwax** Re:   why is oz deguilded?Cc: (To: vertebraker) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,stardreamDate: May  2 23:02He's a moron.  He's been causing nothing but issues, I've personally seen him flapping and instigating and antagonizing over and over,  he's had a long history of this crap.  I sat him down before and gave him a very explicit warning.  In no uncertain terms I informed him that if there was a future problem with him I would take action, at the very least, resulting in his removal from the guild.  Then I come to find out, between talking to Salina, Squint, and Mosh, and reading the log that Salina conveniently had, that he's getting stupid again. Further, recently he was flapping at other chars while I was on, including myself.  I didn't take action at the time, figured bah,  whatever, this is minor stuff.  Then I read the logs for knights and see him criminaling mosh multiple times, see him lying in at least one instance in the criminal logs, from a few months ago, and see him giving himself awards as well.

If you wish to know what I am talking about, read some of the mails he has sent me.  Personally, I like the mud the way it is. I don't want to change it. I have no intention of dancing to some tune Earwax feels like playing on his flute. I do not, nor never have abused wizard powers. I occasionally snoop a player, but never when two players are in a room or chatting. And, I usually (almost always) tell a player if and when I am snooping them and also when I turn snoop off.  Its absurd that Earwax even brings that into a conversation about being a wizard.   Personally Boltar, I am sick and tired of his heavy handed way of dealing with things...and it's my opinion you are going to have a dead mud very soon because of it.  I will not tolerate someone who threatens, cajoles, and is otherwise a dick.   It is true I do not contribute to the mud much, other than the areas I did code and are in play.  However, I have never seen my contribution here to be one of code.  Wizards come and go...power hungry, unstable wizards have come and gone.  In almost every case where there has been an abuse of power, or a lack of good judgement, I have had a hand in resolving that issue...in some way or another.  And, I might add, you have usually backed me up in most of the disputes I have had some involvement in.  I don't really care what Earwax does. I do not have the juice, nor the time, nor really the interest anymore to try and corral his over-bloated ego...I suspect that issue, if its dealt with, will have to rest with you. apply sphere to being a wizard here...I've had a good run. I have enjoyed the game, and enjoyed for the most part the people I have met here.  If the current gestapo Earwax does indeed have his way and dewizes me, so be it.  Even though he feels otherwise, I still think I contribute something to the game...but as always, I will leave that up to you to decide. I am way too old and way to long in the tooth here to care much what some bully wizard dictates to me as being 'his way or the highway'.  Do you really want someone like this in charge of things to the point you give him THAT much authority?  Vert NEVER had an ego like Earwax. He NEVER abused any wizard power. He never, once he became a wizard, cheated the game. I cannot say the same for Earwax.  There is a WORLD of difference between Vertebraker and Earwax as far as Admin goes.  Personally, if Earwax is in charge, I don't want to be a wizard here. * **fakir**Subj: dewizzingCc: (To: earwax) boltar,vertebraker,fred,illarion,francesco,forbin,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Oct  7 19:33You do what you wish...or rather...whatever B lets you get away with.  Personally, I'd bump you back to a level more fitting of your mental capacity and temperament, but unfortunately, we don't have wizards in the negative level category.  If you continue to travel the path you are currently walking, you will have a very dead mud.  I can almost guarantee it.  Further, I don't give a SHIT what you think, want, or do.  I lost all respect for you as a wizard when I caught you cheating with triggers.  You should have been de-wizzed then, and you should not be a wizard in charge of diddly shit now.

Whatever I'm allowed to get away with.  Personally I'd rather not make decisions, I'd rather just code, that's what I'm good at and what I enjoy.  Babysitting a bunch of grown adults does nothing but irritate me and make me less productive.  I like to figure out  problems and code solutions to them.  This is my enjoyment, and it's the surrogate challenge for me, since the game is simply too easy as a player.  Now, the shit with the triggers, you yourself said and know that it wasn't like it was beneficial to me.  I was dealing with  exhaustion pure and simple.  But that's beside the point, I did what I did, but it still pales in comparison to your own abuses.  I made a mistake, you made repeated mistakes, and more than that, you haven't done anything positive for the game in years, and you have worked hard to be negative.  You bitch, but offer no solutions nor put forth any work.  The work I've done in one single object alone is more than your sum total of code in this game, ever, not to mention the simple fact that it's years beyond your comprehension or POTENTIAL level of  improvement.    If we want to get into specifics, I've done my best, other wizards have as well, to get you involved with improvements in the game.  Instead,  you're content with a slow death over the years, a slow reduction in playerbase each year, until this mud dies, whereas I'm doing everything I can to get as much influence from players and wizards to come up with solutions.

The bottom line is that you spend your time on as a wizard griping and using the snoop command.  I spend mine coding and teaching others and encouraging others and administrating.  This is not even an implication, it's  simple fact.  The logs, the inherits and bug logs and everything else and every wizard on here, pretty much, speak for this, without me having to, yet you want to have a pissing contest.  How about this, put up, shut up, and have a positive impact other than resting on a single, minor area, you did however many years ago, with no positive impact since, instead of trying to put down my efforts.  Ego?  You're real funny, since you aren't even a competant builder, talking about someone that is a highly competant coder, that is doing their best to incorporate the ideas of everyone playing and coding for the game, especially where you just gripe and offer no solutions or work.  When you actually make a contribution open your mouth.

I take responsibility for not being socially  good enough myself to keep a peace and get people to work good enough  together. but the fact remains that unless we complete some serious  rennovations the mud will just slide into obscurity.   Since there is no one else to do it. All conflicts between wizards  will be resolved by me. Odds are everyone involved will hate my solutions so I advise living and let live as much as possible and don't do things that you know are going to result in conflict or displine or even questionable if you're seen/caught doing them.   I need productive people right now, not squabbles. Everyone needs to add something positive. I can't have people that just exist to cause conflict because they find it entertaining to do so. I don't need people getting pissed off at every little thing. What the mud needs, what I need for the mud are productive people.  It's that simple. And before there is any more squabbling, ask yourself where you(individuals) are on that, and that is the squabbling going to  lead to anything positive or just piss people off so we get even more  short handed?   I'll leave it at that.   -Bp  **wipeout**Subj: MASTERMIND- bugged?Date: Nov  6 23:21i was playing tough, and on my 5th turn i had 4 in the correct place and one out of place... how is that possible? thanks wipe **wipeout**Subj: mastermindDate: Nov  6 23:324 times that happened... 3 on tough and 1 on easy.. all solved within the allotted guesses.... but just said all but one were in place, and the remaining was out of place btw, i did your mech. engineering quest. /wink wipe  **vertebraker**Subj: should do a...Date: May 22 15:59you should do a learn italian area. **chip**Subj: IMPORTANT REQUEST!Cc: (To: vertebraker) x,fred,earwax,khrell,sami,wipeout,subotai,jenny,jareel,jaraxle,jara,fakir,mosobp,mizan,sparrow,star,sparkle,jamila,kasia,demonic,springdawn,cooper,sundin,worm,katya,bella,viper,feldegast,snow,symbio,whitehawk,lostsoul,artos,achilles,doodle,recca,deacon,dustyrose,rek,vahiti,griswold,hugh,oghma,tristian,francesco,eurale,breeti,coglin,brittany,armblessed,third,armadillo,zeus,wtknight,cobain,haze,pavlik,mythos,arrina,llew,hawkeye,airwoman,trixDate: Jan 30 01:09We are trying to liven Nirvana back up, please at least consider making a return!

LD has such a huge advantage for coding it's ridiculous.  Anyway, just don't want this to get stale, so we should make some sort of decision.  --Rump **"
