messages "caravelle**Subj: Scathe/NoirceurCc: (To: mizan) caravelleDate: Aug  4 04:50Let me be one of the first to say thinks. Although I am not female, I have had to deal with his 'crap' for many years on here. At one point (for some reason) a large percentage of the females on here asked to be married to one of my chars. (thus my 30 chars) Once that happened he started pitting them against me by saying things to them about me. I know this because a couple of them told me he said things, they just knew better than to believe him. I also had to deal with 'Someone' kicking me over nad over from afar, which didn't take much to figure out who it was, and also the fact the he use to make mention of my alts to others, even if they were JUST created. It was impossible for me to keep a charachter secret. Which was one of the reasons I had to take off from here for awhile in the past. At times I just wanted to be left alone, and it couldn't be done.AAlthough some won't understand what has gone on in the past many many years, I do....and I truely do thank you and the rest of the people that finally decided to make this descision. You may be a hardass and have a bizarre sense of humor :oP, but it's all for the best :o)Caravelle/Sundin/Wakaluk/Nighttime/Adonis/Jericho/Wonka/Chelios/Dw/Braxxus/many many others :o)**mizan** Re:   Scathe/NoirceurDate: Aug  4 13:32I appreciate you letting me know about some of the crap that shitfuckerScathe was pulling. Although Boltar is a generally forgiving person, scathegot the point where even B had the attitude of 'dont let the door hit youon the way out while verte tosses you' etc.There is no intention of letting him back, and even his player chars willbe subject to wizard whims. Also as a heads up, some of his alts areVartanian and Immarheen. I will be coding something that outs his charsonce he is identified. And you are right, i dont think i can truly understandwhat kind of crap he had been doing. I don't snoop other wizzes, or theirchars- and i make a point to avoid people in hotel rooms unless there issomething very specific (i.e. game cheating) going on, so i really amoblivious in that regard. But he was really the only true bad offender imho as a wiz. If anyone is stilldoing this kind of crap i would really appreciate it if you would mail theplayer affairs wizzes (puppy, aingeal, francesco) or even myself if you hearabout it... thanks again!-miz**"
