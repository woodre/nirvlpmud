She's reposting this every few hours on her wall, and getting a lot of people commenting that they're worried for her safety, and people who say they'll be on the lookout, and that they unfriended and blocked you..  etc.  I'm not sure if this can or will get you into trouble, but she has pretty much accused you of a crime and has posted for all to see that you have more than one account..       STALKER ALERT! A so called friend is stalking me and now my       facebook friends as well! His name is Bill Stacey and he now       is stalking me with another account under the name of Jason       Hall (from Missouri). If he has befriended you please defriend       and block him ASAP!!!! Thank you  Kat **fred**Subj: HehCc: QDate: Feb 22 10:23If you still around for more than 3 minutes I'd get to you :P   Fred **fred**Subj: double hrmmDate: Feb 22 10:24Better yet just 'page fred'  I'll hear the little ding and figure it out.  Fred **jeanyus**Subj: Alumni RoomCc: jabroniDate: Mar  1 19:38From Green: 4w 5n enter portal wings e 2s enter door 3up out 2e open door enter door e Ted Lindsay has skates and is 220-300k (mind the huge variance) Ac 2 with offensive special Terry Sawchuck is 220-280k and has the blocker (gloves) ac 2 with defensive specials at 30%(don't quote me on that but it's some low percentage) of total hp or below  Sid Abel and Vladimir Kostovonovovnovnovnonvovnov are both 70-90k All the doods with bottles on them are around 30k if they aren't the ones named above.
