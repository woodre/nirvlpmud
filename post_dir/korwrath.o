Anyway, if you are still interesting in joining the Samurai, you must write Valen with the reasons you would make an honorable one. You must also cc: a few Shoguns as well.  I know some are not on often but here are a few:  myself, donkey, tirnok, and decimis If Valen accepts you he will ask you a few things about the bushido code and here is a website that will give you insight on Samurai'. I will paraphase as much as possible of the Bushido code:  Rectitude - integrity to the code Courage - to stand up to enemies Benevolence - Lending a hand to the weak and meek Respect - everyone even your enemies, a bow is appropriate behavior Honesty - Always speak the truth Honor - Avenging yours and a friends death Loyalty - Always be loyal to your friends and fellow Samurai  So good luck and if there is anything else I can help you with please let me know.  Warm regards Chiele  **"
