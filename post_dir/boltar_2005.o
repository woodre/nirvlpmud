I moved /obj/prego.cto work on something, and reboot happened with out it backin place. The file is backed up in:    /obj/vital.bak/prego.20040525.cAll of the changes to player.c made so far do not changethe functionality or remove any of the other functionsin them. The bulk of the savings is in changing the waythat player.c accesses some of the functions. And it willmake any future problems easier to track down and anyimprovements easier to implement.Before I would even suggest using anything from thedevelopment server, I would outline and documentthe changes and the reasons they were made. I amworking under the expectation that I can make themud a better place overall. One last thing, if I had limited shell access, I couldquickly restore the backup files. I only suggest thatbecause it seems to be a problem.Vital**tyr**Subj: ?Date: May 26 18:35I was just informed that I am not allowed to wizhere because I used to wiz at elysium...

Two characters that i had mistakenlyidentified to be part of Tony/Southstar/Ssvegeta's were demoted experienceand simply put, it was a case of mistaken id based on fuzzy information.Gogeta had 1873448 EXP at login, and now has 85.Fury had  2636960 EXP at login and now has 1 exp.I owe these two characters:1) A full reimbursement of EXP.2) Equipment (a substantial amount- about 100K coins worth in heals   weapons, and others. I know what was lost so i would rather deal with   this aspect directly (so you guys dont have to).3) Most importantly, an apology.Simply put, i fucked up. I take full responsibility for it because of mybad notes- nobody else made a decision on this except for myself. I hadexpressed doubts on channel wiz that Fury/Gogeta were being used bySouthstar/Tony/Ssvegeta but in the end- it was my call and i got it wrong.Gogeta/Fury, i am truly sorry for what happened and it was just a totallybad mistake on my part. I jumped the gun on it and fucked up. REPEAT nobodyelse was involved- this was my poor decision based on already fuzzy info.Viper did clear things up however. To think that something as stupidas an illegible 'equals sign' was what did it.In either case if anyone gets this while i am not on, andGogeta/Futy is present please patch him up with EXP if it is convenient.Don't worry about the equipment, that will be something i want to makeamends with.-mizan**vertebraker**Subj: expCc: (To: mizan) aingeal,boltar,gogeta,fury,viperDate: Jun 12 01:43I patched back Fury/Gogeta's exp in his pfile.**vertebraker**Subj: someone did something..Date: Jun 12 02:01someone did something.the dervish member dir is gone.

Zeus has not really been aroundfor quite awhile and when he does stop by has no realdesire to code or update his code.  I don't plan on makingany major changes to the guild by any means.  Originally as an advantage they were allowed to have mag and ste abovethe traditional 20 max.  Those were never updated since thenew attribute system was put in place so I would like to make changes for that.  Other changes I would want to do is just some minor changes to some of the powers here and thereto make them somewhat beneficial.  Compared to other guildsthe Fallen is a very hard guild to advance through.  At thistime I think there are only 8-10 maxxed chars since the guildopened I would guess like 3 years ago.  Those that are maxxeddon't play because although in my mind the guild is very strong in theme, it lacks in actual playability.  Let me knowwhat you think.

Noir did not evenmention that Scathe had been demoted, nor did I receive a mailing fromScathe about the demotion.  At any rate, I'll be happy to deal with the problem if Scathe complains aboutthe demotion (as well as the complaint about Khrell's emote), and I'llpost a full write-up in the next few days documenting this incident.  Puppy, feel free to chime in if you disagree, or have anything to add.  *grin*Thank you!Aingeal**aingeal** Re:   scatheCc: (To: vertebraker) boltar,puppy,aingealDate: Aug  1 20:29Everyone,I've had a chance to talk to Hogath, Mizan, and Khrell, but am stillawaiting a chance to talk to Stardream.  Although I want to speak with her, and with Scathe, as well as consult with Puppy about this,I am leaning toward recommending de-wizzing Scathe.  This incidentalone certainly doesn't warrant such action, but after reviewing theproblems he has caused or has been directly involved in, and consideringthe lack of other contributions he makes as a wizard (i.e. he no longercodes, he does not involve himself in player disputes in a positive manner that would help resolve them, he does not assist newer wizardsin any way, etc.), I believe that it would be in the best interest of themud to de-wiz him.  Again, I wish to speak to a few more peoplebefore making my final recommendation, and I'm sure that Puppy will want to speak to this issue as well.Aingeal**vertebraker**Subj: scatheDate: Aug  2 01:00i dewized scathe now after talking it over with the PA wizards, mizan,and the people involved in numerous disputes.. they'll mail you soonand post a note.**aingeal**Subj: ScatheCc: vertebrakerDate: Aug  2 01:14Boltar,I just wanted to give you a heads-up.  When I logged in tonight, I found therehad been (another) problem with Scathe involving Stardream, Hogath, andKhrell.  I'll fill you in on all the details later, but the upshot is that he wasagain bothering Stardream, as well as instigating trouble with Hogath andKhrell, and he ultimately ended up desting Hogath twice in a fit of anger.Stardream reported it to Mizan and to Vertebraker, and Verte demotedScathe to level 21, then notified the Players Affairs wizards of the problem,asking us to essentially assess whether the demotion was warranted andwhat, if any, other action should be taken (i.e. de-wizzing based on Scathe'slong and distinguished history of causing problems).  After questioningseveral people, the same reports of sexual harassment and generally disruptiveand abusive behavior were made against Scathe.  Again, I'll fill you in onthe details as soon as I see you, but I have some long logs of conversationswith Scathe and Stardream if you wish to see them.  Upon consulting myPlayers Affairs investigative records, it appears that Scathe / Noirceur hasbeen involved in disputes requiring PA intervention at least 4 times in thepast year, and that is in addition to the continuing pattern of harassment ofsome of the women on Nirvana.  I consulted with Mizan, Stardream, andVertebraker (Khrell was present for some of this conversation), and ultimatelycame to the conclusion that I would recommend that Scathe be de-wizzed.This recommendation was unanimously supported, and is consistent with Verte's thoughts on the matter.  Additionally, at Mizan's suggestion, weposted a note regarding Noirceur by way of apology to those he has harassedand by way of warning to women who may become involved with him.Based on all of this, Vertebraker de-wizzed Scathe tonight.  He has a history of using his wiz powers inappropriately to find out personal informationabout players, and that concerned us a great deal, lending a bit of urgencyto the situation, as he knew that this outcome was possible after talkingwith me tonight.  As I said, I'll fill you in on the whole story once you'vereturned home and have a chance to settle in.  Aingeal**aingeal**Subj: ScatheCc: (To: vertebraker) puppy,mizan,boltarDate: Aug  2 15:48Everyone,Just FYI, I received a mudmail from Scathe at 3:55 a.m. this morning askinghow he can contact me off the mud to discuss things.

I then echoed the fake message andrealized the command given as response was 'mon'.The file /open/mizan/botcmd.c was then injected into her inventory,and a Tiamat was cloned into the room. Each time i echoed the message,it took the 'mon' cmd and mapped it into 'kill tiamat'.

A highly recommended read is in/open/mizan/sep_05_2004.txt.In a nutshell, Fastkill was caught today logging in as Moby (Billy).When confronted, he lied about it. The ensuing carnage resulted inmost of Fastkill's chars being reduced to L1, as well as Billy and Moby.Largely because of both player characters general ignorance and stupiditythis was allowed to happen. Vertebraker did a lot of the heavy lifting todayand i am thankful for both his and Forbin's help. The sep_05_2004.txt filegoes into much greater detail, it's about 3K long.Fakir was witness to my first interaction with Fastkill, and can fill anyonein on the generally benign level of it. After catching him two more timesover the week trying to do the same thing, my patience wore out. Verte hungin as well, until it reached a point that nothing really good was goingto happen.This was sent just to fill everyone in, since it was a fairly crazy run-and-gunsort of situation.

Before going any further though itshould be made clear that this is not a 'normal' type of monster. It has quite a few tricks up its sleeve- the most reasonable account of whatcould have happened actually fits in with your story of what you ran into.The monster has a full heal which it casts, if it detects its hitpointsare dangerously low. The message you would have seen would have begunas:"Jikhal takes out an aged scroll and mutters a few key phrases..."All it needs is one heartbeat to do it. So if this happened more than onceit would be an anomaly, but from your account it happened once- and this isconsistent with the code. You did not run into this in the past becausemost likely you were on a roll and killed this monster before it had thechance to cast this full heal in the past.Take a look in your screen capture to see if that text appears. If so, itis the heal going off. Also to the best of my knowledge this file hasnot been changed recently...Shoot me any questions tho if there is any confusion,thanks,-miz**mizan**Subj: Fastkill (potentially good outcome though)Cc: vertebraker,pain,aingeal,puppy,francesco,wren,fred,khrell,gemini,samiDate: Sep 17 17:50Before we begin this is not the usual crimescene blotter mudmail. It has apotentially positive note.I just spoke to Fastkill (Sami) and we've come to an agreement of sorts.He will:1) Use only ONE player character for this time forward.2) Try to keep a low profile from conflicts on channels and stuff.3) Immediately identify himself (hi, i am fastkill) if a wizard speaks to   him or is trying to figure out what is going on.In turn i will:1) Leave him alone. (basically this is me, following his rule #2)2) Be responsive to him if he has any questions or game issues3) Try to get other wizards to also follow his rule #2 as well.The contents of our conversation lives in /open/mizan/fastkill-meeting.txt.He wants to play by the rules, so i figured it would be best to give him a structured chance to do so.

I fixed that, but he was still more valuable than icingdeath,who is a lot harder to kill.The reason for that is his insanely high hit points (10000).  I noticed thaticingdeath actually has a negative hp_bonus, which made me realizethat after a certain point, higher hp doesn't make a monster that muchmore difficult.  After playing around with the numbers quite a bit, I cameup with a method that puts icingdeath around the same value it is nowwithout the negative hp bonus, and also puts duncan at a reasonablelevel (albeit somewhat higher than he was previously)The new formula is implemented into ~illarion/test/living.cI also changed ~illarion/test/monster.c so that weapon_class andarmor_class (the variables) are updated properly, and added anoption to where armor could be made to NOT count toward a monster'sexp value (for the purposes of spells that lower ac, etc)Both files were copied fresh from /obj before I started fiddling with them.**mizan**Subj: this 'whine' ranger business.Cc: (To: tyr) stardrifter,boltar,beckDate: Dec  3 13:39For the record, i didnt patch your ranger to be 'whine' colored.I dont really know who did this, but its been something rumbled abouton random wiz channels. Until you logged in yesterday i had no ideawhat this was really about.Anyhow, you seem to think that i am responsible for this. I can categoricallysay that i am NOT involved, despite what you think, and what you have beentelling everyone who will listen.I DID kill the ranger command center, on a completely unrelated note butthis happened some time ago and has no bearing on this issue at hand. Whatelse can be said?I categorically deny setting your player character to be the ranger 'whine' color.100% not involved, no mizan involvement whatsoever.This was brought to my attention by stardrifter.-miz**mizan**Subj: sponsorshipCc: (To: tyr) boltar,pain,mizan,vertebraker,fakir,fred,vital,illarionDate: Dec  3 13:47It has been brought to my attention that i am being accused of tarnishingTyr's name so he would not be able to wiz on nirvana. Well to set the recordstraight i categorically deny any smear campaign about you and am notthe evil fuck you have made me out to be in order to keep you from wizzing.What i have done however is the following.1) Told senior wizzes that you have an elysium wiz char (entropy). This is  something you told me yourself, remember- and as pretty much everyone on   here in the wiz ranks knows, elysium is not exactly a friendly   mud to this place. There is standing documentation and rule policty   about people who choose to keep active wizzes on both muds. At least on   Nirvana, you really should not be maintaining an active wiz char on   elysium. 2) That being said, i did make fun of the sample code you sent me once in   mail. Look, i'm freely admitting that. You sent me something that   has lots of ANSI graphics but no real substance whatsoever in terms of   an innovative monster that utilizes logical structures and algorithms   to do something interesting. Cases in point, would be Boltar's reproducing   squirrels, or that shithot monster in Forbin's realm that mutates.So say what you will if you consider point number 2 to be characterassassination, but i categorically deny any of the things you have been tellingother players (me doing a mailin campaign to stop you from wizzing as oneexample) and the changing of your ranger color to 'whine'. Again, i denied thatand it is addressed in another mail that was sent to tyr and boltar.This is just for the record, for those of you who may be reading.I love taking the credit or blame for things i have done but want no partin anything that does not involve me.

Please get with me when you can.  Thank you. Jez **khrell**Subj: apoligiesCc: mizan,aingealDate: Dec 14 22:27  Well I can't or will not deny any involvement.  I haven't always had the best relations with Data.  At best we coudl have bene considered feuding, and at worst hateful foes.  There was a time when he made my life here a trial and a painful ordeal,  But I was told things would be handled and things did cool down.  Time passes he goes back to old habits, minor things that when separate looks extra innocent, but compounded they did add up.  Just the other day he was running about as one of his chars with a pet that was rather crude and insulting to one of my chars MUDwives.  (mortarion and feyth)  I was logged on as the character at the time and I may have taken it a bit to close to heart, but I don't like having friends attacked in such a manner, before I could act he had dismissed or had the pet killed so I had dismissed it.  I guess you can say I am not his biggest fan, and I was delighted to hear/see that he had been dewizzed.  Childish, yes.  But he was usually causing some sort of grief to someone here, so I sat back and let him stew in his own juices.  Aside from this thing I have been trying my best to stay out of trouble.  I do sincerely apoligise and will submit myself to any punishment you deem necessary.  If I am to be dewizzed for this then so be it.  I will not make false stories or try and skirt the issues.  I will face them head on and will take any punishments.  I'm not perfect, and I do get carried away easy with things as is quite apparent here, and in my less then spotless past on here.  Though if I am allowed to remain here as a wizard, I will allow myself to be observation of any, or what else is needed.  Once again I am sorry. **aingeal** Re:   apoligiesCc: khrell,mizan,aingealDate: Dec 17 17:49Sheesh, the stuff that goes on in my absence. I agree with Boltar 100% (as if he needs any agreement from me - but I felt the need to put my two cents in).  Snoop logs are for wizard eyes only absent extraordinary circumstances that require disclosure (Boltar mentioned this in his first email about this).  Each time things like this are misused, they become less effective as a tool for the purpose for which they were created (i.e. making sure that everyone is following the rules and that people are not harassing each other). I feel really bad that life has kept me so busy over the past few weeks that I  haven't been able to log in here and deal with any of this (Boltar shouldn't have to deal with this kind of stuff), but I never dreamed that a wiz would disclose a log like this.  Unbelievable.  I am very disappointed.  Aingeal f **stardream**Subj: mud issuesCc: (To: aingeal) boltar,mizan,khrellDate: Dec 18 00:45I placed a letter in my open directory, under /open/stardrea/mudissues.txt I wrote it in hopes that it could help the current situation that is happening now on the mud, involving wizard issues as well as the loss of players I'm not sure if its anything you haven't heard, but I felt it needed to be said I hope you all will understand that I'm not saying any of this out of disrespect and you'll try to take my comments into consideration thanks, SD **mizan** Re:   mud issuesCc: (To: stardream) aingeal,stardream,boltar,khrell,mizanDate: Dec 18 16:56I just want to make clear that i am taking the constructive criticism from Stardream to heart. However i would like to point out a few things... First off is that so long as my snoop objects were autoloading, i was snooping myself. I figured it was the least i could do to add a check and balance to the system. Eating my own dogfood, so to speak.  Secondly, that the sheer majority of cheating that has been observed is of a small group of repeat offenders. I think it is very rare indeed when a newbie/stranger comes on here and performs deliberate cheating.  That having been said, i shut down all snooping. I'm not even going to log people like worm (entreri@elysium) because quite frankly, he has nothing interesting to say/threaten about here anyhow.  Also i realize that for the greater good of the mud things need to change, but this whole issue about privacy being sacred is just in my opinion overblown. We would be fooling ourselves if we wanted to spread the message that this place is a safe, viable chat alternative. Raw telnet packets going over the air unencrypted- it would simply be irresponsible of us to promote that as a safe system to communicate with others. Now i realize that most IM protocols are also wide open. But i also realize that trying to spread a message to players that this is a safe place where wizzes will not just randomly snoop people for their amusement- I am totally in agreement with that part. 100 percent. So long as we are aware of the differences in these two issues i think things will be okay. Well, that's all i have to say for now, and that managing some of the perceptions to players (while i may not agree with the basis of many of them) is important, and i'm willing to adapt along.  Thanks for your time, -miz **fakir**Subj: dazed/wormCc: **Date: Dec 20 22:40I have spoken to worm.

When in fact, he did nothing and kept trying to pry information from other wizards to make his player characters better.  Then he even had the balls to use his wiz char to get his player chars into other guilds [i.e. asking Sahara to bite him into vampires as Dakeyras, when Sahara wasn't even a wiz.  Sahara actually complained about being bothered].  In short, this guy is nothing less than a completely arrogant tool who will serve nothing except to step on toes and generally piss people off.  And let's not forget he had a year to code his area and failed to make any substantive progress.

Younwun is not my char he is my cousins char who was spending the night over my house i let him play after i got done with tony since i did everything i could do for the night. They are saying i gave younwun alot of eq but the funny thing is i didnt even have anything to give him just like a few days ago because i just got mine back i had a amulet of lightning ,golden earring,and sparkling diamond ring with atlest around 40k coins at the time, mind you this is all i had. I started killing with tony had to borrow stuff out the tug list  weapons and i baught crystal ball of intelect since i needed some strap weps. just today i go everything back. Everythig i did myself took ele test 2 times all the exp i made on the board  shows i was killing alot to get things back. Now as far as younwun (my cuzin) i log out as tony he ask to get on i said yes u can b4 i went to bed i told him dont take bag with maalox and leaves  cuz they are tonys and i was using them and u and i could get in trouble i watched him majority the night cuz i tries to help him out since he still has alot to learn. didnt see nothing he did wrong. The eq he has now he been had for months and its funny how if he had that eq for months exception of arabian swords and blade of fallen. How come something just pops up now? Tony couldnt have gave him nothing because tony was release no to long ago. With a little bit of stuff he had so i couldnt help him if i tried.  They just come out of no where khrell saying i was swapping eq which i wasnt. I understand i have a bad past but really it just doesnt add up . i dont even get proof i just get jailed  and X says hes jailed dont talk to me its over all that blah blah. please mail me back on the subject.

If, for example, you first line is written thus...'The red piggy is stuck in the fence and it's ass is smiling at you!' I would expect to see a discription for the nouns piggy, fence, and ass.

For example, can I add more to a room after it has already been put into the game?  I have a fairly interesting and complex idea for a quest type thing to add to the area I'm working on right now (mine, not redoing Bagera's), but I don't have it all figured out yet, nor am I 100% certain that the way I plan to code it will work.  I have most of the rest of the files ready to upload (now that I have an FTP program that works and internet at home *WooHoo*), then I'll just need to run a test char through stuff.  Is it  possible to get another wizard to run their test char through my area to check and see if stuff is too weird, difficult, etc.?  We all know that I've never been the biggest one for actually playing the game so I don't think I'm the best judge.  Anyway, I think those are my questions for the moment.

There is a log.   **vertebraker**Subj: find_living()Date: Aug 31 01:02find_living() has been failing a lot off and on, especially when we're hitting our peak times .. has to do with "too long execution" errors with too many living things on the game. Any suggestions how to handle this at a lib level? Noticed it with Pav's guild this time cause he was doing  find_living("dragon name")  and so i changed  that to a variable stored in the gob for easy reference  These kinds of fixes are easy, but i've noticed other things that call find_living() like "stat" choking occasionally.  My guess is that it has something to do with the 24 hour boot cycle, but I'd rather implement something that cleans mobs out more often, or increases "clean" times or something. **vertebraker**Subj: monster guildCc: vertebrakerDate: Aug 31 07:32I temporarily deactivated Mizan's monster guild until he comes back as it's been a source of many mud errors and also I believe it to be behind the find_living() errors as those little mobs are teleporting into dozens of areas and loading files and starting stuff where players haven't even been.  **forbin**Subj: A guild question.Cc: vertebraker,forbinDate: Aug 31 17:46Due to Vertebraker's constant prodding, I am attempting to code an actual legal version of Mythos' old dark mage guild.  I would like to set it up so that they do not have sps at all, and all of their abilities instead require their sacrifice points.  I was told to run this by you to get your opinion on the matter.  Thanks in advance for any response.  If you have any indepth questions about it, feel free to ask me.  Forbin **jara**Subj: web site updateDate: Sep  2 15:37If you can add a link for the knights guild, I'd appreciate it. I just finished making a rough (but working) copy and it's online.  http://www.geocities.com/knightstemplarofnirvana/  Thanks :) **vertebraker**Subj: tallosCc: vital,forbin,zeus,fakirDate: Sep  3 23:20I demoted Tallos back down to a player for continuing to break wiz_rules such as accepting the choices of the administration, being combative with us as seniors and higher level wizards when he was told to stop. He has been a wiz for over 2 years now and has contributed absolutely nothing .. and should have been dewizzed with the others last year except I gave him a reprieve, which he has taken advantage of. He has continued to talk shit about other wizards on his wizard char and as his player chars and we have all had enough. I receive constant complaints about him every day and today he took to insulting Khrell on public channels and title setting.. this is not acceptable wizard behavior as we all know, he has had 2 years to make his decision on whether to be a wizard or not so now I have been forced to make it for him. **tallos**Subj: wizDate: Sep  3 23:33Boltar I've always supported this mud. And I think that being dewized for the actions of my players, which are not against any rules, is kinda wrong. I would like to continue to be a wizard, I've coded and area, its been submitted for approval, I'm not sitting on my hands hear, No one will talk to me about it. Please someone talk to me? I've always supported this mud. Please don't allowed this to continue. I'm asking you please to help me. **tallos**Subj: replyDate: Sep  4 01:03I don't use my other characters to bad mouth anyone.. and this is not the case. I was punished for simply wishing to know more about a situation. and my wizard character was punished for it. I don't understand why this is happening. There was no discussion and I'm nothing but supportive of this mud. I always have been. **tallos**Subj: actionsDate: Sep  4 15:57Hey I admit I called a another wizard a jackass, I don't think thats a reason to dewiz someone, and as a 2nd, who for the actions of a 2nd? Isn't that against multi? I mean, I didn't go out of my way to harass anyone? I didn't even start anything. Why should my wizard be punished for the actions of my player? The actions that are well within the game rules, and his character to do? I don't violate multi? Why should a senior wizard be able to punish me for the actions of someone who 'technically' is not that character? I just would like a ruling on this. Please.... **vertebraker**Subj: wormCc: fakirDate: Sep  4 21:15worm says he will do his time in peace and is sorry for blowing up. **"
