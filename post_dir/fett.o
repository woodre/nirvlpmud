messages "illarion** Re:   Guild Rank 10 in the Bards.Date: Jun 23 11:41Go ahead and submit an emote through the column in the guild hall.  I'll look at it, and if it's appropriate, spelled correctly, etc, I'll approve it, and if not, I'll send you feedback on it. **fett**Subj: Emote and MonitorCc: (To: illarion) fettDate: Jun 23 12:29Hey, I submitted my emote.  I like it not sure It was done exactly right but I guess your a better judge of that.  Also I see that we can have Distort, Regeneration, Battlesong on our monitor, can we also have digestion there too?  Thanks for your time.   Fett...(Party on!) **illarion**Subj: bard emoteDate: Jun 24 04:30You have the right idea, but it needs a lot of work. 1) For a promotion emote, you need to fill all the messages. 2) All three messages for the room emote are identical.  That defeats the whole purpose.  They need to fit the person who is seeing them. Looking at the current emotes and having someone use them on you and on someone else should show you what they should look like.  For example, in message 3, only YOU see that emote.  Therefore, instead of your name, you should see the word you.  Look through the help file to find out how to put that word in.  Put some more work into it and mail me again.  Once you get it close enough, I'll fix it for you, if you promise to make more once you make grank 10 - this isn't just a promotion task, it's something rank 10s can do any time but never have. **illarion** Re:   SocialDate: Jun 25 03:06It's looking better, but you still need all seven message types for a promotion emotion. In addition, the user emote still looks exactly like the room emote, which defeats the purpose of having seperate user and room emotes. For example, the first line should look like this when executed: You take a really close look at Illarion's gear. **"
