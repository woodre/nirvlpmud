I received a reply from Severance who basically said that's not how it is written in the help files, but he seemed to somewhat agree to it (please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not trying to put words in peoples mouths).  I haven't heard from anyone else.  I think it's an interesting topic.  Should someone who joined the guild THAT day create a vote to remove the entire guild ladder?  I see that as being extremely disrespectful.  They don't even know the guild yet, and they're already trying to usurp the ladder.  Also, I was very clear that I made that law effective immediately, but that we would collectively discuss the matter together, so that we could maybe come to a more sensible solution...one that we all agreed on.  I don't think what you posted was very smart Recca.  I think it was pretty rude.  I wasn't trying to be a dick.  I wasn't trying to be a dictator.  I was very open to discussing this issue with all of you and I made that very clear.  -Symb **symbio**Subj: dataDate: Aug 23 21:41unarmed 6(5) 7(4) 7(12) 6(5) 9(8)   35 rds, 34 hp nunchaku 7(7) 10(26) 8(17) 6(25) 12(9) 43 rds, 84 hp ninja_to 7(29) 5(10) 9(20) 7(11) 5(16) 33 rds, 86 hps tonfa 6(4) 8(22), 7(0), 4(23), 6(0) 31 rds, 49 hps naginata 6(12), 5(20), 8(11), 7(20), 7(8) 33 rds, 71 hps **jinichi**Subj: dishonorCc: deathseekerDate: Sep  1 22:10i was in guild hall deathseeker was raiding it to get to me i was lagging hardcore i quit out/dced and gmud crashed at the same time on me i loged back in and what should have been a dishonor! symbio said no he wont dishonor me for the reason i was laging really really bad...... however being the rule says no quiting out in a pk fight i broke the rule and feel i should be dishonored even if it was beyond my control!

I realize why you were irritated about players abusing the powers. Just merely saying lets call this thing off. No need for this to go further to the point of attacking pets of people who have not said boo to you in regards to anything just because you cant get to someone else's I realize you are going to laugh this off but it was worth a shot anyways.   Thank you, Mosh **"
