The returns flatten out right \nat the same max point so it should be not an issue there. \nNot sure if I am gonna be able to look at the other ones \nbut if I can I will try and get one done tonight. \nBy the way I did not do any spam on the extra specials \nso that still needs to be done. \n \nBob. \n\n**\nsami\n**\nSubj: Teleport spells\n\nCc: shinshi\nDate: Oct 27 16:13\n\nSome teleport spells like Mages tlp and elementalists teleport spell, does not seem to check for a no-teleport and can work inside of NO TP rooms. thanks \n\n**\nxerxes\n**\nSubj: item reward pt two\n\nDate: Jan 18 16:42\n\nForgot to give you the path \n/players/data/closed/defibrillator.c \n\n**\ntimespliter\n**\nSubj: pet bugged out\n\nDate: Mar  5 00:17\n\nhey a wocket pet bugged out at green, kept respawning at 3/10 wouldnt die, i noted the log. /players/sami/misc/petlog.txt thanks \n\n**\ntimespliter\n**\nSubj: new Mage idea\n\nDate: Mar  5 00:30\n\nthink it would be possible to have some kinda converter for more spell chances>? like for example, 4mill exp=chance of up to 5 spell chances, some thing like that? just a idea, throwing it out there, would love to be able to try some new mage spells. \n\n**\ndata\n**\nSubj: security\n\nDate: Mar 13 11:16\n\nJust logged onto here and got some bad file name errors and make_path absolute called. I got this after typing my name. Upon login it looks as if somehow my pfile was corrupted as my inventory was restored to whats on live...before all it had was a clan object due to trying to quit out one time and it didnt go thru the whole process. \n \nNext is I tested a couple ls directories, first I tried /players....and I ended up getting a shit ton of bad file name, make path absolute called before it listed all the wizard folders. \n \nLast ls I tried was to ls /players/zeus...got just ONE set of make path absolute called, bad file name...but whatever rump did works on keeping me from seeing whats in the directory \n\n**\n"
