We are re-aligning the wizard hierarchy and pushing through some progressive changes. You are all welcome to join us. If you are interested in working on Nirvana 5, please notify me at your leisure. **jamila**Subj: wowDate: Oct 23 23:38You came back and I missed you... trying to remember who my main char was when i bugged you all the time...

Anyways as players gain a level they gain perhaps 5 attrib points to distribute as they wish, perhaps a random stat will raise automatically each level.  Max for each stat will be 30, to conform with current standards; each race however, will have different maxes for each stat, with 30 being the ceiling.  Stats will be more in control of a char's power than level, but they gain stats through levels and xlevels.  Currently I don't have anything planned for gaining stats in any way other than level, although that may change.  strength:     damage bonuses in combat, carry capacity dexterity:    chance to hit in combat, dodge, parry, skills etc constitution: hp, hpr (regen rate), endurance points, epr willpower:    innate resistances, willpower type checks, has an effect on ep mental:       sp/spr, int/wis checks  racial, static stats: they either don't change, or aren't controlled by char: luck:      they can 'roll' this stat at char generation charisma:  also roll this at char generation, within limits set by race size:      this will go up as they level, until they reach their max size            also a rolled stat  Specifics:  HP: 10* con + 2*level + 2*xlevel      7  con at level 1  means 72  max hp - higher than now     30 con at level 19 means 338 max hp - about equivalent to now  SP: 10* men + 3*level + 3*xlevel      7  men at level 1  = 73      30 men at level 19 = 357   EP: 7*con + 3*wil + 2*level + 2*xlevel  HPR: racial modifier + con hp regen per minute, max of 60 SPR: racial modifier + men sp regen per minute EPR: racial modifier + 2/3 con + 1/3 wil  current stat checks will be routed to the most appropriate stat  Implementation: these won't go fully into the game for general players until this stuff has been thoroughly tested and races, gear changes, skills are ready to go in as well, but they will be the first in for testing. **vertebraker**Subj: yoCc: (To: earwax) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: May  8 21:52i'm moving and i'm turning in my cable modem tomorrow. so, i'll be back sometime in the next couple weeks. i'm going to be working on the rewards stuff offline.  tom **earwax**Subj: gordieDate: May 11 04:34if you made ANY changes to him you need to have logged them it seems to me that his regen got jacked through the roof, let me know what the deal is **earwax**Subj: gordieDate: May 11 04:50was he changed, and if so, why wasn't it logged and run through the approval process.

It can actually kill players that are low on hps, even if they are non-pk.  To have this happen at the green is rather unresonable and is highly abusable.  Forbs **forbin**Subj: Serious Bug.  IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NECCESSARY!Cc: (To: vertebraker) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: May 20 13:47I'm at a lost for how/why - but this is an issue that calls for IMMEDIATE solutions.  Apparently there is a coin glitch that occurs when players idle out while sitting in a room (hotel room that I know of).  When the player returns, they have what I'd call an assload of coins:  Achilles had almost 1.5 million after returning today.   Forbs **earwax**Subj: Double xp dayCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Jun  2 02:56I've been getting bugged about this from, it seems, damn near every player that logs on, lately.  Anyone have any problems with me  running one next Thursday?  -ew **earwax**Subj: object trackingCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Jul  4 04:21Object tracking has been added to the lib code...see /obj/objtracker.c This code is inherited by the various weapon/armor/treasure/bag/etc objects and tracks instances where multiple characters from the same ip end up with the same item.  The instances will be logged to /log/OBJECT_VIOLATIONS Take those entries with a grain of salt, it's very easy to eventually end up (within a reboot) with gear from an alt char, at times, but this is a tool for tracking repeat violations and extreme ones. It replaces mizan's object tracking, which was extremely resource- heavy, and very limited, through no fault of his, merely the lack of opportunity to implement it on the lib-level.  -Earwax **vertebraker**Subj: i'm back,Cc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Jul  6 08:21i'm back, thanks.  tom **earwax**Subj: violations log for gear passingCc: (To: stardream) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Jul 11 00:32/log/OBJECT_VIOLATIONS - they are now part of the lib and will trigger  for ALL characters passing gear to chars from their own ip - also  note that they receive a message upon receipt of gear from another char, something to the effect of 'Logging gear passing between chars' This is intended to eliminate this type of action as much as possible, and make it so they can't say 'i didn't know' ... if there are patterns emerging, well, hey, it's not like they didn't know.  Please check this log - mail me or edit /log/OBJECT_VIOLATIONS at the entry in order to indicate that entries have been acted upon,  -ew **earwax**Subj: wlog changeCc: (To: vertebraker) vertebraker,fred,illarion,earwax,francesco,forbin,fakir,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Jul 20 15:10wlog has been changed to now add all entries to /log/WR/WORK_REPORT as well as individual wizard work reps, typing 'wlog' without an arg  will show both your own log and the central log.

If you wish to know what I am talking about, read some of the mails he has sent me.  Personally, I like the mud the way it is. I don't want to change it. I have no intention of dancing to some tune Earwax feels like playing on his flute. I do not, nor never have abused wizard powers. I occasionally snoop a player, but never when two players are in a room or chatting. And, I usually (almost always) tell a player if and when I am snooping them and also when I turn snoop off.  Its absurd that Earwax even brings that into a conversation about being a wizard.   Personally Boltar, I am sick and tired of his heavy handed way of dealing with things...and it's my opinion you are going to have a dead mud very soon because of it.  I will not tolerate someone who threatens, cajoles, and is otherwise a dick.   It is true I do not contribute to the mud much, other than the areas I did code and are in play.  However, I have never seen my contribution here to be one of code.  Wizards come and go...power hungry, unstable wizards have come and gone.  In almost every case where there has been an abuse of power, or a lack of good judgement, I have had a hand in resolving that issue...in some way or another.  And, I might add, you have usually backed me up in most of the disputes I have had some involvement in.  I don't really care what Earwax does. I do not have the juice, nor the time, nor really the interest anymore to try and corral his over-bloated ego...I suspect that issue, if its dealt with, will have to rest with you. apply sphere to being a wizard here...I've had a good run. I have enjoyed the game, and enjoyed for the most part the people I have met here.  If the current gestapo Earwax does indeed have his way and dewizes me, so be it.  Even though he feels otherwise, I still think I contribute something to the game...but as always, I will leave that up to you to decide. I am way too old and way to long in the tooth here to care much what some bully wizard dictates to me as being 'his way or the highway'.  Do you really want someone like this in charge of things to the point you give him THAT much authority?  Vert NEVER had an ego like Earwax. He NEVER abused any wizard power. He never, once he became a wizard, cheated the game. I cannot say the same for Earwax.  There is a WORLD of difference between Vertebraker and Earwax as far as Admin goes.  Personally, if Earwax is in charge, I don't want to be a wizard here. * **fakir**Subj: dewizzingCc: (To: earwax) boltar,vertebraker,fred,illarion,francesco,forbin,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Oct  7 19:33You do what you wish...or rather...whatever B lets you get away with.  Personally, I'd bump you back to a level more fitting of your mental capacity and temperament, but unfortunately, we don't have wizards in the negative level category.  If you continue to travel the path you are currently walking, you will have a very dead mud.  I can almost guarantee it.  Further, I don't give a SHIT what you think, want, or do.  I lost all respect for you as a wizard when I caught you cheating with triggers.  You should have been de-wizzed then, and you should not be a wizard in charge of diddly shit now.  You have neither the skill nor ability to manage people...your ego is far to large a barrier for you to even see over, let alone allow you to manage others in a civil and appropriate manner.  Someday, when you grow up, and really learn what real life is all about, you will look back on this letter and chuckle.  I will no doubt be long gone by then, however.  Have a good life, and good luck riding herd over the bunch of twelve year old players your going to foster here...its right up your alley. f **earwax** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) boltar,vertebraker,fred,illarion,francesco,forbin,pavlik,jenny,stardreamDate: Oct  8 06:24Let's see.  Whatever I'm allowed to get away with.  Personally I'd rather not make decisions, I'd rather just code, that's what I'm good at and what I enjoy.  Babysitting a bunch of grown adults does nothing but irritate me and make me less productive.  I like to figure out  problems and code solutions to them.  This is my enjoyment, and it's the surrogate challenge for me, since the game is simply too easy as a player.  Now, the shit with the triggers, you yourself said and know that it wasn't like it was beneficial to me.  I was dealing with  exhaustion pure and simple.  But that's beside the point, I did what I did, but it still pales in comparison to your own abuses.  I made a mistake, you made repeated mistakes, and more than that, you haven't done anything positive for the game in years, and you have worked hard to be negative.  You bitch, but offer no solutions nor put forth any work.  The work I've done in one single object alone is more than your sum total of code in this game, ever, not to mention the simple fact that it's years beyond your comprehension or POTENTIAL level of  improvement.    If we want to get into specifics, I've done my best, other wizards have as well, to get you involved with improvements in the game.  Instead,  you're content with a slow death over the years, a slow reduction in playerbase each year, until this mud dies, whereas I'm doing everything I can to get as much influence from players and wizards to come up with solutions.  Not only that but I'm putting out thousands of lines of code, working with every wizard I can to teach them and tutor them, improve their skills, and encourage them, whereas you're most happy when you can sit on star and just talk shit about people as a playerchar.  I'm responding here, in this way, because you forced this.  The bottom line is that you spend your time on as a wizard griping and using the snoop command.  I spend mine coding and teaching others and encouraging others and administrating.  This is not even an implication, it's  simple fact.  The logs, the inherits and bug logs and everything else and every wizard on here, pretty much, speak for this, without me having to, yet you want to have a pissing contest.  How about this, put up, shut up, and have a positive impact other than resting on a single, minor area, you did however many years ago, with no positive impact since, instead of trying to put down my efforts.  Ego?  You're real funny, since you aren't even a competant builder, talking about someone that is a highly competant coder, that is doing their best to incorporate the ideas of everyone playing and coding for the game, especially where you just gripe and offer no solutions or work.  When you actually make a contribution open your mouth.  But that isn't going to happen, so just shut the fuck up.  -Earwax/David Halek **boltar** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) earwax,francesco,pavlik,stardream,jenny,pain,zeus,wocket,feldegast,vital,jaraxle,eurale,khrell,pestilence,puppy,star,wren,angel,martha,gemini,jamila,catt,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,aquila,kain,lacar,brittany,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,airwoman,catacomb,veehsan,haji,hair,skie,chip,sampson,vertebraker,xDate: Oct  8 21:41  How do we lose players/wizards?   1) personality conflicts, gossip, social bullshit.  2) bored because of a lack of new challenges.   That's it in a nutshell. I take responsibility for not being socially  good enough myself to keep a peace and get people to work good enough  together. but the fact remains that unless we complete some serious  rennovations the mud will just slide into obscurity.   Since there is no one else to do it. All conflicts between wizards  will be resolved by me. Odds are everyone involved will hate my solutions so I advise living and let live as much as possible and don't do things that you know are going to result in conflict or displine or even questionable if you're seen/caught doing them.   I need productive people right now, not squabbles. Everyone needs to add something positive. I can't have people that just exist to cause conflict because they find it entertaining to do so. I don't need people getting pissed off at every little thing. What the mud needs, what I need for the mud are productive people.  It's that simple. And before there is any more squabbling, ask yourself where you(individuals) are on that, and that is the squabbling going to  lead to anything positive or just piss people off so we get even more  short handed?   I'll leave it at that.   -Bp  **chip**Subj: IMPORTANT REQUEST!Cc: (To: vertebraker) x,fred,earwax,khrell,sami,wipeout,subotai,jenny,jareel,jaraxle,jara,fakir,mosobp,mizan,sparrow,star,sparkle,jamila,kasia,demonic,springdawn,cooper,sundin,worm,katya,bella,viper,feldegast,snow,symbio,whitehawk,lostsoul,artos,achilles,doodle,recca,deacon,dustyrose,rek,vahiti,griswold,hugh,oghma,tristian,francesco,eurale,breeti,coglin,brittany,armblessed,third,armadillo,zeus,wtknight,cobain,haze,pavlik,mythos,arrina,llew,hawkeye,airwoman,trixDate: Jan 30 01:09We are trying to liven Nirvana back up, please at least consider making a return!
