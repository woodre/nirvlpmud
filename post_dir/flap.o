Think about if such happened to your son, and someone were to say that to you...you can try and put up that hard "I don't care" front all you like, but as soon as that thought enters your mind again when it's brought up so coldly, it would be hurtful all over again. It totally blew my mind that even you could have said that man, I know you can be a dick, as can I or quite a few others around here, but that just went so far beyond it is ridiculous... and it was very obvious Sticks was more upset than he was letting you know, simply from the comment on star he made "I could wish the same on your kid, but I wouldn't wish that on anyone". and he was very right heh. anyway I'm not quite as pissed now, but i still haven't nearly the respect for you that I did.i'll bs with ya and shit but as far as being buddy-buddy like before, i dunno if i see that happening for a while at least. pz. **flap** Re:   hehCc: (To: sephiroth) flapDate: Sep  7 16:25the fact that i am a dad, and if anything happened to my kids, i would be hurt if anyone i personally knew said something like that to me, but i have been around this mud long enough to know...if someone says something about my family, my mother, my father or whatnot..i just blow it off to mudding junk..people here dont know me or my family, they have no idea what i am like in real life or anything about me really that i dont let them know, i dont come here looking for support from pple when i am having a hard time in life, i just come to vent and blow off steam..but as i said, its your choice how you take shit..is cool either way you wanna handle it, i was mudding before you came here, and i will probably still be stopping by here after your long gone. **sephiroth** Re:   hehDate: Sep  9 11:06well i understand that, all of it, completely. but unlike others, I've gotten at least a small feel for what you're like in rl, because when i had that issue a few weeks back, and we sat and bs'ed about it, it showed the fact you aren't such a prick in rl, at all. but for me, I've had almost nothing but backstabbers for rl friends, and have been forced to cut SO many ppl from my life, this is about the only place I really CAN go to find my couple supportive friends. So maybe it makes me pathetic or less of a real person, but it's the fact of the matter. And as for taking things personally, you know better than me taking things too much to heart, but at the same time I do get really fired up over anything involving children, especially any kind of a tragedy, but it's all in the past now, least in my opinion. oh yeah and as far as you stopping by here long after i'm gone....best of luck on that venture, I'm a permanent fixture here. prolly moreso than most anyone else around. anyway, i've got shit to do. pz **flap**Subj: soul gem ideaCc: (To: fred) flapDate: Mar 14 20:54I got a soul gem tonight and noticed the help file said it wasnt finished I got a soul gem tonight and noticed the help file said it wasnt finished I think a good idea would be to make it make the absorb corpse command more powerful. you absorb souls and if you ahve that gem socketed you get more bonus..something like that. or if you have the gem socketed you get wc bonus, and heal bonus or wc, ac and heal or something like that i will let you decide how powerful but they seem like they could go together nicely.   just my .02 worth.
