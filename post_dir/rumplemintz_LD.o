I had one person \ntell me that it makes them not want to play the game anymore because \nthey're just getting ass raped by the guards. \n \nI wasn't sure if it was brought to your attention (I'm sure it was) so I \nthought I'd just let you know what was going on. \n \n(X) Shinshi (X) \n\n**\nillarion\n**\nSubj: shards\n\nDate: Jan 28 21:25\n\nEven though balowski doesn't have a castle, the shards rely on code from \nhis dirs So maybe restore that one? \n\n**\nkyrian\n**\nSubj: password recovery\n\nDate: Jan 29 21:54\n\ni have forgoten my password for my alt kirk i havnt used him sense 2008 and \nfrom my hint i cant think of it lol can u please reset it please ty \n\n**\nkyrian\n**\nSubj: name of the alt i think i forgot to tell u\n\nDate: Jan 30 00:33\n\nkirk is the name of the alt i forgot if i told u \n\n**\nsymbio\n**\nSubj: Town Guards & Criminal Flag\n\nDate: Jan 30 19:14\n\nHey I was playing as Lebronjames earlier and the town guards attacked me after Chett and I sparred.  I ran through the village and by the time I got to chamber of realms I went from full hp to 46 hp. \n \nI just thought I'd let ya know that my criminal flag was tripped by sparring.  And I'm mailing you as Symbio because the town guards are fuckin' beast and they probably would have killed Lebronjames. \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: Channels\n\nCc: (To: illarion) rumplemintz\nDate: Feb  1 13:08\n\nHey Illarion, \nRump and I are working on creating a channel daemon. \nThe only thing we have left is getting the feelings in \n/bin/soul to work. I am looking at the code in std.c and \nam not understanding exactly how this works. Can you shed \nsome light on this? \ncall_other(\"/bin/soul/_\"+feeling, \"broadcast_feeling\", channel, targ) \n \nThe command in /bin/soul calls do_cmd, but I don't see how \nthe \"broadcast\" function is passed as an argument. \n \nAny thoughts? \nThanks, \n--Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: channel & walking dead\n\nDate: Feb  2 14:48\n\nHey Rump, \nI want to open Walking Dead this week since the show is back \non starting this weekend. I have fixed the callout issue and various \nbugs found during a few beta tests. The only thing I need you to re- \ncheck is I added some heals to some of the mobs in the town. Heals \nare in the /heals/mons directory, and the mobs are mons/guard, anthony, \nand oakley. I removed some of the gear from the guards. The others were \nno were near max coins so I didn't remove gear from them. Not having \ngreat coins was one of the biggest bitches I got from the beta. \nLet me know what you think. \n \nI made a lot of progress on the channel daemon. Illarion helped me \nfigure out how things were working, and I have the daemon now using \ncode in the daemon to handle the feelings. I'm not 100% done but I'd \nsay 75% of the way there. Some code will need to stay in std.c but I  \nthink we'll be able to remove most of it. \n \nThanks, -- Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: cd /players/dragnar/WalkingDead/\n\nDate: Feb  5 02:15\n\nHey, please read /players/dragnar/WalkingDead/heals/mons/INFO.txt \nand let me know what you think. I believe it is closer to what you \nwere looking for. \nI believe Jenny's area is way out of whack after talking to you \nthe other day. Those painkillers are valued way too low. \n \nIllarion daemonized the std.c object. I am not sure we even need to \nmess with the channel daemon now? If we leave \"broadcast\" the way it \nwas it will call the function in std.c which now uses a daemon. \n \nLet me know what you think. I won't be on much this week because \nI am working with a consultant during the day. \nThanks \n--Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: plasma\n\nDate: Feb 10 20:10\n\nThe slot machine in the casino was from plasma directory.

Is there any \nway you could put the phoenix file into my directory or his /COPIES \ndirectory? Unless you wanna just gimme access to read /players/guilds =P \nI'd be ok with that too ;) \n \nThanks! \n(X) Shinshi (X) \n\n**\nillarion\n**\nSubj: /players/guilds\n\nCc: fred\nDate: Feb 16 13:55\n\nI've updated player.c to consult /players/guilds/access.c when \ndoing valid_read and valid_write on /players/guilds \n \nIt seems to be working correctly, but if it breaks, you can \nrevert to /obj/player.c.ill.20140216 \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: Channels\n\nDate: Feb 21 15:38\n\nI am pretty close. I updated /players/guilds/dopplegangers slightly \nand everything is looking pretty good. Test it out and let me \nknow what you find. \n \n--Gnar \n\n**\nboltar\n**\nSubj: simul\n\nCc: mizan\nDate: Mar 27 11:19\n\n \nmud was broken this morning.  \nIn the process of trying to fix i I lost your backup simul_efun.c.check_file.  \n \nSo what I did is put the check_file simul efun inherit back in. commented out a file_size inherit. and put the check_file.c file back in place. Now the mud isup.  \n \nI asked mizan to restore the lost file.  \n \n \n\n**\nkai\n**\nSubj: issues\n\nDate: Apr  1 09:13\n\nthought we could see in the dark before we could now we cant? \n\n**\ntristian\n**\nSubj: Levels\n\nCc: (To: fred) rumplemintz,tristian\nDate: Apr 11 15:38\n\nHey.  I am trying to be diplomatic, but I curious if i could get my levels \nback so I can peek at other people's code again.  I learn alot more that \nway, and Dragnar has been helpful providing examples, but I dont want to \nkeep bothering him. I currently have about 40 rooms coded in \n/players/tristian/realms/supermax/rooms and I plan on finishing the area \noff with 2 more cell block wings, a  center section and the last leg of the \nprison which will be deathrow.  it will be a high level area similar to \nwings in Jennys with unique mobs. and it would go alot faster if i could \nlook at code to try to figure out the some of the things i am doing. all in \nall between supermax and death row i am figuring 70+ rooms, 2 dozen mobs, \nmaybe more and unique items and such. I am back, at least for the \nforeseeable future, Dragnar got me bitten with the bug to actually learn \ncode.  :) thanks, John...*Tristian* \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: Dopps\n\nDate: Apr 15 10:46\n\nHey, \nHey, \nKai killed Harry using horde spell and it bugged out: \nBad argument 1 to call_other() \nCurrent object was players/guilds/dopplegangers/power/06_horde, line 161 \n\"spells6\" in \"players/guilds/dopplegangers/guildob.c\" (\"players/guilds/dopplegangers/guildob#1215\") line 374 \n\"main\" in \"players/guilds/dopplegangers/power/06_horde.c\" (\"players/guilds/dopplegangers/power/06_horde\") line 36 \nBad argument 1 to call_other() \nCurrent object was players/guilds/dopplegangers/power/06_horde, line 79 \n\"spells6\" in \"players/guilds/dopplegangers/guildob.c\" (\"players/guilds/dopplegangers/guildob#1215\") line 374 \n\"main\" in \"players/guilds/dopplegangers/power/06_horde.c\" (\"players/guilds/dopplegangers/power/06_horde\") line 36 \n\n**\nshinshi\n**\nSubj: Necros\n\nDate: Apr 21 21:15\n\nMind if I take them over and \"update\" them a little bit?

It would connect but then \nit wouldn't give you a login. I had to kill the \nparse command on the linux box, then the restart \nscript restarted it and everything seems to be OK. \nJust an FYI. Lots of gremlins lately. \n--Gnar \n\n**\nboltar\n**\n Re:   nirvanamud.com\nDate: Jun  2 22:54\n\n \n not sure how to react... I have no issue with you running something on  \nyour own, and thanks for the invite there. but this moving the mud and  \ndomain name is kind of well disturbing...  I don't know how I should \nparse that...  \n \n \njust kinda hit from the side here...  \n \nis there something wrong with keeping the mud here?  \n \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: dropbox\n\nDate: Jun  3 19:06\n\nAre you using dropbox on the server? I thought you said you \ncouldn't get it to work. I noticed it is using 20% of \nthe memory on the box, so maybe you should kill it if \nyou don't need it. \nThanks \n--Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\n Re:   dropbox\nDate: Jun  6 14:08\n\nroot@loafy:/home/petebre/mymud/lp312/mudlib# ps -ef | grep dropbox \nwoodrya  14686     1  0 Jan23 ?        01:54:01 /home/woodrya/.dropbox-dist/dropbox \n \n \nPID is 14686 \n\n**\nstephens\n**\nSubj: Barbarians faction level 11\n\nDate: Jun 10 20:02\n\nHi Rump \nI wanted to let you know that no commands for level 11 \nin the barbarians faction work.   \n \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: calculate_worth\n\nCc: fred\nDate: Jun 24 15:46\n\nWhen you use add_spell to a mob, it doesn't add to the exp value. \nThe calculate worth is only looking at the old spell_dam \ntype of spells. \n \nIs this intended functionality? Or did this just missed along the way? \n \nI personally think mobs like Angel's that don't do much spell damage \nshould be worth quite a bit less than things like the lingering spirit \nthat does a ton of spell damage. \n \nLet me know if you have any thoughts on this. I'd like to fix \nit but I wanted to get input first. \n--Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: add_spell #2\n\nDate: Jun 25 13:13\n\nIgnore my rant. I had 2 wizards tell me add_spell doesn't add \nto the xp value. Of course when I tested it myself it does... \n--Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: LD\n\nDate: Jul 25 15:51\n\nJust wanted to give you an update since I will be out of town. \nI fixed the disconnect issue. I had to add /obj/player to the \nvalid_exec function.   \n \nInt still seems to be 32bit. The exlv_guild was throwing errors \n, it seems if you max an int value it throws in error on LD. \nI thought we were going to have 64bit ints? Is that something \nwe can change? \n \ncp is still not working, I asked Mokri to look at it, feel \nfree to crack the whip. I promoted pestilence and have him \nand shinshi doing the add_verb and add_xverb updates (there \nare a ton of them in the /player dirs).  \n \nI had to update exlv_guild. The m_values simlu_efun on LP is \nsorted, the efun on LD is not. It causes the exlv_guild \nto do all sorts of crazy things like give players millions \nof exp when they died. That is fixed now. \nOk thats it, see you next week when I get back. \n--Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: 1 more thing\n\nDate: Jul 25 15:53\n\nI hacked together a crontab job to startup LD now that we \nhave the shutdown working. It is ugly but it works until \nyou can do something better with daemontools. \n--Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: map_array\n\nCc: (To: mokri) rumplemintz\nDate: Aug  6 17:35\n\n/players/vertebraker/closed/shardak/cmds/help.c uses map_array \nwhich looks like a valid efun. It fails in LD, do either of \nyou know if there is an efun for this in LD? \n--Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: LD cp\n\nCc: (To: mokri) rumplemintz\nDate: Aug  8 00:09\n\nI looked at /bin/wiz/_cp.c tonight for a bit. I made \na little progress. For some reason the efun uses \n/etc/filer which was not loading. I have that fixed \nbut now the valid_write is failing. \n \ncp works if you cp to the /open directory, otherwise \nthe valid_write fails.  \n--Gnar \n \nPS I had to comment out a part of /etc/filer that \nwas referring to check_previous_privilege, I was \ngetting an undefined function and I couldn't find \nit. \n\n**\nrumplemintz\n**\n Re:   LD cp\nCc: (To: dragnar) mokri,rumplemintz\nDate: Aug  8 12:40\n\nYou can remove references to /etc/filer - I haven't got it working \nlike I want anyway. \n \nLooks like we need to fix valid_write - which is what I thought anyway. \n\n**\nrumplemintz\n**\n Re:   map_array\nCc: (To: dragnar) mokri,rumplemintz\nDate: Aug  8 12:40\n\nmap_array was obsoleted by map() \n \nIf you're passing an array to map_array, then you can just use the same \nsyntax with map \n \nI'll upload a doc into /doc/efun/map \n\n**\nillarion\n**\nSubj: weapon.c\n\nCc: (To: dragnar) fred,rumplemintz\nDate: Aug 11 19:19\n\nI made some changes to drop() and stopwield() in weapon.c to try \nto make things easier on wizards wanting to offwield without \nweapon shadows. \n \nIf they break things, there's a backup copy of weapon.c before I \ndoctored it you can retore in /obj \n \nIll \n\n**\nwicket\n**\nSubj: help guilds\n\nDate: Jan  2 10:37\n\ncan u please add my guild elementalists to the help guilds file.... \ni would appreciate it \nthank you \nWicket \n\n**\nx\n**\nSubj: /obj/door.h\n\nDate: Feb  3 02:30\n\n/obj/door.h - \n \nThis door object is not spawning inside Padrone's castle for the quest. \n \nOr at least, not consistently... Can you check into this?   \n \n ~padrone/walker/upper_hall.c \n\n**\nvertebraker\n**\nSubj: hey dood\n\nDate: Feb  8 03:59\n\n Hey dood, I am back but not really ready to start coding.  I am playing a \nfair amount and trying to get a feel of the gameplay again. \n \nI no longer know the edit password for /obj/ /closed/, etc., but do not \nneed to know it at the moment regardless.   \n \nCan you do me a favor though and relocate my .o file from /post_dir and \nmove it to my ~/closed/notes/ directory ?  I want my mailbox to start \nfresh, but I always enjoy reading through all the travails of years ago \nwhen I am bored. Lol. \n \nIf you don't mind, just move it to \n/players/vertebraker/closed/notes/mailbox.2015 \n \nThanks :-) \n \n-Tom \n\n**\nvertebraker\n**\n Re:   mail file\nDate: Feb  9 22:55\n\nThank you! \n \nI know just how it goes...  \n \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: write_file\n\nDate: Feb 27 15:05\n\nHey Rump, \nDuring guild testing we have noticed that write_file is \nfailing for players. Any write_file used to write log files \netc. are failing with Bad file name.  Testing is going pretty well, \nif you want to look at results look at /players/sami/misc/ldguildtest.txt \nThanks, \n--Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: restore_object\n\nDate: Mar  3 13:30\n\nI put the sefun back for restore_object. On the new driver, if there \nare no variables in the object that calls the restore_object, it just \nreturns 1, no reason to do the restore right? As soon as I added a \nvariable to shinshi's spell that would get set from the restore_object \nit started to work. \nJust something to keep in mind... \n--Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: valid_read\n\nDate: Mar 10 00:29\n\nOK, so I identified the issue but I'm not sure how to \nhandle it. In master.c the valid_read function is passed \nan object caller. The first thing that happens is a check \nis done to see if caller is master.c, if so it returns 1. \nThe issue is caller is always (almost always?) master.c. \nI added code to write to a log file when the caller is master.c \nand it seemed to always write to it. \nCheck /log/valid_read_gnar. I created an object to do a get_dir \ncall (/players/dragnar/test/test). I also did an ls command which \nalso does get_dir. In both cases caller = this_object(). I printed \nout the caller_stack in the log. \n \nLet me know what you think. \n--Gnar \n\n**\ndragnar\n**\nSubj: Bad file name\n\nDate: Mar 11 17:11\n\nsave_me in player.c checks to see if player level > EXPLORE || \nfile_size(\"/players/\"+name+\".o\") > 0, if so it does the save_object \nthere was well. \n \nThe file_size call is making a call to make_path_absolute \nbut because the file doesn't exist you get the Bad file name message. \n--John \n\n**\n"
