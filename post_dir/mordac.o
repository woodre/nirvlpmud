messages "star**Subj: HuhDate: Aug  7 04:56I saw this thing on TV just now about the Chincoteague ponies..  I always did wanna go there.  Then it occurred to me to have a look at something else.  It's 350 miles from here to Chincoteague directly. Stopping at HdG in the middle only adds 27 miles..  And the trip from here to there directly doesn't look fun as far as going near to DC and all that.  Going through HdG would avoid that.  Of course the kids had asked for a simple camping trip for our next vacation. Disney wore them out..  So next summer we had no grand plans..   Might run through the summer after, but of course I'd have the kids.  I suppose if I had a reason to do it I might take my own vacation again sometime.  I used to take a week off on my own, without the kids.  Usually I went to Florida, or my ex-bf came here.  Didn't do it this last spring cos I had no reason to..  shrug.  Maybe I'll have a reason to wanna go someplace on my own again sometime.  We'll see..  *8)  Kat (AKA Star) **"
