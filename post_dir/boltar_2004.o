I even got wizards slapping me for no good damn reason.Vertebraker, Fred, Bardox, Cons, Darkfyre, Sharpe, Notta, Hottentot, Darknesss, Willow, Hoyle, Gogeta, and Rothgar are all slapping me (Major Spam) And Vertebraker just won't stop.

They still should have to live under the "rules"I am sorry that I had to come to you for this but if I couldn't talk to wizard that was on then I was going to mail you.Vertebraker tells you: you whinerVertebraker slaps you from afar.THEY ARE ALL SLAPPING ME FOR NO FUCKING REASON.Vertebraker tells you: you forgot the smiley:)Vertebraker tells you: and I didn't slap after I typed that:)Vertebraker tells you: i slapped before ya damn fool:)I think your wizards are very rude and they need to be taught a lesson.

I have a small problem with my character.  Yesterday Iwas on and I decided to leave the fallen.  I died, dropped from 14 to 13 and my mag andste dropped to 1 and int to 19.  After praying, I spend a vast amount of my xp bringing my magand ste back up.  When I logged back in today, I was to my surprise a part of the fallen again.It would be nice to be able to not be a part of the fallen as I had intended without havingto die in the process.   Matrix**smack**Subj: Character hackDate: Sep 26 20:25Boltar, I mailed you the other day about getting hacked.

In my opinion it isthrowing off balance within the game.  Eurale coded thoughand I really don't want to get into a pissing contest withabout whether it should be changed or not.  Basically it'sa portable heal that doesn't actually heal.  It lowers yoursoak and stuff toxes.  Breakdown on it is cost is 1400 coins,5 uses per tablet, each use lowers soak -7 and stuff -7, fora total detox of -35 soak -35 stuff on each tablet. So now players can use regular heals instead of say highdens or getting some of the non-tox heals that are out there. So in essence you never have to worry about toxing on a mob.Once a player hits say 40% toxed they can take down an entiremaalox and be at almost 0's again.  So I'll leave it that as just voicing my opinion. I just thought that it shouldhave some form of drawback or be removed.  Thanks.Fred.**fred**Subj: maalox (part 2)Date: Oct  2 17:18I forgot if you wanted to look at the codeit's /players/eurale/VAMPIRES/OBJ/maalox.cFred**mizan**Subj: akjdbiuvadfCc: mizanDate: Oct  2 21:55I'll be emailing you a screen cap shortly...What's a good address to send it to?(tij@beanos.com).**pharcyde**Subj: MizanCc: vertebrakerDate: Oct  2 22:02Mizan is continually harassing me, even after I changed my OTHERcharacter's pretitle accordingly...then jailed him after holding himin one room, then I log another character and jsut go about my wayother than to let him know i stopped and he jailed him as wellthen this character said absolutely nothign to him of any kind and he'scontinually harassing me dragging me out of post while i'm trying to send mail.finally left me alone long enuf for that thoughI feell this harassment is uncalled for and I request somethingbe done about it. it's an abuse of poweralso I have avari as my main witness as to the ahrassmentThank you much,Pharcyde, a 9-year player of your wonderful MUD**mizan**Subj: PharcydeCc: mizanDate: Oct  2 22:03I hate to drag you into this, but this is the log of what happenedwith Pharcyde/Juggalo/Akjdbiuvadf/players/mizan/logs/pharcyde.txtHe basically logged in with the Akjdbiuvadf name, and set an offensivetitle.

Well finally I was lagging, I went west, Mizan summoned me to Moe and then started talking to me about the bug. I had NO idea that this was a bug. I just decided to attack him after my friend told me what to do and then Humble and Mizan started saying that I was a liar and such. And then Mizan imprisoned me. My friend said that since it was a first offense then I should be left off with a warning but Mizan imprisoned Zeek instead and took all of his stuff. Then I logged on this name and asked him when Zeek would be out of prison and all he said was: Its not in my hands anymore. My friend said that if you heard of this then Mizan would loose his wizarding powers. I am sorry that I had to write to you because of this, but this is rediculous. I didn't know it was a bug.

The creature Moe located in: /players/gowron/room/moesstill has some kind of error that kicks in with its heartbeat.The players can then pound the hell out of it once the heartbeatis lost and get a relatively easy kill out of it. Apparently themob is worth a good amount of reward.In either case, Humble tipped me off that someone was abusing thebug. I got to see it firsthand, and questioned the person abusing it(Zeek). I imprisoned Zeek (but otherwise didn't harm his character)because he lied to me about not having exploited this bug before.It's your call, i have no objections freeing Zeek in a bit becausehe had the pants scared off him after i figured out what his secondswere, what his favorite weapons, and attack monsters were, etc.There were no traces in the /debug.log so i have no idea what causedthe monster to lose its heartbeat. I have not made any changes tothe monster's environment, so the problem is still in effect.Thanks,-m**treebeard**Subj: Hoth MonsterCc: (To: eurale) boltarDate: Oct 12 20:51Dear Eurale  I was playing the other day, and I had my wolf, my kid, and youkeep demon with me.

I don't care how the EQ gets from onepoint to the other. Arguing the technicalities of it is futile.Specifically, the item in question was a copy of Gordie Howe's hockeystick.You are repeatedly giving me crap about this issue. I chose to simplysteal the stick from your inventory instead of imprisoning you.I see that the subtle message was not one that you received.Let's put it this way.

This is just a heads up. I imprisoned pan and uriel tonight becausethey appeared to have been one person playing two characters. I have a longscreen cap but without seeing the timing between the two character's commandsequences it kind of doesn't do the full justice of it.Oh well. To make a long story short here is the chain of events.I login. Puppy suspects that Uriel and Pan might be the same person becauseof the slow command cycles, and IP address.We realize that this is the IP that Kezef and Whitewolf (their primaries)login from.I ghetto-snoop them and watch their commands for a while. Fairly slow wordsper minute, and lots of random little mistakes that match the confusion ofone person playing two chars. This happened for perhaps 10-15 minutes.I goto them, and just sit in the room watching. I start talking with bothof them at once and explain i am not convinced they are two people. Words perminute are still very slow and broken.I tell them i don't buy the act and imprison both characters (uriel, pan).Kezef (uriel) logs back in and starts to complain. Still fairly low words perminute, and Whitewolf (pan) doesn't login until i wonder why only one personis there.Words per minute go through the roof. At this point it looks clear that thereare two people logged in.After seeing for some time that there is definitely two people on at once, itell them both that i am going to release both characters in the AM (28 oct).I tried telling them that having no less than 15 chars and partying themtogether is not a great way to get on the good side of wizards who 'p h'.If you have any suggestions on dealing with this or what the new policies areplease let me know. Luckily nothing got out of hand, there was no violencefrom either side other than me imprisoning their chars.Yes, it is possible that they were multitasking, i.e. watching TV while playingand goofing around. But to not take it seriously when a wizard arrives and anotheris asking them what is going on, that's just reckless. A little background story- Kezef and Whitewolf share the same place.Some of the other chars that originate as theirs:roc, softwind, mordrin, uriel, maxy, halo, ironman, creep, minsc, angle,pan, skittles, whitewolf, kezef, fawn.Thanks for reading.**billy**Subj: HackedDate: Oct 30 13:06I've been hacked by either Crip (His other alts are: Yoshimitsu, Blade, and Shadowstar) or Gogeta (His other alts are: Krillgeta, Fury, Glaxgor, and his sister Cleipa.)Tristian told me that the hacking problems should go to you.

But on talking to a bunch of mudders on a diffrent mud I found that there is many who have tried this mud and did not like it.which brings me to my idea the main complaint was simple they logged on and felt lost the open ended theme of the mud turns alot off becouse they just dont know what "type" of mud it is. I thought about it and realize if it wasnt for a RL firend of mine I wouldnt of given this mud a chance either. SO heres is my idea..make a theme for the mud I know the fun is the openess of it but the theme can be simple such as the main village being a plane that opens up to other planes/dimensions. you can have new log in room or redo the church that explains that. Maybea brief history two mighty mages  dukining it out or scientific experment went bad what ever. Anyway I think that alot of new mudders would stay and  find out what a great place this  can be. So thats my idea its rough but hopefuly it can be used . weather or not you want to use it please send me a mail or tell letting me know you got it I wont peseter over it but it be nice to know it was at least read.Blaze@@@**matrix**Subj: Toque, Resetting the passwordDate: Dec  8 17:32Hi, just wanting to resurrect one of my old chars, Toque.However, I can't for the life of me rememberwhat his password is.

Get this... by wizzing,and then running a fork bomb process. I shit you not. Sure, i got thisinfo from Zidane but i seem to have the luck of catching Zidane when heis coherent and quite pleasant to talk to. Moadeep plans on enlisting thehelp of the MD kids to get him to wiz one of his chars. However its alreadyfalling apart at the seams. The line where ZIDANE (of all people) says"Sorry to say but he IS, kinda a .... well... Loser" had me literallyrolling and giggling like a chubby Malaysian schoolgirl. Er. Sorry.Just in case anyone misses on what a fork bomb is, it is a fairly elevatedpriv level attack that exhausts the resources of a server. It works like a bunny population explosion. Its also logistically hard, like saying:'well, i am going join the Secret Service and then fill the White House with popcorn to piss off da prez'. I would prefer that none of you reveal that zidane was the one to filledme in on this info. Relevant log files are /players/mizan/logs/snoop/clair,followed by ./alecI have a raw screen cap but boy, is it longish. It's a good read though,and i would prefer to mail it than leave it sitting in /open in thisparticular case.I haven't dont anything else in this case, just keeping my eyes peeled.Pain did catch initially the hint that something bad was going to happenand this seems to be it.

Well guesswhat? It has no bearing on the game. That's right, none. That is happeningoutside of the mud. She could be sending pics of herself having sex with aherd of elephants just to get doolotz pissed, but again, that has zeropractical involvement with us. She could be tattooed and swasticas andenjoying herself at a Japanese Bukkake cumfest, and i wouldn't really givea damn. Why? Cos it's happening OFF the mud and there is nothing that isee from her behavior on the mud that warrants her getting banned.You on the other hand, Doolotz:1) Harrassing Wendy's chars2) Lying to my face repeatedly about stopping your behavior.3) Breaking Pain's agreement to not create new characters to login.4) Enlisting others to your cause of attacking this mud with a fork() attack.End of story.Doolotz, you are a waste of flesh. I had tried to remove all stimuli thatcaused problems. I got Crip to stop messing with you. I managed to curb Dataand other wizzes that strongly dislike you. I avoided contact with you fora period, and what happens? You make up new problems, which were previouslynon-existent. That is why i have given up hope on you. YOU ARE A CRYBABY.Your life is horribly misprioritized. You're homeless, jobless, and all you'reconcerned about is mudding. How about an income? It's holiday season, peoplewill hire just about any able bodied person to do some work. And FYI Denny'shires illegal fucking aliens to do the dishes, what do they care about a drugtest for?If you fail to see and understand this logical conclusion, well...i'm sad for you.

Now, Jaraxle has coded the same thing. Soon, we will have a rash of portable detox substances on the mud. NONE of these are good for the game...no matter how much we make them cost. It makes the hardest mobs killable with normal heals by a solo player. I think we should make a policy and ban portable detox. There are places players can go to use (in place) injected detox. This means they must leave a battle to do it and there-by risk losing the kill.

If theydon't have it done, or haven't contributed significantly insome way, we go ahead and knock them back down to player.When they are ready to be a serious wizard they can try again.This rule does not apply to anyone above L21 or people likeMizan [who obviously would be above this rule] and Quicksilver[who helped re-code Shadows years back with Pathfinder and thusI think has earned his wizardship].  It has more to do with NEWwizards if anyone.The quest system is shot and just a small hoop to jump thru now-I think we are suffering simply by allowing too many schlubs in.Anyway, at least consider it.tom/Verte**vertebraker**Subj: noteDate: May 13 05:43sending ya a note about where i am in the classic guilds project:I wrote up a core object/system in /obj/guilds/.  Have to clean itup a bit yet but it's working well.  Automates saves/loads/guild logging,channels, amongst other things.So I have the basic piece.Along the road I've been trying to recruit a few wizards to work onthe guilds that will be revived.Undead is still #1 priority.But for the other slots [if we do 'em]-Alchemists [Scathe/Earwax]-Monks      [Quicksilver]and I got Fakir and Jareel to say they'd assist in at other guildsat my discretion.Scathe obviously had some ish's in the past, but outside of beinga gossipmonger, he doesn't reveal player info or tell wizardly things,and heck: he was in the original Alchs.  Now, of course we don'thave Sweetness' code... but we have the working idea of the abils.Alchs obviously aren't the _top_ priority tho ...  We also have someof Sado's working ideas and the code that he adapted from Sweetness's.Earwax is good to go on coding if he can maintain his focus.I do have some ishs about him giving players info/tips to play,which obviously is a no no.  But it hasn't yet reached any considerabledegree of problematics.Quicksilver of course is an old school player who I think is a perfectchoice to lead one of these old school guilds :)  And, he can code.Fakir and Jareel are good roleplayers and good at getting the players active.So, that's it for now.  Thought I'd let ya know I'm actually doing stuff					verte**vertebraker**Subj: referralDate: May 13 15:12Hey: Maybe we don't want to do this, but I thought of an idea. How about a referral program for new players? Ok; Basically works like this. Bob plays frequently.  Now Bob hears about the referral program.  So, he gets his RL friend Bill to start playing. When we ask a new question at login:   Who did you hear about Nirvana from? Bill types in 'Bob' Bill plays for some period of time... maybe, 10 days. So we award Bob as the "referrer" some unique item that he couldn't get elsewhere... OR some other prize.  Not sure what, but we can come up with that when we are actually ready to go on this.The caveats of this system that I can think of: -Bob IS Bill -Bill is someone ELSE's character...Ok: I think this would be taken care of if we instituted something similar to panop/authcheck.  Maybe something internal on the mud... or I could talk to Miz and see if he can do something with his SQL logs.. I know mythos has a tool that 'mines' the pfiles dirs and reports other chars via IP.. to a relative extent.  I could adapt this and make it work better..  And if we take a hardline stance that if this is abused, we do something extremely nasty to the offender.. like rm his characters.. then i doubt the vast majority of players will really try to buck the system.Besides, if it's an age requirement before they get awarded a prize, at least they're logging in ;)Well, what do you think?**vertebraker**Subj: VitalDate: May 16 14:52I'm mailing to ask/beg you to consider Vital as a fellow L1000in the Technical dept.  He's as good a coder as I am and hasbeen helpful in numerous mud/lib changes I've implemented overthe past couple years.I think he be perfect in a role like the one we hoped Balowski[...had Reflex been able to lure him back].  He's very experiencedin LPC as well as many other languages and is looked up to bymany of the younger wizards here.He's committed to improving Nirvana and making it a place thatcontinues to attract new players, appeal to the existing player-base and improving the overall efficiency. He's been specificallyoffered work with that other mud, but turned them down flat onthe principle of the thing, not to mention the desire to work"here".Right now I'm busy with the guilds project so that's distractingmost of my time.  There are plenty of things to still work on inthe lib and he's flush with ideas. If he doesn't know the answerhe's not afraid to do the research to learn it.And also he can be there to doublecheck my work to make surethe friggin' mud doesn't crash.  With Pain and Sandman scarcelyhere, he'll be a good check on whatever I do.. helping debugany mistakes I make and then I can do the same for him.Again, I stress a 'Technical' field only...Hey, it's only to lighten your headache:)Verte**vertebraker**Subj: bogDate: May 17 17:43I'm a bit confused on the wiztool policy here..I thought ppl could only have wiztools if theycoded them themselves or got L40.. cos mizanhands out snoopers.. i.e. /open/mizan/cheaposnoop.cfbogging why tristian needed a snoop device andshould have access to one:)**vertebraker**Subj: sweetmiseryDate: May 19 03:57Sweetmisery is interested in wizing/doing some sort ofcoding test to get there. She has no experience but isadept at writing descriptions and the like. I gave hersome links to run to in order to learn basics about LPCbefore she begins to code.Any way I can put her on your nirv box and have hertry some LPC stuffs to see if she can handle it andlikes it before she wants to devote time to learning it?**vertebraker**Subj: jamilaCc: vital,fakir,jaraxle,wocket,fredDate: May 21 23:27After careful thought I decided not to approve Jamilaafter all. There is nothing to say, except that Ido not have much respect for her as a human beingand thusly cannot support her wizardhood on Nirvana.I previously approved her, but went into her pfileand took it out.Doesn't mean she'll make a bad wizard, I'm justnot interested in promoting her growth here.**vital**Subj: workroom/toolCc: (To: gemini) vital,boltar,vertebraker,fred,wocket,jaraxle,beck,fakir,painDate: May 23 14:31I've editted your workroom. There were several problems withhow you set it up that violated the established policies forcoders on Nirvana. The original workroom was either directlyor indirectly aimed at extending your command set beyond thegroup of commands indicated for a level 21 coder.This is your warning. If you make any attempt to circumventthis by uploading other copies of workroom or transplantingthe code into a tool, you will be demoted.If there is no command to do what you want to do in wizhelpthen don't attempt to do that action. As you gain additionallevels you will be given more freedom to do other things.Thanks,Vital**gemini**Subj: okayCc: (To: vital) vital,boltar,vertebraker,fred,wocket,jaraxle,beck,fakir,painDate: May 23 17:23while i understand your judgement. I would have preferred it if you had just brought it to my attention and I could have made the changes myself to your liking.im in the process of removing what ever was in my working dir so you do not have to scan thru my files any more...i was also under the impression that boltar was allowing tools to be created is one made them. I asked this multiple times, and even told other arch's that my room had these functions. I find it ironic that that room has been exactlyhow it was when you edited it for the last 10 months... why all of a sudden it is pointed out and edited 10 months later I do not understand..**zidane**Subj: It won't allow meCc: (To: boltar) boltarDate: May 23 22:13I can't send the e-mail it keeps giving me this other e-mail it refuses the nirvana_lpmud@yahoo.com what to do am I?**vertebraker**Subj: envDate: May 24 02:41Earwax, Mizan, and Vital want a general purpose arrayin /obj/player.. something like set_env() { }query_env() { }that they can plug variables into. I was wonderingwhat you were thinking about this since obviouslythe size could get out of control if usage of itwasn't watched properly.**vertebraker**Subj: UsagiDate: May 24 04:23I rm'd Usagi's playerfile.. he's back and wantsto play for real. I don't think we ever hadproblems with him except when he spammed thecrap out of the mud for no reason.He's started out again all fresh.verte**vertebraker**Subj: xp ideaDate: May 24 04:58Hey,What do you think about this idea-  Players get a bonus for a monster that they haven'tkilled recently [xp-wise].  Let's say 10%.  If they killthat monster again not long afterwards, NO bonus.Now everytime afterwards that they kill that monsterwithin a short amt of time, they lose a percent.. saystart at -3%.. then go -6%..  -9%.. It would give a reward to those who kill in differentareas as well as encourage others to fight in newerareas.  But the xp drawback wouldn't be significantenough to stop ppl from fighting in their favoriteareas if they were willing to take the small % hit.**vertebraker**Subj: xp, cont.Date: May 24 05:22Ok, how about this for formulas:1st kill: +10% xp2nd kill: -15% xp3rd kill: -10% xp4th kill: -5% xp5th kill: No bonus/drawbackAfter that, a constant -5% xp.The point of the high xp cut after the first kill is topoint them towards fighting something else.  Then itbecomes more moderate.And bear in mind this xp is for each unique mob they fight..I figure I could have a call back from each mob to theirmaster object [the clone to the master] and tally theplayer's real_name in a mapping.  This would not saveover boots naturally.  So after boot the cycle startsall over.  Let me know what you think :)  I thinkthe idea is certainly solid, if not the formula, andwe could see what players think when we put it in.**usagi**Subj: DonationDate: May 24 07:47Hi,I was wondering if I could donate to the monthly costs of Nirvana via paypal?? Thanks**vertebraker** Re:   envDate: May 24 10:40nog.. they wanted them to save..that's why i initially said no and asked you.That stuff will get out of hand eventually.And anything that's really dire that needs to beadded you or I can add.**vital**Subj: development mudCc: vital,vertebrakerDate: May 25 17:07I managed to break player.c on the development Nirvana.I was dc'd during an update of player.c and couldn't getback in because I hadn't put the pieces back for fullfunctionality.The files that were altered are all backed up in the dir/obj/vital.bak/ to allow for easy reset of the mud.Already I have cleaned about 15k out of the player.c andmanaged to clean up a host of messy dependencies thatmade the player object take more memory that it neededto when it loaded.Sorry about the lockup.I should be able to have player.c down to about the sizeof Sears Tower by the weekend. From there I think we cantrim it down to about the size of the Empire State Bldg.in no time. Getting it to the size of a modest officecomplex will take just a bit longer. Who knows, by theend of the month, we may even have it looking like ElleMacPherson.Vital**"
