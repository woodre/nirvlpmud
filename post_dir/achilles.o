Once they're out of beta though, feel free to whack away at them :) There'll be a note posted at the green when such happens. Oh, and there's still a couple beta spots open if you're interested. i'd like to have you aboard. just need a character at least 19+8 that you don't mind losing their current guild status. thanks again. Chip **worm**Subj: NirvanaCc: (To: boltar) x,tristian,fred,mizan,star,shinshi,angel,khrell,artos,achillesDate: May  6 00:02 Now that we've started to reestablish a playerbase, I have a bit of input I think may help. I feel that rather than reopen old guilds, or open new guilds, that touching up current guilds, adding new things to them would catch the attention of ppl we already have back playing. It would be awesome to assign wizards to each guild, trying to update them in anyway we can. That would build intrest in playing/killing more.. at the  same time, ppl would be out leveling more, helping lower levels etc. Just bringing a fresh feel back to the game. Artos feels having a PK Tourny once in awhile would help. He pointed out attracting pkers, ppl who like to chat a lot over public channels would also help gain intrest for players in the game, attracting old/new players etc. Honestly, I think the MUD has already taken a breath of fresh air and is on a nice roll. I'm just hoping we can all pitch in, in any way we can to help it keep on rolling. So, even though i'm just a player, I figured i'd start pestering you guys with ideas.. some i'm sure you'll blow off, others I hope you'll consider. Although, once again, i'd like to point out one thing.. I know rules are in place and need to be followed, but I think warnings should be given. Like a strike 1,2,3 and you're jailed.. rather than just jailing and banning.  To tell you the truth, losing just one player could lead to possibly losing his friends. While we're trying to revive this place, I think every player counts. I know Bolts ends up at the end of all the drama, so I think the wizards should handle most things themselves, without jailing when possible. I'm just hoping we can find a way to keep it fun for everyone involved.  Anyway, thanks for your time.. if you've read this far. ;)  -me *8 oopsee **dragnar**Subj: WastelandsDate: Sep 23 14:46I saw that you asked what had been updated in the Wastelands... I updated the mobs so that they are current. For the smaller mobs like ninjas and the corpses in the graveyard, it basically means I updated their coins, and updates how strong their spell damage is.  For the bigger mobs, Master Ninja, Tyme, demon, ogre, and Shardik,  they were completely re-done. They range now from Level 25 - 30 with exp from 100k to 1.3 million.  Shardik and the demon are very difficult. Master Ninja has some surprises and my mage had a harder time than i expected with him.  Overall the mobs are now up to par with other current areas. --Gnar **merto**Subj: GATMCc: (To: recca) xiao,severance,hugh,achilles,symbio,kyllurDate: Apr  4 16:40I, Merto, have deposited 400,000 coins into the GATM, for the sole purpose of Sesshamoru to withdraw them to help him finnish guild enhancements and levels, as a gift. informing the members of rank. thanks. **sektor**Subj: gatmCc: (To: xiao) achillesDate: Nov  7 19:01deposited 409000 for my new recruit rikimaru **"
