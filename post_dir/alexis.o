It is in the bestinterest of our bloodlines to share our gift with you.If you are able to find other members of the Family who would also extend to you this invitation, then by all means avail your-self of that opportunity, but also know that your presence is nowactively sought by myself and others.Respectfully,HottentotThe Vampire Shining One**marius**Subj: Missing youDate: Aug 12 18:08My dearest, Know that in my heart a piece is missing.  I do so wishto look into your eyes once again and gaze upon the unblemished beauty of your soul.  I have this emptyspot inside of myself which only in speaking to you onceagain would be filled.  I have been away far too long from your loving embrace and would cherish any amount of time spent in your company.Your distraughtMarius**marius**Subj: Your smile, your sweetnessDate: Sep 18 17:15I realize this not will probably be a let down in that the subject was misleading.  I merely wanted to let you know how much I miss your smile and in truth the sweetness which surrounds you.  You are in my heart always and there are no doubts of that.  I have  been away forsome time now yet I remain to loyal to you and what you stand for.  I desperately hope to find the time again when I am holding you in my arms and able to forget the rest of the world when gazing into your eyes.The sparkle in your eyes and the warmth of your embrace are but a part of the whole in which my thoughts turn to you.  The soft Nightingale voicewhich eases my pain, the tender caress which makes feeling worth having.In short, you are missed, my dear and I hope to see you soon.quit**cartham**Subj: you knowCc: (To: feyth) alexisDate: Dec 24 10:44just sitting here missing you and setting up my world now. just curious, is there a certain faction that is better than another? **khrell**Subj: My lovely eyes.Cc: kwDate: Feb 12 16:02Ahh you do me proud my dear Eyes.  I suffered a horrible hacking attack on my 'net.  My WoW account and emails were hit and it took me a few days to get it all sorted out.  Suffice to say, my confidence is shaken and I am full of worry.  I hope You haven't been hit through gmail as the addressbook in my gmail may have been copied or such.  Keep those lovely eyes open and I am still around....  -Khrell, the Old One Dragon. **ancaladar** Re:   Your applicationDate: Mar 30 14:30I'm on and off throughout the day. i will be on most of tuesday and wednesday. usually im not on a lot until after 9 pm central time  let me know if u need anything else. ancaladar **"
