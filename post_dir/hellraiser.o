messages "journey**Subj: rangersDate: Jun  3 12:49FYI,Some people are gonna screw with you and tell you to quit guild and get down tolevel 10 for rangers.  DON'T!  There are no more spots left 1st of all, 2nd, theywon't let you in anyways cause of the was you player seperate.  Don't ask me why,but I was talkin to Rek today and he told me to let you know not do persue itbecause of those 2 things.  Rek isn't a bad guy if you get to know him.  He's kewlwith me and gives me heads up like that shit.  Don't say anything to anyone, justleave it be.  If you have any questions, I'm around here and there.  But for now,Rangers are a no go for just about everyone.  I tried to talk to Cooper about yougetting in and there is actually 1 spot left and it's spoken for already.  I hadno control over it cause it was a guild vote by high guild members.  So,Unfortunately, Rangers are a no go for you.  On the bright side tho, Shardak's arecommin back and are gonna be just as powerful if not more so, with the same xp costto advance.  Typical of the power ranges anyways.  So, if you still like pk, andlike to have the same killing force, talk to me about it and Im sure we can arrangesomething out.  I'll be a high guild member in that guild and I have a lot of pullwith the main guys that will run it. Let me know.  IT's actually a fun guild and itWILL help you learn this place fast.Talk to ya soon broJ**"
