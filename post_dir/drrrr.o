The returns flatten out right at the same max point so it should be not an issue there. Not sure if I am gonna be able to look at the other ones but if I can I will try and get one done tonight. By the way I did not do any spam on the extra specials so that still needs to be done.  Bob. **sami**Subj: Teleport spellsCc: shinshiDate: Oct 27 16:13Some teleport spells like Mages tlp and elementalists teleport spell, does not seem to check for a no-teleport and can work inside of NO TP rooms. thanks **xerxes**Subj: item reward pt twoDate: Jan 18 16:42Forgot to give you the path /players/data/closed/defibrillator.c **timespliter**Subj: new Mage ideaDate: Mar  5 00:30think it would be possible to have some kinda converter for more spell chances>? like for example, 4mill exp=chance of up to 5 spell chances, some thing like that? just a idea, throwing it out there, would love to be able to try some new mage spells. **charm**Subj: emailDate: Apr  7 10:45hi... only 3 of you have it....just mosobp, sami and now you... so please dont share it.. =) emmadavis1975@yahoo.com    - yes its not original...shows my age.....but thanks for noticing i wasnt around....=) *Charm* **recca**Subj: Guild Law (Pike)Cc: shinshi, sami, peanut, fred, severance, hughDate: Apr 28 03:49According to new CyberNinja Law, Pike needs to be removed as a CyberNinja Directive. It was deemed that as of the new law's posting (Sat Mar 28 16:23:38 2015): "Each ranked Cyberninja (those listed in the guild Ladder) must login at least once a month (a rolling 30 day period). Those who fail to do so will lose their position. A post on the guild boards can warrant an extended leave."  This would allow for absense until 4/27/15. As he has not logged in since then, he is valid for dismissal.  Thanks, - Recca, Directive of CyberNetica. **rumplemintz**Subj: LDDate: May  5 10:16I think I have this whole permissions thing figured out (not fixed!!)  With the stock 2.4.5 mudlib that comes with LDmud, everything works as planned.  I reverted some master/simul stuff back to that stock, and have narrowed the issue down to the resolv_path simul_efun.  That's where the path isn't getting calculated correctly, which adds the current path when it's not supposed to, adds a slash, etc....  We should just need to fix that simul_efun to work properly (or as expected) and our issues should go away.  **mosobp**Subj: ranger command centerCc: fredDate: May 27 21:20so there is a line in command center creating a bad callout when they type monitor to check on the solar collectors and such. I didnt have access to get very far into it, but told them i would pass the word along.   let me know if you have any questions  Jason G **mosobp** Re:   ranger command centerDate: May 29 18:06room is /players/guilds/Rangers/CommandCenter/CommandCenter.c command is "monitor" **"
