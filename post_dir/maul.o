This drug not only increasesthe combat effectiveness of his army but strengthens hiscontrol over his folowers.In game use this could be represented a few different waysA you could code 'Potions of Strength' a basic Return 5,every combat round for a minute 'Maul jabs a needle inhis arm and fights harder'  or have the bigenic cocktailincrease the strength and stamina for a short period oftime that increases over time(IE the higher the guildrankthe more addept you are at accepting the cocktail) You could do a combination of both also, both Ideas have a built in drawback of having to buy them each time theywear out, or at each loggin.-Level 1 of AoP, seems a little strong so far, I can killBroo (A level 17 Mob) efficiently, I have ac 15, Tridentof War.who2Rush may need to be downgraded or get better as you gain levels.-Peace brother**pestilence**Subj: rushDate: Dec 18 19:24rush can't do anymore damage than magic missile and it's stat basedso i don't think it's the rush that's doing itP**pestilence**Subj: ArmyCc: (To: talus) fzendatu,maul,sobear,gotenDate: Mar 17 21:54I have temporarily closed the army because of my inactivity.  Youcan choose to remain in the guild but will have very limited guild skills.I'm sorry for this inconvenience.  You can also choose to leave_guildyou will lose no xps or stats or lvls, however you won't get your guild xps restored.I have that information stored so when i reopen the testing if you wish to continue to test you will have your current status reinstated. Any questions or problemsfeel free to mail me.Pestilence**ever**Subj: heyCc: (To: legend) maulDate: Aug  4 02:23got you the mask  **fastkill**Subj: That partyDate: Feb 27 00:03Yo i cannot do that party tomorrow morning, will have to put a rain check on it till thursday morning, i got alot of shit to do early...wont be back till around 3 or so.  **dragnar**Subj: NYDate: Mar 13 17:01Where do you live in NY?! . * **"
