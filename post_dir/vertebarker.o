YOu don't leave it up in the air. I'm sick of your bullshit, the plain way I see it is I either remove you from influence or you talk to me and I don't.  This bullshit over a fucking fat mud bitch is some garbage.    I need you in full capacity, i need you to be at your best and I'm  quite frankly sick of dealing with you on downcycles with fat nasty mudchicks.  This is the end. You come back now, and be productive or you are gone period.  I can't keep doing the roller coaster, you make the decision. If I don't hear from you I will rm everything that has ever logged on from an IP you have, and will siteban all those.  I need you here, for my own sanity, but you playing this stupid  bullshit is counterproductive to me, so it ends now.  This is it, there's no tomorrow, it's all or nothing. -David **"
