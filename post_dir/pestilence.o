It's not something I was intending on doing, until I realized that Katya also had a copy of code that was doing this.  In the future please do not provide her with any code that can do this functionality. You're not in trouble here, and i'm not trying to force my hand on you- it's just that if someone else saw it (like Earwax) it would have been a problem. Deleting the files was a quick and dirty solution. I also deleted the 'idlers' functionality on her side as well.  Just use your judgement and don't put things back into your wiztool unless it's something that helps you code areas or is something harmless like a toy/emoter or similar. If you want a copy of the backup let me know. I apologize if this seems heavy handed but it really isn't my intent at all. It was a matter of seeing something potentially embarrassing and just stuffing it under the carpet, if you know what i mean.  -miz **dragnar**Subj: Guild cmdsDate: Jul 14 16:08OK, previous_object() simply returns the object that called the command. In most cases that will be the guild object. So if you wanted to call a function in the guild object you would do:  previous_object()->query_mon_color(); for example  If you want to tell the user a message, you would need previous_object but not quite the way you did it.  You would want it to be like:  tell_object( environment(previous_object()), "Your mark of the Dark Order darkens...\n");  If previous_object() returns the guild obj, then the environment of that obj is the player.  Hope that helps? --Gnar **illarion**Subj: offwieldDate: Aug  8 21:50/players/vertebraker/guilds/samurai/bin/_offwield.c  note that the guild object keeps track of the offwielded weapon, but you could simply loop all the player's weapons and check for one instead of keeping track of it in the guild object  if you want to add a guild damage bonus I recommend either using the weapon.c enchant code or else the more global RegisterWeaponBonus in living.c rather than using gen_wc_bonus or a shadow **fred**Subj: DODate: Sep 11 12:42Okay.  If you feel comfortable with where they are you can open them back up.  Thanks.   Fred **dragnar**Subj: cblastDate: Sep 23 20:41Approved. I had to add some code to do some checks, I found a bug which came from my meth (which I updated as well.) Approval added to wlog. --John **dragnar**Subj: Chrono BlastDate: Sep 25 14:50I found a bug with your new heal. If you tox out and try to drink it, it will make you more evil but not use the heal. I think the only way to fix it is to update /obj/generic_heal. I will keep you posted. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: cblastDate: Sep 25 20:53Fixed. Details in wlog. **fred** Re:   sp only healsDate: Oct 30 09:46Works for me.  Fred **boltar** Re:   daycareDate: Oct 31 10:14 There are 45 spaces still left in dc5.  looks like someone editing it recently. Maybe something was broke in the code.   **dragnar**Subj: LDCc: (To: shinshi) rumplemintz,fred,star,pestilenceDate: Feb 25 16:36We did a lot of testing on LD today. If you see things in the logs that look illegal, such as giving players coins etc. keep in mind the logs between LD/LP are shared. Check with me before you punish someone. Sami/Krillgeta/Yen and all of their alts are helping me test the guilds on LD. Thanks, -Gnar **charm**Subj: wishDate: May 29 19:15Wish I could of talked to you longer..
