There were several problems withhow you set it up that violated the established policies forcoders on Nirvana. The original workroom was either directlyor indirectly aimed at extending your command set beyond thegroup of commands indicated for a level 21 coder.This is your warning. If you make any attempt to circumventthis by uploading other copies of workroom or transplantingthe code into a tool, you will be demoted.If there is no command to do what you want to do in wizhelpthen don't attempt to do that action. As you gain additionallevels you will be given more freedom to do other things.Thanks,Vital**vertebraker**Subj: approvalDate: May 24 03:51welp, i went through your area [the rooms anyway]Check out /open/verte/gemini/verteReview.txtFix all that stuff and let me know.Then I'll double-check it, ... after rooms are done,I'll go through mobs and items.But right now you have at least 6 more rooms to add to hitthe bare minimum of 15-20 rooms to open a first area.So start yer brainstormin'!:)It's a very free associative, dreamlike area, and we don'thave a whole heck of a lot of those, so I am allowing itfor now despite it's whacko theme.  But because I amletting it basically run from Ali-G to the Muppets toTron, it needs to be fairly well done.  There is verylittle in the way of 'original code' and that bothers me.You may want to take a bit more time and make thingsmore interesting- adding real heals to the burger shopwould be a good start, something like that.**vertebraker**Subj: wizbookCc: vitalDate: May 25 09:23I fixed wizbook, it's in /obj/wizbook.c**vertebraker** Re:   ok u can tear it apartDate: Jun 14 20:18Ok, I have a few other things to do before I get to your areaapproval again tho.**vertebraker** Re:   help stuffDate: Jun 14 22:49quicksilver asked first :) sorry**francesco**Subj: kale'sDate: Jun 16 01:26yes, it happened with the cyberninja guild too,it is due to the way kale's are coded.it can be fixed easily, provided we can meet.fran**cearwyn**Subj: the shadowsCc: cearwynDate: Sep  3 21:05WAS wondering if you need anybeta testers if so could i get a spot?Sincerly yoursCearwyn**mizan**Subj: Fastkill (potentially good outcome though)Cc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,pain,aingeal,puppy,francesco,wren,fred,khrell,gemini,samiDate: Sep 17 17:50Before we begin this is not the usual crimescene blotter mudmail. It has apotentially positive note.I just spoke to Fastkill (Sami) and we've come to an agreement of sorts.He will:1) Use only ONE player character for this time forward.2) Try to keep a low profile from conflicts on channels and stuff.3) Immediately identify himself (hi, i am fastkill) if a wizard speaks to   him or is trying to figure out what is going on.In turn i will:1) Leave him alone. (basically this is me, following his rule #2)2) Be responsive to him if he has any questions or game issues3) Try to get other wizards to also follow his rule #2 as well.The contents of our conversation lives in /open/mizan/fastkill-meeting.txt.He wants to play by the rules, so i figured it would be best to give him a structured chance to do so. It has worked well in the past.

The problem with it is that the codes don't go through any kind of parser, and there's simply too much  legacy code to go through and correct.  I actually wrote the color parser on my other mud, it wasn't a trivial job, believe me.  The only real way to do it would be either on the driver level, or to code one and then change every single bit of color in the game over.  I'm not up for that, and I don't know if anyone else, but talk to the powers-that-be about it, who knows.  I could always port parts of it over, at least, and if someone were willing to start the other shit it might get interesting.

This time it was the same bug as Earwax had nailed him earlier exploiting.  The dervish can offwield (as you know) and it is offset by not being able to use a shield.  Yet he was wearing a full death set of armor (armor, gloves,  amulet, misc, helmet, boots, and shield) while wielding and offwielding two Iron Death Blades.  Since I'm not a PA and none were here or unidle, I issued him a warning.  But am also sending this report to you.  He is also a well established bug abuser and rule breaker.  Before the days  of the PAs Mizan and I had caught him any MANY times, just so you know. **vertebraker**Subj: khrellCc: (To: stardream) fred,gemini,marthaDate: Dec 12 14:36don't remove khrell's logs **vertebraker**Subj: vahitiCc: (To: stardream) gemini,martha,fredDate: Dec 12 16:11take no action against vahiti til i resolve it. **khrell**Subj: again VahitiCc: (To: stardream) vertebraker,earwax,francesco,stardream,martha,gemini,fredDate: Dec 12 22:50Apparently he decided to ignore TWO previous wizard warnings about the blatant abuse of a known bug involving offwield.  As not mor ethen two minutes ago I noticed he was yet AGAIN doing the exact same thing.  It is not like he has not been given fair warning.  It really bothers me that there are never any PAs around when he is doing this, and it is  not very fair to players who follow the rules and are not abusing any sort of bugs or exploits in code.  And since I am not a PA, I cannot do any sort of action against him as we were clearly told to let the PAs handle these sort of issues. **earwax**Subj: Armor shitCc: (To: zeus) wocket,feldegast,pain,jaraxle,eurale,beck,jenny,pestilence,puppy,wren,martha,gemini,angel,jamila,catt,star,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,mokri,sparrow,rumplemintz,aquila,lacar,quicksilver,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,catacomb,hair,veeshan,haywire,skie,sampson,y,chax,lisheDate: Mar 29 02:39I'd like you all to give me some feedback on this shit, just send me a reply to it....basically it involves a HUGE fundamental change to the mud, but one long overdue, i (and many players and wizzes) feel.  Basically, instead of all guilds, all players, using same gear  essentially, and everything being max ac, weight 1, with specials,  this will create a lot of diversity, especially considering that the guilds can be made to utilize the changes very easily.  The file to look at is /open/earwax/armor.txt  Just send a reply, not reply all, or post, I'll be sharing all feedback with the other admins and whatnot.  This is a major deal, so please send your feedback.  -earwax **earwax**Subj: ldmudCc: (To: forbin) francesco,fakir,pavlik,stardream,jenny,pain,zeus,wocket,feldegast,vital,jaraxle,eurale,khrell,pestilence,puppy,star,wren,angel,martha,gemini,jamila,catt,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,aquila,kain,lacar,brittany,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,airwoman,catacomb,veeshan,haji,hair,skie,chip,sampson,chax,y,atipode,lisheDate: Oct  6 07:22I need to see work on this project.

If you wish to know what I am talking about, read some of the mails he has sent me.  Personally, I like the mud the way it is. I don't want to change it. I have no intention of dancing to some tune Earwax feels like playing on his flute. I do not, nor never have abused wizard powers. I occasionally snoop a player, but never when two players are in a room or chatting. And, I usually (almost always) tell a player if and when I am snooping them and also when I turn snoop off.  Its absurd that Earwax even brings that into a conversation about being a wizard.   Personally Boltar, I am sick and tired of his heavy handed way of dealing with things...and it's my opinion you are going to have a dead mud very soon because of it.  I will not tolerate someone who threatens, cajoles, and is otherwise a dick.   It is true I do not contribute to the mud much, other than the areas I did code and are in play.  However, I have never seen my contribution here to be one of code.  Wizards come and go...power hungry, unstable wizards have come and gone.  In almost every case where there has been an abuse of power, or a lack of good judgement, I have had a hand in resolving that issue...in some way or another.  And, I might add, you have usually backed me up in most of the disputes I have had some involvement in.  I don't really care what Earwax does. I do not have the juice, nor the time, nor really the interest anymore to try and corral his over-bloated ego...I suspect that issue, if its dealt with, will have to rest with you. apply sphere to being a wizard here...I've had a good run. I have enjoyed the game, and enjoyed for the most part the people I have met here.  If the current gestapo Earwax does indeed have his way and dewizes me, so be it.  Even though he feels otherwise, I still think I contribute something to the game...but as always, I will leave that up to you to decide. I am way too old and way to long in the tooth here to care much what some bully wizard dictates to me as being 'his way or the highway'.  Do you really want someone like this in charge of things to the point you give him THAT much authority?  Vert NEVER had an ego like Earwax. He NEVER abused any wizard power. He never, once he became a wizard, cheated the game. I cannot say the same for Earwax.  There is a WORLD of difference between Vertebraker and Earwax as far as Admin goes.  Personally, if Earwax is in charge, I don't want to be a wizard here. * **chip** Re:   dewizzingCc: (To: fakir) zeotide,boltar,earwax,fred,vertebraker,x,pestilence,star,martha,jamila,khrell,francesco,stardream,illarion,pavlik,brittany,tristian,jareel,humble,mosobp,linus,puppy,eurale,jaraxle,feldegast,wocket,veeshan,data,katya,gemini,angel,zeus,painDate: Oct  8 04:07really? you don't snoop players chatting? then it's so funny how you knew the things my templar said to Earwax about a matter dealing with your templar who was on at the time, you drunk egotistical worthless fucking jackass.

I take responsibility for not being socially  good enough myself to keep a peace and get people to work good enough  together. but the fact remains that unless we complete some serious  rennovations the mud will just slide into obscurity.   Since there is no one else to do it. All conflicts between wizards  will be resolved by me. Odds are everyone involved will hate my solutions so I advise living and let live as much as possible and don't do things that you know are going to result in conflict or displine or even questionable if you're seen/caught doing them.   I need productive people right now, not squabbles. Everyone needs to add something positive. I can't have people that just exist to cause conflict because they find it entertaining to do so. I don't need people getting pissed off at every little thing. What the mud needs, what I need for the mud are productive people.  It's that simple. And before there is any more squabbling, ask yourself where you(individuals) are on that, and that is the squabbling going to  lead to anything positive or just piss people off so we get even more  short handed?   I'll leave it at that.   -Bp  **"
