I know this is a really random thing to ask you, however, it's popped up in my mind quite a bit. I was wondering if I had a chance at becoming a wizard, if I met the requirements to become a wizard. I know my past has been very... annoying. I wish I could go back and prevent myself from playing Nirvana until now since I'm much more mature than I was 6-7 years ago. I know that I've done some really bad things here and I really regret it. I know an apology doesn't fix anything however I thought I'd try ;)  So therefore, I was wondering if there was any possibility of me becoming a wizard. If there is a possibility, I look forward to becoming a part of the wizard community. If not, I'm very sorry for wasting your time with this mail.  Thanks/Sorry in advance, Mark (Billy/Viper/Maximus/etc.) **"
