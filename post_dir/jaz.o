I asked for aid killing a mob in pk area cause i was running low on heals.  I'm not a criminal unless he just made me one, and I'm lvl 10 while he's +lvl.  Yet he attacked me when I asked for help, almost killed me.  Isn't that attemtped murder?  Not a knight ally thing to do when someone asks for AID.See what you can do?~S**rage**Subj: wicketCc: (To: justin) jazDate: Jun 22 18:17Wicket      Crime: attempted murder   Pardon date: Fri Sep 24 02:01:13 2004->> Darc ( player 13 ) has entered the game.alliance-=[Alliance]=- Wicket enters the game.how's that possible? just out of curiousity?rage**beck**Subj: rDate: Apr 10 08:44Everything all set now? Beck **chip**Subj: Attn: Hdg muddersCc: (To: blizzard) chip,crip,ice,yoshimitsu,demonic,darkfyre,nytewhisp,damion,bardock,vahiti,lloyd,southstar,valerie,devi,virus,viper,fleshhunter,krillgeta,gogeta,shadowman,cloud,seifer,ritcher,justin,james,jaz,jackDate: Oct 20 17:21As you guys know, as this character or Sephiroth, I'm an HdG mudder as well, born and raised. My first area I'm going to make will be the town of Havre de Grace, including the heights, state park, schools (minus bakerfield), most of rt 40, the downtown area and the waterside. I'd like to get ideas and input from all of you who would be interested in bringing our beloved HdG onto Nirvana and make it the best area it can possibly be. I've got a majority of it mapped out on paper as a reference for directions and order of streets and businesses. But there's still alot to do as far as detail and setting it up to be coded. All ideas and suggestions will be taken into serious consideration, and many I'm pretty sure will get used. For all those who actively participate in this hometown pride even as I like to call it, I'll have a plaque or something of the sort set up in one of the main areas of it with the names listed of all those who help bring it together. I want it to be the best it can be, as I'm sure all of you do too. Mail me anything you think of, or email it to me at nyteshade187@hotmail.com / message it to me at http://www.myspace.com/lostminddeusesmuerte, or IM me at knockmyselfout82. And as I will be taking this project very seriously, only serious suggestions will be considered. Hope to hear things back from you guys (and girl lol). Best wishes. **chip** Re:   Good IdaCc: james,justinDate: Jan 17 15:03I've kinda put the whole thing on hold as i've no internet at home and can rarely, if ever, log on. i hope before long i can come back to the mud full time and put HdG together in full. i'm still making notes of all idea on the side though, as well as saving emails and mudmails of ideas from all us HdG raised mudders. good to hear back from you, W. hope to talk to ya soon Thanks, Chip **"
