Regardless of what you've done [or plan to do]we ask now that you create your first area in the nextthree (3) months. No exceptions. This is passed downfrom the highest levels in Nirvana's administration,which means that you will be dewized if you do notdo as we ask. With the recent flush of new wizards,it is imperative that we weed the real serious wizardsout from the pack. If you are already working on yourfirst area, then consider this a happy little note tocontinue your progress.Note: If you are dewized, you may of course requestwizardhood once again from any seniors. But know thatwe will remember your failure here.Sincerely, Vertebraker**pestilence**Subj: WizardshipCc: (To: data) sparkle,jaryn,novowels,syn,trent,dakeyras,plasma,wratchild,jack,boltarDate: Sep 17 20:04You have been either inactive and/or unproductive, as result of this youhave been Dewized.  Good news is that there is a way to have your wizshiprestored.  If you feel you can become a productive member of the wizard familyyou can mail me, and you'll be given 1 chance to prove you can be productive.You'll be given a 2 week probation period, where you'll be watched to see ifthere is any attempt to code and create.  This will be your only chance, soif you choose to come back don't mess it up.  And remember i'm not the cause of your dewizing, nor did i do the actuall act, I'm here to offer you a secondchance.  Thanx for taking time to read this.Pestilence**"
