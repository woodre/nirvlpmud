Typeof() I had forgotten totallyabout, and didn't think it'd work on mappings here anyways, so woohoo :)Earwax**vertebraker**Subj: fbombDate: May 25 15:58Hey, you're not *supposed* to logon a playercharacter at the same time as your wiz at L21.Anyway, just trying to treat everyone virtuallythe same.  Finish something so I can promote youferchrist! :)**vertebraker**Subj: wlogDate: Jul  3 02:11Hey dood..I'm working on adding test char support to wiz cmds, andin doing so I noticed you made the following change:Mar 18 23:37 Quicksilver -> +300000 xp to HakashuI realize this is Mosobp (a wiz) so I'm sure it's legitbut for standard's sake, we are logging everything we do,especially reimbursements/compensations and so forth,so in the future just type something like:'wlog Reimbursed Hakashu 300k xp#Some strange bug ate him.'or something of that ilk.syntax is 'wlog <action>#<reason>', or I expanded theformat so you can just type 'wlog <action>' as well.It writes to a personal log in /log/WR/ which we can useto verify changes you have made.But any kind of changes you make to players, such as compingeq/coins/xp .. or closing portions of code, desting objects,imprisoning peeps, etc, you don't have to let me know whatya did (i trust ya), just log it if ya would :)Thanks-tom/V**jezebel**Subj: Mmm :)Date: Oct 15 11:03Yer boo! didnt scur me :) And hey...I thank you for sharing an ip with me....and btw...yer all cuddly and loveable and stuff...*drool* I love you too!me ;)((**khrell**Subj: my apologyDate: Dec 17 23:53Ok first off I owe you an sincere apology.  I am sorry I was such a moron and spread a log of something I had no business reading, let alone  showing it to other wizards.  Also I am sorry you had to find out about this through a second hand source.  I hope you can accept my sincere apologies for this and for being tactless and spreading   it about as a one sided form of a exchange.  It was not my business and hope I can find some sort of forgiveness for not bringing this to your attention first, and only.  Khrell **vertebraker**Subj: heyDate: May 29 17:14Hey, you still around? Wanna talk to ya! What's your email?  tom/v **kudzu**Subj: help filesDate: Jun 20 18:22The help for the describe feature is confusing.  It doesn't point out that you need a tilde before every command and it tells you to type clear to clear, when that actually doesn't do anything!  This might just all be a problem with my MUD client though, if it works for everyone else. **earwax**Subj: Armor shitCc: (To: zeus) wocket,feldegast,pain,jaraxle,eurale,beck,jenny,pestilence,puppy,wren,martha,gemini,angel,jamila,catt,star,tristian,linus,mosobp,jara,humble,mokri,sparrow,rumplemintz,aquila,lacar,quicksilver,jareel,katya,data,catwoman,catacomb,hair,veeshan,haywire,skie,sampson,y,chax,lisheDate: Mar 29 02:39I'd like you all to give me some feedback on this shit, just send me a reply to it....basically it involves a HUGE fundamental change to the mud, but one long overdue, i (and many players and wizzes) feel.  Basically, instead of all guilds, all players, using same gear  essentially, and everything being max ac, weight 1, with specials,  this will create a lot of diversity, especially considering that the guilds can be made to utilize the changes very easily.  The file to look at is /open/earwax/armor.txt  Just send a reply, not reply all, or post, I'll be sharing all feedback with the other admins and whatnot.  This is a major deal, so please send your feedback.  -earwax **"
