messages "rowe**Subj: my cube roxCc: (To: vertebraker) roweDate: Apr 20 09:05Hey just wanted to say I think the cube is cool but was wondering if you could or if you cared if I modified it some.  Nothing as far as dmg inflicted or anything, was just wondering since I'm usually in the shadows if the cube could be invis to others in general or if a maybe stealth mode could be added so I could toggle whether others saw it.  Just figured I can't sneak up on anyone if  "A green cube (cloating) floats in." pops up. Let me know.  Thanks. ;)  Rowe **vertebraker** Re:   my cube roxDate: Apr 20 13:09i'll fix it today **"
