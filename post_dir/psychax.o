In any case, that's what this is about.  The way I see it, PK is lacking for the following reasons:Risk without rewardPulling kills without a gangbang - people run/quit instead of dyingLearning curve is steep...it's harsh to learn, and dying sucksPK without risk sucks - rangers just get another ranger to kill them     and unset their pk - we've all seen this heh     (that was just an example, other guilds do it of course)PK tends to be dominated by packs - shards together, ninja together, etcSimply no reason to set - why bother, don't get anything from itLow playerbaseThose are the primary issues, at least that I can come up with right now.If there are others, let me know, but I think those are the core problems.What I'm looking for is suggestions to either reduce those issues, eliminate them, or encourage pk in other ways.  Any ideas are helpful,I'm not looking for 'pk sucks oh well' or so-and-so is a flap bastard,I'm looking for well, how about we have this.... or could we do this...Some of my own thoughts:Shards will revitalize pk at least initially - they will hit the mud     with a vengeance, and give others someone to kill, and reason to.We need some pk-required-to-enter areas and pker-only gear.We need a rewards system for pkers (something I hope to help with the     pk tracker at some point).We need either lower risk (but still some risk) or greater rewards in     general for pk. More players - better noob retention/training, more stuff and reason     for current players, especially bigger ones to play more.     To attract and retain more players.More PK required guilds - shards, future assassins (former Deathmonger     assassins), possibly a good-aligned, physical guild to oppose     shards/ninja.Anyways, those are my thoughts on what the issues are, and ways to resolve them.  What we need is more complete ideas, hell, any ideas,and for those of you with wizards, hopefully a willingness to codesome things for it.  I know I at least was primarily playing here forpk...and I know others (particularly those with shards) did and do aswell, so let's figure out some things to increase it.  Verte will goalong with anything reasonable I imagine, and do what he can to helpand improve it - this is coming from him btw.  I'm looking for player and wizard contributions, either/or, I just want to do what I can to improve things, so even if it's dumb lemmeknow it :)**linus**Subj: LaptopCc: (To: earwax) dakeyras,forbin,mosobp,humble,pestilence,fred,mizan,jareel,coldwind,pike,cerberus,subotai,cooper,hoyle,sundin,greymir,symbio,fakir,snakespear,zeus,mode,wocket,jaraxle,vital,ravennight,blade,tony,usagi,psychax,entreriDate: Jun 16 14:43FIX THE FUCKING LAPTOP!!!!!!!Nothing is more frustrating than to see all these candy asses get uber high levels just so they can't be seen by the laptop.  This enables them to have a huge advantage if they choose to pk...being able to hunt invis players lower than them, and if they choose not to, gives them free run of any pk areas with little to no risk of being seen there.Go back to having to letting it see all levels, and have it run on batteries that cost $$ and run out over time.This will at least put most everyone on a more level playing field.  Cash is so easy to come by anymore, it's not like buying batteries will be a pain in the ass.This could also prevent people from waiting until they're +75 to finally set pk.Other than that, we just need more incentive...some it's just the adrenaline rush/ego stroke that works, but to actually pull people that normally wouldn't pk in, there's gotta be less risk, more reward.Maybe less of a death penalty...1/8 xp instead of 1/3?  Also maybe a no loot thing.  This way there's no fear of losing that Gordie stick that you had to suck off a +100 for or whatever.  Most of the pkers give shit back anyway, unless the victim is a whiny little bitch or just a plain asshole, but if there's a definate no loot thing, maybe people will be more likely to try.Ok..this would lead to a "Why the fuck should I pk if I don't get anything for it?"Good question.  How about a reward system based on pk points.  Both the MK-Scar and PK-trakker assign points for various pks.  Now say I had 250 pk points.  I could go to the uber-bsness-pk shop and lay down those points to buy some kickass pk only weapon and/or armor.  With less to lose being pked, and some nice rewards for the successful pkers, maybe more people will sign on.Just some thoughts, and sorry if it's all jumble-fucked to read.Linus**humble**Subj: Spam mailingDate: Jun 20 21:08  okay well I appreciate the feedback not the spam mail. mail me once. ONCE ONCE ONCE ONCE.    2nd off.  being realistic, the whole dcing thing, no running, etc, etc. the no whining/excuses when you kill someone or die.  all that stuff is just part of the game, part of the deal.  everyone will always whine/dc/cry about spam when they get killed in order to defend their ego, you've done it yourself.        The pk buffs is great, i agree also with the gangbang. In order to eliminate gangbangs I think buffs are needed.  hence when it's a 2 on 1, you give the 1 a handicap. obviously.  aside from that the rest of the lot is a whole lot of crazy ideas heh.  thanks for the feedback, although you only need to mail it once.**"
