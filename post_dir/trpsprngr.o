messages "flash**Subj: Pk in guildCc: (To: mizan) trpsprngr,wrenDate: Apr 27 13:21hey,  this is flash/vertebraker. i started playing in your guildagain, and i still understand _why_ we have the no-pk-zone rule.but i think especially nowadays, with the fact that pk-zones areused by wizards in planning their areas, and with the jump in xp(4x?!) required for the guild, i think it might be nice toopen us up for pk zones. not for pk itself. but so we can exploreand do more quests.  At least four quests that I can think of offthe top of my head (wastelands, two fiendsville quests, snow's dark arena)and actually, snow's other quest and eurale's despoina quest, as wellas the elemental test and mortal kombat all rely on pk-zones for theplayer to go through.  in addition to the quests and tests, the playeralso as of now, cannot go through:derellia iv (maledicta)mythos's tower within his forestfiendsvillezeus's museumdark citythe wastelandswocket's dryant graveyardfeld's sparring arena, and any tournamentssnow's shadowgatesnow's dark arenachaos. . . and perhaps others that i may have left out.This is 10+ areas that the player can't even go through.  I think thata hard coded protection against PK, not only on the lib valid_attackfunction, but also in the polymorph spells, can stop Pk if you would likeit to.  i believe there is no sense in the continuance of a years old rulethat may have lost its meaning when we look at the sheer amount of pkareas nowadays and how the player is expected to deal with them.the absurdity of the rule is that many players are oblivious to themyriad items and equipment afforded to them by these "dangerous"areas.i cc'd this to our active "GC's" in hopes of gaining their support~flash**mythos** Re:   Poly tugDate: May 24 09:35i intend to take a good look at it when i have time this weekend- Mythos**dazed**Subj: problemCc: (To: wren) summer,trpsprngrDate: Dec  4 15:37 Summer has been a part of killing the mob that guards my guildhall door.. Invading my guild and helping destroy our guild NPC, directly effecting our guild. This must stop, I am VERY familuar with Poly guild rules Mizan set. As a newly placed poly GC I hope she isnt trying to set an example for the rest of the guild. It is sure to lead to a guild war.. polys cant pk, but can be lured into pk.. this is exactly what Mizan wanted to avoid, 1 stupid Polymorph sayin things like "its only 120k to me, they shouldnt put him there if they dont want him killed" totally ignoring what Mizan demanded out of ANY Poly, muchless the guild commander. think about it mail me -dazed**vertebraker**Subj: hehDate: Apr  5 12:28can you get a hold of wren? let me know :)oh, btw, hi!verte**vertebraker** Re:   supDate: Oct 29 15:32nah, i quit .. email me at tmieczkowski@gmail.com**worm**Subj: hehDate: Jan  1 23:47 stillin kickin it  you? **"
