messages "vital**Subj: Dakeyras/Badman et alCc: (To: aingeal) dakeyras,badman,mizan,vitalDate: May 27 15:27Thu May 27 14:44:19 2004Aingeal,I am referring this over to you in your capacity as theliason between players and wizards. At roughly the abovedate-time, there were a series of interactions betweenplayers Rek and Badman. Neither showed any level of overtcompetence in dealing with conflict. The basis for thediscussion is irrelevant, regardless. Rek logged off andDakeyras logged in and managed to do some fairly stupidthings including jailing Badman.Badman has been recompensated for anything he lost and issatisfied. Dakeyras has been reprimanded and notified ofhis obligations as a wizard. In the end, I think we havea monumental display of stupidity and intolerance createdby a set of bad external stimuli.At this point, I would suggest follow up with an eyetoward reminding people that they need to generally justdeal with their RL problems elsewhere and try to educateand tolerate the incompetent people they are surroundedby.Mizan will probably be mailing you other salient detailsas well. We were also both peripherally involved in tryingto moderate the conflict.Vital**"
