This is more of an FYI than anything, to keep for posterity i guess.

I busted crip for having two players logged in at once, only i made a mistake
and compared the wrong players altogether. Crip is not southstar, but Crip
is Blade which is what i structured my SQL query as. Big mistake on my part!

In either case i did have a lingering doubt somehow and only took all his
EQ instead of outright prison. After checking my logs and realize the query 
itself was flawed i gave him his stuff back. Both him and i apologized on
channels to each other. I spoke with him a little bit afterwards and we
got to sort this out a bit more.

We decided on a mutual chillout.
I told him i would tell other wizzes to back off and leave him alone,
especially on channels. He in turn promised to keep a lower profile and not
let his RL issues be a focus for his acts of random anger.

He mentioned that certain wizzes seem to have been fucking around with him.
At the time he was not comfortable mentioning names, and i dont blame him.
It is possible that nobody has been harrassing him outright but with his
personality it doesnt seem like a stretch.

He mentioned he would come forward to me about it if the harrassment
continued. Just a heads up...

Silly idea .. Race / Guild theme

Advanced Processing Unit

Constructed by Scientist at Inhell Inc.

When the new char selects the APU 'race' he/she/it is shipped to the manufactor to be 
constructed. Upon arrival the player shall be given a series of custom options to help
create what will become the base structure for their Robot. 

IE Options: Base Structure, Model 6900 Is a faster more agile base due to its light weight built from futuristic alloys, where as Model 6969 is a larger, slower more heavily built base.. allowing 
additional weapon and armor mounts. Most Models can support a built in compartment that acts
simular to a bag, although with this unit installed, the
they cannot take advantage of one of their armor mounts. You know.. shit like that.

crappy spacing, i know.. im lazy so i cut and paste it from word.
old idea i had, thought i might toss out there *snicker*
i know some may think "duh, thats the cyberninas." but they'd be wrong..
 the race / guild idea locks them in and would be more based from true Robots
 rather than cyber enhanced ninjas. :)
 yes, the idea may still suck. but i was bored and high and came up with it.

I could not calm, I and a +40 dark order couldn't do any damage to it. and all in all it was funny at first but that's PURE BULLSHIT man and you fucking know it. Your cute jokes are jokes when kept at that. your fucking beanos are spammy and annoying, your little fucking toys are annoying, all in all make some tellblock or something so I don't have to get sprayed with shit and water balloons five times in a hb like has happened in the past. Your shit is too spammy and too much bullshit.  That agent best be worth 500k cause it's just plain a beast. i don't want your fucking beanos following me around, etc. please make some way wehre they can't follow you around and throw shit at you if you have tellblock on, like mouzar did with his kooshballs. I'd appreciate that, and maybe a little not or warning somewhere about

>

>>The Short story:
Cleipa has not accepted the simple fact that my guild has some fairly simple
rules established for it, and if you don't like that, then too bad. The US
Constitution does not apply for it. Sorry. Tavern/bouncer rules in effect.
Now you make this generalized blanket accusation for which you have no
real case for. 

>>The Long story:
Southstar, L19+53 (his friend) arranged for a hitman style execution of a L9
player. SS admitted to it, and i gave SS the choice of punishment:

1) Quit the polymorphs, and the case is closed.
2) Stay in the guild but so long as he is in it, no polys can venture to
   PK enabled realms without suffering damage (5hp/hb).
He chose poorly. However the predicted effect after less than a day was that
he was pressured to quit the guild.

Cleipa now has the nerve to tell me that SS did nothing wrong, and that i am
in no position to decide this case. As far as i am concerned this is done.

Then Cleipa quits the guild voluntarily in a fairly pathetic display of
protest. What you essentially did was save me the task of banishing myself.

Fascinating!

Wow, is this really the same issue that has dragged on for 2+ years?
I remember Fakir going 'oh shit' about it, and Boltar saying 'leave me
out of this fucking mess' when it last happened. Like August, 2001.

Okay, so when i pasted some of the things that moadeep's char had
said, such as an item about "leaving her alone is not an option", 
and the stuff about the blood bond, he went positively fliptastic.

I will see about his side of the story, but so far, it walks like a duck.

Hmm, this saga continues. /open/mizan/moadeep_part5.txt

In a nutshell, he wants to be freed, but is slipping more into
insanity. He just keeps using the same defense of 'wanting to be
left alone and play the game' but not look at any of the stuff 
he has been doing/saying.

For the record (i know you're aware of this) but over Thanksgiving
weekend moadeep had told Tarken that he was going to hijack a gas
tank truck and ram it into his ex's house. Tarken and Star talked
him out of it apparently. Whew.

On a random note, i discovered that players when using the chat
line do not get logged to file. This is mainly because of the close
interaction it has with player.c

This explains the gaps in logging that i had been seeing. I'll see
if i can address this issue.

You (tumbleweed, doolotz) had a hard time getting to the point yesterday
that Wendy is harrassing Dave by sending odd pics of herself. Well guess
what? It has no bearing on the game. That's right, none. That is happening
outside of the mud. She could be sending pics of herself having sex with a
herd of elephants just to get doolotz pissed, but again, that has zero
practical involvement with us. She could be tattooed and swasticas and
enjoying herself at a Japanese Bukkake cumfest, and i wouldn't really give
a damn. Why? Cos it's happening OFF the mud and there is nothing that i
see from her behavior on the mud that warrants her getting banned.

You on the other hand, Doolotz:
1) Harrassing Wendy's chars
2) Lying to my face repeatedly about stopping your behavior.
3) Breaking Pain's agreement to not create new characters to login.
4) Enlisting others to your cause of attacking this mud with a fork() attack.

End of story.

Doolotz, you are a waste of flesh. I had tried to remove all stimuli that
caused problems. I got Crip to stop messing with you. I managed to curb Data
and other wizzes that strongly dislike you. I avoided contact with you for
a period, and what happens? You make up new problems, which were previously
non-existent. That is why i have given up hope on you. YOU ARE A CRYBABY.

Your life is horribly misprioritized. You're homeless, jobless, and all you're
concerned about is mudding. How about an income? It's holiday season, people
will hire just about any able bodied person to do some work. And FYI Denny's
hires illegal fucking aliens to do the dishes, what do they care about a drug

Hey your mobs are cool i like the idea and everything, but when your mobs spam me, aggro attack me, pop in and out of a room to attack me. it's a bit much. if there was some way that i didn't have to deal with your mobs jsut randomly popping into a room i'm in and attackign me that'd be really awesome, it's becoming a big pain in the ass for me personally, not sure how other's feel they may LOVE getting attacked while idling at green then wasting tons of heals only for your mobs to run away then pop back into the room their in 10 minutes later to hit them 2 rounds and pop out then come back in hit them and pop back out.  without you getting a hit in. This could be true and yes the mobs are pieces of creative genius, but from one standpoint it's not very newbie friendly to be harassed by npcs.  i know we are doing better than elysium on playerbase but that's really not saying much at all.  ANyways if there could be some middle of the road deal that'd be cool
Cause some days i have high tolerance, other days i don't enjoy getting hit with shit 5 times in the same minute by 5 different mobs, then wandering around to have beavis and butthead follow me with their annoying says and emotes, only to have fettdogg and doctor sphincter or whatever his name is attack me, pop out of the room, then 10 minutes later show up with two goliath beanos and try to whomp me while i'm doing a quest. it's really annoying as fuck to be a player, i'm not sure if either of you have players but from my standpoint it kind of sucks and it seems to be getting worse as the days go by.  ANyways man, I really Appreciate you coming back and respect your work but try to understand that it is a bit much sometimes :)

Goliath attacked humble apparently
I helped him with his attacks after that, we kept dropping goliaths to 0 and they'd port out
I had them frozen (immobile) and them being able to port while immobilized is bs...
also, having them dead, on radio (which i gave to wax after about the third time)
it kept saying objective object dead for goliaths, summoning more goliaths, but 
them not dying...i think they should've certainly been dying
They were getting hit by a +81 black circle in max gear, using strength potions
a ghoul wielding air, and a dervish dual wielding sticks....that's insane damage, and 
staying at 0 for a round or long enough to port out means they should definitely
died....and constantly summoning more and more to hit, it's pretty bs imho

It's cool having them harrassing people and such, but when it breaks into attacks
and you can't do anything to them, it kinda crosses the line - especially when they
are doing hitfades and taking 100+ damage (in humble's case, in mine, i'm so
heavily armored that they weren't that big of a deal)

If they are an annoyance, is cool, but when you can't kill them, yet they can kill
you AND they loot your corpse AND they attack, it pretty much makes it no fun 
anymore I think.  I love the beanos and shit, but at that stage, when there are 5
goliath beanos and 3 of them minimum travelling together to whomp on us trying
to get humble's stuff back after they got him, and they won't die, even at 0
(for a perspective on damage, they were going from 0 to 7 to 4 or 3 to 0 back to 3
and then back to 0 and then porting back and getting more)
humble and bleh combined do absolutely horrific damage, especially considering
he's dualling the best saveables in the game and i'm wielding the best weapon in 
the game period (other than flexgun).  armored max, with damn near everything
on me offensive as well, AND a ghoul wielding air doing sick damage....

Anyways, that's my 2 cents, nothing has attacked me yet, other than the hitfades
after i started putting a hurt on goliaths.

And incidentally, EVERY time one or both of us dropped a goliath to 0, it said on 
wax's radio that target objective had died (goliath saying it) and so on...

Let me be one of the first to say thinks. Although I am not female, I have had to deal with his 'crap' for many years on here. At one point (for some reason) a large percentage of the females on here asked to be married to one of my chars. (thus my 30 chars) Once that happened he started pitting them against me by saying things to them about me. I know this because a couple of them told me he said things, they just knew better than to believe him. I also had to deal with 'Someone' kicking me over nad over from afar, which didn't take much to figure out who it was, and also the fact the he use to make mention of my alts to others, even if they were JUST created. It was impossible for me to keep a charachter secret. Which was one of the reasons I had to take off from here for awhile in the past. At times I just wanted to be left alone, and it couldn't be done.

Tonight Spore was caught moving equipment from one character (Sylic)

It wasn't a large amount of stuff but i waited for Angle to give the bag
before stealing it, and then lectured them in the Void.

Angle is not in trouble, but i made it a point that from now on the
contents of help multiple and help bots are expected to be fully understood.

Spore is no newbie, so he should get prison time. This isn't his first
offense, but possibly his first time ever caught by a wiz officially.
So... i had it in mind he should get a week in prison or so. That's up to
you guys though, either way i am supportive of whatever you as a group
suggest for prison time.

I have a feeling that Sunim did not know that he was being
used as a 3rd party proxy, but this is the kind of equipment flow that
is happening across seconds these days...

In case the format of the log is confusing- the first value is the time of
occurrence, followed up with the original player who 'cloned' the object,
followed by the filename, and then the new carrier of the object.

Date: Sep  5 21:04

This is the super-condensed version. A highly recommended read is in
/open/mizan/sep_05_2004.txt.

In a nutshell, Fastkill was caught today logging in as Moby (Billy).
When confronted, he lied about it. The ensuing carnage resulted in
most of Fastkill's chars being reduced to L1, as well as Billy and Moby.

Largely because of both player characters general ignorance and stupidity
this was allowed to happen. Vertebraker did a lot of the heavy lifting today
and i am thankful for both his and Forbin's help. The sep_05_2004.txt file
goes into much greater detail, it's about 3K long.

Fakir was witness to my first interaction with Fastkill, and can fill anyone
in on the generally benign level of it. After catching him two more times
over the week trying to do the same thing, my patience wore out. Verte hung
in as well, until it reached a point that nothing really good was going
to happen.

This was sent just to fill everyone in, since it was a fairly crazy run-and-gun

Happy,
I am calling a cease-fire between you and Mizan.  I asked him to release you from prison,
and not to target you with spam (although please keep in mind that a few beanos at green
do not necessarily constitute being targeted with spam).  For your part, I expect you to not
mention Mizan, either directly or indirectly, in any public or private tell unless you are trying
to respectfully get his assistance with something.  This conflict between the two of you 
appears to be escalating, and it needs to stop.  I will speak with you about this in person
as soon as possible to discuss the details with you.  Keep in mind that even otherwise 
innocent venting or sharing one's opinion can become harassing if done repeatedly or
in such a way as to target another after being asked to stop.  Neither of you is blameless
in this instance, and I believe the best way to deal with it is for both of you to cease 
non-essential contact, public or private, with each other.  
Please let me know when you will be available to talk about this in more detail.  I look 
forward to resolving this issue so that you can both go back to enjoying the game

Mizan - I just wanted to know how much longer this char was going
to be snooped?  Also I was wondering WHY I am being snooped?
I have done nothing illegal, I don't cheat, I do nothing that is
wrong, other than talking to Rick and his assorted chars, and
there is nothing else I can really think of that I do.  My
conversations with Rick should be of no concern to anyone else on
here, why they would be is beyond me.  
You said you wanted people to come straight to you if they had an
issue, so that is what I am doing.  However, I feel that by snooping
me for no good reason, you are doing what so pisses you off.  You
could have come to me if you had an issue with something you think
I may or may not be doing.  
These types of things are what drive players away.  Not comments made
on an open channel or in a private chat.  I have played here for 
years.  I had only one char for a long time, then decided to wiz that
char.  I now regret it because I think it has caused more problems
than pleasure for me.  I enjoy coding, but I do not enjoy the bullshit
that comes along with it.  I never had an issue with you, but if I
am going to be snooped for doing nothing wrong, I do have an issue with that.
I know you choose to not be level 200 or whatever, but you still have a lot
of the abilities that upper level wizzes have, such as snooping.  If I
was doing something wrong, snoop away, but the people I choose to speak 
with on here is not a valid reason to snoop me.  Or is it?  I won't
stop talking to the people I talk to because others don't like it. 
Look at how many people, including upper level wizzes, still talk to
Reflex.  Do they get this kind of grief?  I am very frustrated that the
place I come to for entertainment is turning into a place I now want
to avoid because I feel like every move I make is being logged.  I don't
do anything that I care if you see, I am not a mudsex freak, I don't 
cheat, etc.  However, if I want to speak freely about things in my personal
life, I don't feel that is anyone else's business.  If I wanted others to know,
I would have told them myself.  Do you see where I am coming from?
I dont' want to have conflict with you.  All I want to know is if I am 
going to continue to be snooped without good cause.  I just want this
to be a fun place to be again. Thanks for listening.

We wizards have, over the last several years, sanitized the mud.  By that 
I mean, we have driven off, or otherwise made it unsavory for certain undesirable 
players to play here.  Yet, if you consider what makes a game fun to play, 
it is in many ways those same undesirable characters who actually add a 
certain 'spice' to the game for players, as well as wizards.  I considered the 
wizard base we now have and thier ability or even need to deal with people 
like Worm.  For the most part, there is no need to deal with him.  He cannot 
really harm any facet of the game, other than to perhaps take advantage of 
regen 25 
dem chett bug in some piece of code.  Well, so what.  Big deal.  Its a game, and 
sooner or later we would catch the bug and fix it. However, without players 
like Worm, Symbio, Kazer, etc. (you get my drift) the game itself loses a 
certain aspect it used to have...and the best word I can think of to describe 
that aspect is 'spice'.  Like eating potato soup with no salt, it just does 
not taste good...and nobody wants any.  In a nutshell, I felt the risk of 
letting Worm, and others like him, back here to play was worth a shot at  
getting ppl to play again in a mud where they have to deal with adversity 
in the form of players like that.  It may be a bad call, but at this point, 
I am not sure it will matter if it is, as oftain, there are only two ppl 
logged in here at a time anyhow.  Time will tell, and its as easy to banish 
him again as it was to let him back.  The line Wizards should draw in  
dealing with him, as well as other ppl like him, is if they annoy or  
otherwise harrass another player to the point THEY cannot play.  That 
cannot nor should not be tollerated.   
I notice an alias messed up a line in this post...but I think it will  
still make sense.  Damn alias's and zmud! :)

Veeshan did apologize to me. He didnt say I needed to let anyone know. 
His apology was weak. I asked a few questions about why he said 
that a top lvl wiz asked him to do it and his reply didnt make sense. 
If he hadnt been cheating he would have spoken up when I called it  
out on star. He's just sorry he got caught. The lies themselves contradict 
each other. Thanks and sorry, I didnt mean to stir up such 
mess. I dont want us to lose any players but it would be nice

i play from work so lots of times i just close my client becuase i dont 
have  time to save gear, sell ect before the boss walks in. i noticed that 
when that happened my heals were gone, then i noticed my coins were maxed 
at 200k. i took  me while to figure out what was happening but afterwards i 
did use it at times to build my clans monies. i cant stop the forced dc'ing 
if i play from work so i hope it gets fixed. i did tell a wiz 
(unofficially) about it and got the impression it was known about. it was 
bad judgement on my part and i accept my punishment. not quite the best 
timing, coming on the heels of the wiz cheating incident. i dont know what

in the open accepting my punishment. getting question, chastized, punished 
or anything else by an invis wiz is just unfair to the players. i

I banished his wiz.  This was due to a lot of distrust on him, and  
then some discussion with him.  He's done an extremely large number 
of commands to determine player locations, etc, as his wiz, and statall, 
and other commands, and done all sorts of other things, including 
reading weapon files, etc, none of which have anything do do with 
his wiz position, but everything to do with his player position. 
Then, he lied to me about the actions he did as pestilence when I  
was personally snooping him: he lied about what he did, tells he sent, 
and his motivations (which were extremely obvious to me in light of 
his situation as a pc).  He lied repeatedly, he's done less than  
nothing as a wiz, meaning his only impact has been negative.

Pestilence was dewizzed and put to -1.  I'm not sure the exact reason, 
Dhalek never gave me one, other than asking why my wiz was in the cyber 
guild hall and knights guild hall. So i would like to apologize for my bad 
judgement and stupidity.  I had my wiz "pestilence" in those areas because 
i thought it would be funny for my char Archangel's clan rooms to match 
those of certain guild rooms.  I also abused my power as a wiz by looking 
at the 7inn area of tallos to find the hidden exits and I "stat" my 
character a few times.   I know this was wrong and therefore I'm sorry for 
those actions.   What i never did is anyway do anything to benefit my 
characters with the actions of my wizard, other than gaining knowledge and 
using it to find places to go.  And i do now realize this was wrong. I'm 
not asking to be rewizzed, I realize using information gained by your 
wizard by your player character is wrong. 
 
Though i have been told of others doing the same thing and nothing has 
happened to them.  And being put to -1 seems like a harsh punishment for 
the crime that has occured.  So if there is some other charge on me, I 
would really like to know what it is i'm accused of doing.  I appreciate 
all the work that everyone has done here, and Nirvana has been a part of my 
life for a long time, it  saddens me that I have let you all down. 
 
 Also i know that the code of pestilence's areas belongs to nirvana, but 
the artistic properties belong to me and i would greatly appreciate it if 
they would be removed from the game for the time being Thanks Blake aka 
Pestilence etc 
 
 any questions or if there is another reason that i dont know of for my 
dewizzing please contact me preferrably by email if that's ok

It looks like Netvision 013/Barak has some problems with their end of the network. 
There are some misconfigured- or perhaps deliberatemisaligned routers

Note that the two hops at the 013 border router po1-3.bk3-bb.013bk.net are messed up. 
I believe this is in Tel Aviv, where the handoff to Telia/Global Crossing is made. 
So the problem seems to be centered there, and it may be a deliberate strategy where 
outbound traffic is scrubbed a little bit, to prevent network attacks into the 
zone where Israeli citizens would be affected. 
 
ICMP checksum errors indicate some sort of packet loss that is inherently beyond 
the control of Nirvana's network, and thusly we really can't be held accountable for it. 
 
All of the access times from hop 1 to hop 8 are fairly fast, and well under the 5ms 
average. 206.71.144.170 is a transit for an OC192 connection, running at a full 8Gbit.

I just spoke to my cousin (who is in Bersheba) and she confirmed some of the problems 
that are in play. Apparently Netvision acquired 013/Barak recently. Bittorrent traffic 
seems to be dropping pretty badly, and Skype no longer seems to have proper QOS so packets 
drop, although when she turns up the bitrate things improve. 
 
You should check the news on your side. Apparently the Netvision acquisition of 013/Barak is 
really fucking up their infrastructure. A lot of people are complaining, and it really 
isnt anything that we can do unfortunately. So i take back my assessment that there is some 
inherent security in misreporting ICMP ping traffic. 
It seems like all hell is going on for people who were former 013/Barak subscribers.

Dude, you lied to me. I saw you do something with my own eyes and when

that this was all over some minor stuff that shouldnt have been of any 
consequence- a minor issue. But now i can't trust you. If you're going 
to lie about something silly (like who took the last beer) then how can 
I count on you when something major comes up? 
 
I still think that you being banned outright was too harsh, but the 
amount of spin you're putting on your side of the story is steadily 
making me feel like EW did the right thing.

me in this, but i can say when you think i lied, your are assuming 
my intent, and noone knows my intent but me so it's not factual. 
And i honestly don't think i've put any spin on my side, everyone 
who has spoken to me about it i told them that i broke the rules 
and i was definitely guilty. 
I really feel bad that you don't trust me, And I would do anything 
to gain the trust back.  I don't know what would bring things 
to my satisfaction, but no matter what i have done, I don't 
think that it's right for a high lvl wiz to be telling people 
they shouldn't talk to me, talking to others like they are his 
children, and making slanderous remarks about people.  That 
is improper personal etiquette on the game and real life. 
 
  If i was given a chance, I would like to proof myself worthy, 
my possible suggestion, if you deem i'm worthy of this chance, 
is possibly gain lvl 21 pending a new area, and being a productive 
part of the game, and if that isn't met, in a certain time frame 
automatic demotion, banishment, whatever you seem fit.  I would 
want the decision in your hands, but not in Earwax, for as you 
say you can't trust me, I feel the same but worse, for earwax, 
a former roommate of his told me many things he said about me 
in the past as well.  I thank you for taking time to respond

What is it exactly that you want? For people to treat you like a king 
and spoon feed you everything? For there to be nothing that can harm 
people on the game? There are relatively young people who play here 
(teenagers) and they know better than to go into a PK area because 
they were told not to, or that they learned not to do so unless they 
had a lot of weapons and gear. 
What is it that you are looking for? I am serious. This game has 
real hazards, and if you are going to come back here each time and 
create drama, it might be better for your own well being and mental 
health to choose a game which does not provide these sort of frustrations. 
 
It is completely unfair of you to come here and make messes that I have 
to clean up. You logging as Norbit and trying to frame the players on this 
MUD as being unhelpful to a newbie- that's just total bullshit and very 
immature on your part. I just had to try and calm down someone who was 
trying to help you and explain to them that someone was just being 
a drama queen. 
 
If you wish to continue these sort of outbursts, I highly recommend that

not cause such emotional outrage.

Well, after thinking about it.. when he logged in this time, 
I personally chose not to just execute his char. I figured theres 
1 really great way to truely piss him off. To see him die over and 
over fair and square. Not only does he boast of being able to  
'Hack the Planet!' or whatever that lame crap he talks about is, 
mud security, mizans chars! blah blah blah.. he talks about how 
he's the best pker ever! the best player / tank in the game!  
etc etc. It's stupid.. and personally, i'd love to see him have 
his face rubbed in it. So tonight, I set him up to die to Equilibrium. 
He died in 2 rounds.. it was amusing.. he wasnt happy. 
Now he says he has 'reason to play and get even' .. heh 
This should be funny. 
On a more serious note.. he did say again that if he wanted to, 
his hacking of the mud and shit would be done. He seems quite sure. 
Now, I KNOW he's full of shit about pk and playing.. but the hacking 
crap i'll just have to trust you guys when you say he's no threat.

You quit out of the game while I was trying to diagnose an issue for

bullshit. This was your last tell: 
 
22:35:04 Hawkman tells you: my point is its not right and it shows someone is 
messing with things they shouldnt be 
 
Can you prove this? I am not messing with you because quite frankly you are not 
worth the time for me to mess with. I do not mess with people like you because 
there is frankly no real motivation to do so. It is not rewarding, and the fact 
that you whine about anything and everything makes it rather annoying on top 
of it all. For the record, while you were pestering me with tells, I was 
busy, preparing the new server which will replace the current machine 
that this game runs on. I don't appreciate your sass and 
as a directive to anyone else who cares to listen, I will only 
say this: Everyone, please ignore Whitehawk and any of his 
characters unless you are prepared to devote ALL and EVERY IOTA of  
attention to his well being, his desires, and all of his general 
wants. Which for most of us (since we are not paid 
and do this for the fun of it)... will be NEVER. 
 
There is no wizard conspiracy against you, because I will speak for 
many if not all- We consider your whining presence simply not worth 
the effort. We have other things to conspire about, such as what to do 
with Jimmy Hoffa's entombed corpse in Giants Stadium when the facility 
is scheduled for demolition. It's really a fucking pain in the 
ass because while ALL of us were present when his tattered, bloated 
corpse was dumped unceremoniously into the cement- none 
of us are sure of EXACTLY where he is buried. 
 
SO PLEASE forgive us if we dont respond right away to your princely 
presence (within 2 seconds) because right now the loss of Hoffa's exact location is fucking 
Khrell's fault, and he still hasn't paid me back for those beers. 
 
Yours sarcastically,
