I am sitting here wondering what is going on numerous members of Bf are askin up plz dont attack seht cuz they are members of ranger alliance and yet we still do it. I think we need to set something up as far as rules go to set those limits. Twice now I have been on and witnessed either the killing of guild npc's or someone trying to kill the center
