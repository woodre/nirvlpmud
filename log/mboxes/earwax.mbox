Laf.  That'd be funny.  I've never thought of mutations 
I guess.  Best I've thought of is things like ADD or 
mentally challenged.  Your kid attacks but just stops after a few rounds  and  
roams off in search of dirt or somehthing.  Mentally challenged ones we could 
get to attack themselves, or pets, other kids, the parent idea.
