ok the fact that you have created roaming mobs that steal kills and loot corpses 
of fallen mobs is total bullshit.... and the fact that if you try to kill them 
to get what you fairly earned and get killed because they r impossible to kill 
is also bullshit.  i had just killed a xetra in the blue crystal when domo-kun 
came into the crystal and looted the corpse before i could even type my aliases for 
corpse sacrifice and take all. 
I then preceded to try to kill him and take my stuff back and lasted for quite 
a few rounds before he started really pounding me.  i tried to run to my casa room  
and the fucker followed me all the way there killed me and took MY shit 
How those mobs r even legal is beyond me. I am requesting for all my equipment 
back and the coins i had on me at the time which was about 45000 or so 
and that those mobs not be allowed to continue to follow players around to loot 
the corpses that the players have legally killed.

the equipment i had on me at the time of my death was the complete set of thunder 
air,ted skates,natures orb,blocker,golden earring,gogetas ring which i don't care 
about since it was crafted for gogeta for some reason or other,shield of tears 
flowing scarf,grey sash, and i believe that was all 
I feel that is only fair considering what had happened 
Thank you in advance if this can be accomplished. 
I am sure you all know the rest of my alts if i am on  another character at the  
time just let me know if i get my stuff back and i will log this one in.

When I receive messages from people with thinly veiled threats or 
outright call me out as being incompetent one of three things happens: 
1) They are quietly deleted and ignored 
2) They are posted up on our wiki for mockery across the wiz population 
3) I get mad and do something irrational about it. 
 
In your case, I present to you two options: 
a) Recompose your request in a more palatable and polite way. 
b) Suck it up and deal with the consequences of your actions. 
 
There are things on this MUD which present a hazard or menace to all 
player characters, but one thing that they have in common is that YOU 
would have to do something or explore somewhere to provoke it. 
 
I reserve the option to continue along with options 2) and 3) if  
the situation requires it.

i am sorry about my mail to you i wrote that while i was very pissed off.  For that  
I am sorry.  Now that i have had time to cool off I humbly request that w/e you can 
/will do will be greatly appreciated.  As far as the provoking I did no such thing 
all i did was kill the xetras in the Blue crystal. After i killed one of them 
domo-kun looted the corpse.  Had i known that he was not the pushover of some of 
your other mobs i would never had attacked him to begin with.  After realizing that  
he was not the pushover like some of your mobs are i tried to run but got followed 
all the way to my casa room and was killed.This is not a character i play very  
often and the equipment I had was VERY hard to come by as well as as the coins that 
would have been provided from the crystals that the xetras drop.  I needed those 
coins as i had very little to start off with.  But with that being said I will 
close this with another apology and a request of at least have the mobs that are on  
pillage mode not be able to touch something someone has killed for a few heartbeats 
to give the player time to at least get off there aliases for corpse drain and take  
all 
Thank You

I would have preferred that he did not send that sort of mail to you, 
but he does raise some valid points. If possible let's chat about this, 
there's no need to blow this up at either him or anyone else. 
I see it entirely possible that this can be discussed rationally. 
Thanks,
