[Mar 10 2006 07:14] A: Registered Test Character: Shaade
[Mar 21 2006 17:37] A: Registered Test Character: Glaare
[Mar 21 2006 21:51] A: Had stardrifter testing for me
[Mar 21 2006 21:53] A: Disarm function of bwo_template caused fallen to drop their guild object
[Mar 21 2006 21:53] A: Cloned guild object back to stardrifter
[Apr 22 2006 11:28] A: Registered Test Character: Swallow
[Sep 19 2006 00:48] A: Fixed /players/maledicta/cont/mobs/tower.c
[Dec 13 2006 21:00] A: /players/sparrow/areas/bwo/npc/bwo_template.c approved by Vertebraker, loads when my castle loads only, loads to a random room, /players/maledicta/cont/rooms/444,771,109,892,887 | /players/earwax/area/fields/room/tunnel3 | /players/jaraxle/cont/rdragon/rooms/pond2. During reset will move again to a random room from same array. Randomly generated statistics, hp, lev, wc, ac, multiple attack functions in /players/sparrow/areas/bwo/include.mob_funcs.c, disarm, break weapon, changes target, also affects preggo attackers and effectively removes preggo. Clones random number of randomly generated accessory armor, template is /players/sparrow/areas/bwo/obj/bwo_acc.c, also approved by Vertebraker
[Dec 16 2006 01:35] A: Fixed bug with /players/sparrow/areas/bwo/npc/bwo_template.c that would cause the mob to become unresponsive after switching to a target with hp < 1 and the creature dies at end of round
[Dec 16 2006 19:33] A: Finding that my monk is too easy for the experience that it hands out. On average it is giving 85k xps. Dropped that to around 65k and increased potential damage output by about 40%. Also changed the disarm function so that 33% of the time, the monk will steal the opponent's weapon when disarmed. That should even things out a bit.
[Dec 16 2006 21:32] A: file permission issues with using write_file to write my logs, switched to log_file. Log file for black willow monk is /log/sparrow.bwm
[Dec 17 2006 01:31]

[Jan  7 2007 07:15] A: changed /players/snow/heals/ice_sphere.c to display result of heal in message to player, also added a small bit of color. Original is named ice_sphere_presparrow.c in same directory
[Jan  8 2007 11:20] A: copied fran's original entrance.c back to be the active file and renamed my entrance.c to entrance_sparrow.c. It seems that there are some issues with the room cleanup that causes some sensitive mind notices.
[Jan 14 2007 20:28] A: Fixed barter function on Angel's P90 machine gun
[Feb  8 2007 00:12] A: added 2.5 mil of xp to achilles and 2.3 mil xps to nyteshade for a death bug caused by an object that I will report next

[Mar 11 2007 00:30] A: Fixed syntax error in /players/mythos/closed/guild/forest/mon/dread.c that caused it not to load.
