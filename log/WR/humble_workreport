[Aug 12 2004 12:56] A: THU Aug 12. Fury is giving eweapons, earmor and stanley cup rings to avant, who is lloyd. avant is holding them for fury's alternate character.
[Aug 24 2004 13:35] A: I was watching Swiss/Avant and Avant logged in then Swiss was created, had tons of egear and other items. He also reported to me that he was abusing a bug and showed me what it was. see bug logs. after 15 minutes of age he had a load of gear, see mizan's wlog about that one or ask him about gear, I jailed him simply for abusing bugs.
[Aug 24 2004 14:13] A: Bug abused by swiss is as follows. '/players/fakir/inn/OBJ/purse1.c' as well as 'purse2.c, purse3.c' these purses can be dropped, stored in a hotel room or pushed in the ether muck in mizan's jello, then restored or tugged, take purse, open purse, snatch coins, drop purse, push/store purse, tug/restore purse, take purse, open purse, snatch coins, drop purse. repeat. and you have millions of coins with a macros or a 6 alias system. see bug report about it as well. I would just recommend making these items unstoreable
