[Jun 10 2007 21:54] A: gave worm a ton of crap that i shouldnt have had to but he didnt know the mud was on a 12 hour reboot and needed some more Oxycontin to get bizadooed.
[Jun 15 2007 01:37] A: warned troy not to swap EQ with krokus
[Jun 15 2007 01:38] A: consider him warned :) i did not do anything i.e. imprisonment or stat correction etc
[Jun 30 2007 21:09] A: for some reason recusant was set to login in Mythos' forest. Fixed to village green.
[Jul  4 2007 14:11] A: for some reason dameon is a samurai. That has been fixed
[Jul  6 2007 22:06] A: warned garland (zidane) not to use shops to swap equipment. Noticing a general trend of players using obscure shops to xfer objects or using very fast transfers
[Aug  6 2007 15:24] A: oops, forgot to mention this from earlier- sent a mudmail to all of volkar's chars asking for his side of the story about being caught abusing a reimbursement bug. he did fess up to it, but also named a wiz that he had confided in as 'reporting' the bug
[Aug  6 2007 15:25] A: after asking him who the wiz was, he gave me attitude because i was invis. I went vis, imprisoned one of his chars to prove a point- that he was in no position to bargain. he named chip. So then i released the char (kosh). Well now he decided to login all his chars an inactive them.
[Aug  6 2007 15:26] A: As per usual situation, assignment of blame to something unrelated is the issue (he's pissed off that i was invis, not that he was caught abusing a bug).
[Aug  7 2007 17:28] A: adjusted goten's attribs at his request- strength and stamina down to 30 from 34
[Aug 15 2007 02:14] A: reset dameon as a member of necro guild, set his guild_file appropriately
[Aug 15 2007 13:43] A: rmed /players/catwoman/storage/crip as he was passing equipment again
[Aug 18 2007 17:21] A: i gave soul his exp back, lost from a DC combat situation. Told him it was a freebie and that this sort of thing is generally not reimbursed
[Aug 21 2007 21:25] A: there seem to be problems with shardak and rooms in /players/zeus/realm/city/
[Aug 21 2007 21:25] A: shardak assume an id of 'demon' which causes hell with those rooms, that spawn and generate demons and stuff
[Aug 21 2007 21:26] A: killed Tembo by accident by transing him from aforementioned area into the village church. Not smart on Mizan's part. Reimbursed EXP.
[Aug 23 2007 22:53] A: Registered Test Character: Sput
[Aug 24 2007 19:10] A: forbin promoted to L90, restored his player character- for some reason he was not able to login beyond password authentication state
[Aug 26 2007 12:07] A: made changes to mages pacify (/players/pavlik/guild/mages/pacify.c) and the guild object gob.c to break the 'pacify' command spell when stacked up in combat.
[Aug 26 2007 12:07] A: fakir caught teferi abusing this, we ffixed this one together, with his testing and input. Woo!
[Aug 26 2007 14:40] A: it probably needs to be made clear about the withdrawal policy at the nirvana bank... that once the funds are in and a reboot has passed, you can't get anything else back
[Aug 28 2007 10:18] A: added a line in /players/earwax/bank/bank.c in addition to what was already there, to clarify for n00bs to use 'help bank'
[Aug 31 2007 01:23] A: i probably crashed the mud. Gave out a metric asston of equipment and heals
[Sep  3 2007 15:01] A: updated sign in /players/mokri/clans/hall.c with warning that poor clan names will be deleted without warning
[Sep  3 2007 15:02] A: corrected 'capial' to capital in said room
[Sep  5 2007 00:21] A: gave mrjones some exp back from a PK gangbang because his soul/quicktyper fragged on him
[Oct  7 2007 19:50] A: adjusted tara and becka's gold from 200k coins to 20 coins as part of the situation with the disconnect money bug. Angel was the one who has found the bug...
[Oct  7 2007 19:50] A: we still dont know why it has happened though.
