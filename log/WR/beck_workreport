Sun Sep 27 14:18:37 1998--Action: raised the weapon bonus to 2*karatelevel (2-18) and adjusted cost to match it.  Follows spell_object rules same as before.  everything was slightly scaled up at an equal ratio. Reason: I had taken out the origional blaster spell which was origionally approved.  I just changed this to now equal that.  A solution to the fact I dont want guild members 'casting' spells.

Tue Jun 15 21:35:58 1999--Action: for ranger guild separated personal power from common power.  personal power has to be regenerated from inside the guild hall, and is still drawn from pool power.

Sun Nov 21 23:43:57 1999--Action: Changed kill function so alignment check does not apply to PK Reason: Many enemies of rangers used potions and other artificial means to prevent rangers from attacking them.  I dont feel the alignment is appropriate for players, because it can be falsly manipulated.
Sat Apr 22 05:23:19 2000--Action: Put in code for the new command center Reason: This provides base code for my future modifications.  Currently all functionality is the same with the exception that guiild power is now stored, so it can be saved over reboot.  There is still a max of 3000.
