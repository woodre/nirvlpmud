Aug 21 21:32 :: cleaned out some logs
Aug 21 21:39 :: >>>>> Mode was executed by Snow a while back. After much deliberation, I have decided to give Mode the benefit of the doubt in his long explanation. I am restoring him to 1/2 guild level - 1/2 belt level - and 1/2 credits. This is  only half a restore of what Mode was,  and it is half of a  and it is less xp than Mode would  end up  woulill end up with after leaving the Shards. So in the end, I believe this is warranted because Mode ends up changing guilds, becoming of less guild level than in the Shardak, and ends up with less xp and lower player level.
Aug 21 22:10 :: Mode -> set art level to 9 out of 17 levels, set quality level to 5 out of 10, set credits to a total of 250k which is enough to restore 2 out of 5 of his weapon links and to leave a remaining credit balance of 100k out of 200k max. Also set Mode's weapon to Naginata.
