[May 30 2009 00:26] A: Kyria asked me where to get a bottomless bag, I wasnt sure, I went to check at pass. I bought one, found out I was right, told her where to go, she went, I had bought the last one, they cost 5k. I told her to give me the 5k, she did, I dropped the bag I had bought, she grabbed it. Just reporting it so noone thinks I cheated. Thanks.. and Sorry if it was any trouble.
