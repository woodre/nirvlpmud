Tue Jun  1 07:19:49 1999--Action: Cloned a sword and handed it to Trebor Reason: Consulted with Eurale about his sharpening stones not working, and since Trebor had already bought 3 stones I asked Eurale if I should clone Trebor a new stone while Eurale worked on fixing the problem.  Eurale said ok, so I cloned him a new sword, gave it to him, dested the old sword, and took and dested one of Trebor's sharpening stones.
Tue Jun  8 21:15:21 1999--Action: Gave Eurale's phbs to Lacar Reason: There was a problem with a file change Eurale made, and while trying to fix it, Maledicta said to try the replace command in her room.  It replaced the weapon, Eurale's phbs in the lacar.o file in the Templar room dir to the cookie.  So even when the sword code was fixed, she was out the sword.  So, I cloned one and gave it to her to replace the one deleted by the cookie created when the replace command was used.  Any questions, talk to me.
Mon Jun 12 09:33:31 2000--Action: I cloned some items for Silverwolf, she, Cavalier, and then myself were all stuck in /players/boltar/templar/private and she couldn't get to her magic box.  I loaded and updated the room, which solved the bug but also cleaned the room's inv. The following is a cut and paste of what was in her box:  ->> Look /obj/discon Reason: 2423A magic box, only the right person can open it.The name silverwolf is on a small plastic tag on top of the box.Inventory of OBJ(obj/discon#2423) <-> A magical storage box 0: OBJ(players/saber/weapons/spiritsword#1510) <-> Sword of the Spirits  < wc 18,18 > 1: OBJ(players/mythos/prac/bag#616) <-> Bottomless Bag 2: OBJ(players/saber/armor/age#474) <-> Armor of the Ages  < ac 4, armor >That's all.
Mon Jun 12 09:37:45 2000--Action: Cloning (cont) Reason: I cloned the items from the previous entry to Silverwolf as there was a bug in /players/boltar/templar/private where Silverwolf, Cavalier, and myself were all trapped in the room.  We couldn't do anything, the room blocked all actions, even wizard commands.  Francesco was also stuck in there, but I got him out.  I loaded and updated the room, which fixed the bug but also deleted the boxes.  I checked the void, and they weren't in there either.  So I replaced the items as it wasn't Silverwolf's fault about the room or me cleaning the boxes by loading the room.  Any questions or concerns, see me.  This is an inv of the box:  ->> Look /obj/discon#2423A magic box, only the right person can open it.The name silverwolf is on a small plastic tag on top of the box.Inventory of OBJ(obj/discon#2423) <-> A magical storage box 0: OBJ(players/saber/weapons/spiritsword#1510) <-> Sword of the Spirits  < wc 18,18 > 1: OBJ(players/mythos/prac/bag#616) <-> Bottomless Bag 2: OBJ(players/saber/armor/age#474) <-> Armor of the Ages  < ac 4, armor >That's all.
