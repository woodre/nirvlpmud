Thu Jun 29 01:42:34 2000--Action: Myra Reason: This is gonna be a long one...Myra has been around for ages...she's always had her bard harp and she's always added to the atmosphere of the mud.  She has never had any intent of joining another guild.  She lost her harp awhile back when some measures had to be taken to protect us from Worm.  I gave her the harp back.  She is after all a bard, and it seemed thematic.

Tue Jul 11 21:17:31 2000--Action: /plaeyrs/kazer/realm/themist/OBJ/amulet.c Reason: Fixed the ::reset(arg)...in regards to the bugs we were having a week or so ago.  Didn't fix that armor.
Wed Jul 12 01:02:40 2000--Action: Auctioneer Reason: There is a cattle prod cheat to allow attacking in nofight areas, until that is fixed i've beefed up my auctioneer even more that previously.  Will set him back to reasonable levels when this is resolved.
Wed Jul 12 21:56:54 2000--Action: Sybelle Reason: Dested her star, she had a constant stream of bickering going on for like 20 minutes straight.  They are easy to get, so I fgured it was no big deal.  It ceased the huge pointless arguments flying about.  Mission accomplished.
Thu Jul 13 02:14:51 2000--Action: ExtraLevel Reason: Set Jareels extra level to +20 so she could advance to +21 again, she was trying in vain to duplicate exactly what happened. (Her hotel fubared and she lost her elemental sword, unholy fist mace and death mace)  she has mailed Feldegast on it, and I will mail him as well to vouch.  Jareel wouldn't lie about that, and she did earn the item.

Tue Jul 25 16:07:53 2000--Action: Healpack Reason: Added a \n to a write, and changed the query weight to work in multiples of 1, not 5.  If it is to reflext the weight of the heals, it should be a multiple of 1, not 5
Tue Jul 25 17:14:07 2000--Action: Boots.c Reason: added ::reset(); to my boots to fix that problem with do_special.
Wed Jul 26 21:06:04 2000--Action: Auction Reason: Fixed the auction so it -really- stops wizards from bidding.  *Grrr* thanks Pain...heh I think :)

Thu Jul 27 18:48:43 2000--Action: Armadillo Reason: I healed him while fixing him from a bug in Eurales levitate command, he was stuck in a room where two levitate objects had not dested properly.
