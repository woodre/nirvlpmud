Humble (players/gowron/room/moes):
Monster Moe and I were engaged in normal combat. I left the room and the entire area to go to Snow's Ice Cube for heals during the middle of battle, before I had slain Moe. I came back into the room that Moe was in and we were no longer combatting, most monsters I have encountered look out for you, if you will, so that they can attack you when you have initiated a confrontation with them, Moe however did not, so I typed "kill moe" to resume our earlier battle, he was healed some but when combat resumed I was taking no damage, Moe was just sitting there. I left the room thinking it was odd then went back in to see what was going on. When I went back in the room Moe initiated the combat again and normal fighting resumed. I am not sure exactly what the glitch is, perhaps it is when I left the entire area of Springfield that causes this, for when I just move west then come back in combat resumes as normal, as I said. Just letting you know as it could be used as a cheat. Thank you for your time

The Infamous Moe Bug!!!! I know some of you haven't believed me or weren't able to 'recreate' it. Again I will explain and I found away to prove it. You enter Springfield, go to Moe's Tavern and type 'kill moe' starting combat, once combat has started you leave Moe's Tavern and then you leave Springfield all together, you re-enter Springfiled once right out the gates, return to Moe's tavern, when you enter Moe's tavern you type 'kill moe' since he does not seem to attack you back sometimes, then combat starts but Moe does not strike back. This is free 60-70k of exp for cheaters and bug abusers. WHich is a good amount for people creating new characters. If you cannot recreate it with a player or what have you, ask me. I cannot be followed because it doesn't work when followed for some reason, but if you port to me you will see, that Moe does not strike back. Thank you, Please remove him from the game or look into it. Feel free to ask me anytime you are on. ~Humble

IN COLDWIND'S DESERT. REALLY IS A BUG SO PLEASE DO LOOK AT IT. 2e,se,2e. if you have a heal such as Splooges, like I use. and you want to heal, by typing 'squeeze splooge' or maybe snow's heals 'squeeze goop' then instead of healing, you go out the hidden exit of the room which is 'squeeze crack, or squeeze'. It's  really annoying to be fighting something and having to move east or west to have to heal then return to battle. But maybe the room is designed that way and I'm just a picky player who doesn't know anything. And again if you can't recreate the Moe bug please talk to me because it is NOT getting fixed and people are still using this bug to cheat with.

Sep 15 11:20:12 2003. I took Glaxgor who is in the warrior guild to the room with the LIngering Spirit, in Jaraxle's area, he is a criminal and folowed me there, we both had pk set. I killed him, but instead of getting a normal death he died but did not lose material form. he was wielding a nodachi, I was wielding scepter of zultayne and offwield a crystal ball. (had problems offwielding crystal ball and steel not dying in etest before). I was wearing chestguard of health, ted lindsay hockey skates,  bug ring, amulet of protection. The battle lasted 3 rounds and I was credited kill and points on pk tracker when he died and it came up on the obituary notice. I typed kill glaxgor again thinking he did not die and got a "yes yes" back. I typed stop and got a "you are not hunting anyone" after this I typed kill glaxgor again and again I received a "yes,yes" also, after this battle I lost my heartbeat. I went to kill a npc and casted a spell, in the same round the npc died I didn't get my spell off, but which

Sep 15. Humble. I was fighting Demonic in his guild hall, I attacked while he was idle, he was in the room that is 2w and north of 'cyber' exit from snow's realm. After two rounds I noticed I was hitting myself, this has happened before but I thought it was a freak accident. Anyways no shuratos were invloved. I was wielding two crystal balls and wearing chestguard of health, lindsay skates, bug ring, amulet of protection. I let the room for I was getting hit not only Demonic but myself as well and doing no damage to demonic. I went out to snow's area and I was still hitting myself, I almost died. my pk was set and so was his btw. I had to get a wand of calming from warp right before I died and calm a couple times. This happened once before in the wastelands and I was wielding elemental whip and gordie stick offwielded, i was  wearing bracers of speed, red lace teddy and some other things as well. I have fought Grog and Glaxgor after these bugs, seems to be just when I fight cyberninjas or Demonic

I picked all my things up and typed ready, now the screen was going by fast as Wind blows spam like windchill, but I checked inventory and I was not re-equipiping anything, so I typed "#" same deal, then I tried manually "wield whip, offwield nodachi first" then wear cloak, by this time I had run out of ice spheres and died.I was told later by Earwax who has a log of the battle that it was a bug.I have bugged on Etest before while offwielding crystal ball.He mailed some of The seniors about it and I was quite disgruntled and mailed a couple people. I apologize for the excessive swearing in the mails.

Humble (players/eurale/Keep/k16):
Fri Oct 31, 4:17:28 2003. came into the room where the imperial disirs are kept. In the keep I believe it's something like warp, keep touch stone,e,n,e,n,e,3s. that area.  there were about 8 imperial disirs. normally suppose to be 2. I realize this bug is a stinky one and I've seen it happen with bigfoot and such mobs when rooms reset and mobs overlap one another. I'm fine with it but I'm sure a lower level would cry like a baby. heh, considering 8 instead of 2 is a big difference. ANyways. thanks

Humble (players/boltar/casino/room#5844):
Oct 31. Keep bug: WHen an offwielded weapon is kept you are able to sell it, when you die it stays on your corpse, when the mud crashes it gets lost, when you dc it doesn't go into your box. Really annoying bug

Humble (room/vill_green):
Nov. 2 12:39:10. I died to a dead man in the graveyard in the wastelands and my stealth when I came back to life was 20. originally it was 30. when I die and my stealth decides to drop a single point it goes down 10 for some reason. Sorry I can't give you more to work with, but it';s been happening a lot off and on.

Matrix (room/vill_green):
Logged in this morning, and who2 would not work.  It told me none of the players I had listed were online, though my argument was simply 'who2'.  Oddly enough, when I typed 'who2 subotai' cuase I saw him on the regular who, who2 is now working fine.  Perhaps a void function needs to be added to the who2?

Humble (room/clearing):
SUn Dec 14 3:06:20 2003. Humble was fighting glavirnthal, (wizard in snow's area), after killing icingdeath, had two honed longswords wielded and offwielded. he took an incredibly long time to fight, would stay at 9/10 for 10-15 rounds, then heal back up. I don't believe he was tweaked to be a 100k mob. think it's bugged.  WOuld check it out, perhaps just a freak occurance but I write noonetheless. Thanks Humble.

Humble (room/vill_green):
OFFWIELDED KEPT WEAPON ie ({K} Hockey Stick), when dc'd, when crashed, when killed, it goes away, is looted by mizan's buggy mobs, goes to a box and is never seen again, never sticks with you like a wielded weapon does after a crash or what not. Would be really nice if someone fixed this

Sarawaks- Mizan's Sarawaks eat coins when you tickle out, teddys and offwielded weapons disappear after you are eaten and for anyone who suffers from not owning a T1 modem gets eaten before they have a chance to exit the room upon entry most of the time.

Fenfir (room/vill_road2):
Offwield/HB bug.  I was fighting in the Alumni room and also in trix's realm.  BOth places during a fight I lost my heartbeat and stopped hitting the opponent.  Unfortunately the opponent kept hitting me and since I was going up against a 50k mob I died.  DCing didn't help and I couldn't leave the room. There were no wizards on to help me.  There is a major problem with the HB and offwield I suspect and certian weapons.  I was using hockey sticks.

Fenfir (players/jaraxle/3rd/pyramid/rooms/stair_room):
Offwielded weapon, when take by lingering spirit, or when items go into a box from idling out, disappears, is dested, doesn't pop back up, even when kept.  also hb is lost often times with weapons with extra hits and the results often times is the oponnent still hitting you and you dying because you can't hit back or see your monitor and the mob blicks you.

Fenfir (players/mythos/closed/guild/task/hill/drag):
Addendum Bug Reports "OKay hopefully somehow, someway this will get looked into.  OFFWIELD for dervish is EXTREMELY buggy at times. I have lost heartbeat on many occassions, most often times I will stop hitting the monster I am fighting but the monster will continue to gangrape me.  When I am fighting anything over 50k, often times 3-4 rounds go by and I die for I can't see my mon or heal properly.  Also, sometimes the monster stops hitting and I keep hitting rendering me free exp.  also, when there is a crash, you idle out or you die to a mob, often times an offwielded weapon will just disappear, poof, which isn't very likeable.  I propose this gets looked into, or a quick route is established to give players back their lost offwielded weapons or something of this sort, since the problem will persist""

Unseen (players/mythos/aroom/forest/bridge):
While fighting benkei he was 0/10. I left the room to go get detox from the dope man and when I returned we were no longer engaged in combat, so I attacked benkei thinking it was the same one and he had repopped I guess and went from 0/10 to 9/10.

Disturbed (players/beren/Rooms/Olgyo/oroom15):
doesn't seem to be a check on if the mob is already in the room when it repops

Fran, shout shouldn't ever be blocked; I think I found a bug in mastermind, and its blocking me from trying to see if a wiz is on.

Dent (players/francesco/masterquest/machining):
Fran, I think there is a bug in mastermind.  I guessed 56789 and was told 4 were out of place.  So of 5,6,7,8,9, 4 were in the number.  I guessed 9 3 5 6 7, so at LEAST 3 should have been in the number, but it only tells me that 1 was in place and 1 was out of place.  I'll play a few more attemps, and mail you a capture of the review.

Dent (players/francesco/masterquest/machining):
If the time limit elapses in mastermind, I STILL can't chat.

Fenfir, March 2nd, 2004.  I was in the BCM ghall with Dasani, I typed learn auramancery, shadowmancery and necromancery and it took away my exp. heh.  I am going to reimburse myself, mail fred about it. all based upon how many party exp i have. i had about 800k to level, now i have 700k to level.  i'm going to give myself 800k exp because my party exp says I have earned 919298 exp.  THere was also a bug before as another character where I typed the cmd to leave BCMS and lost my life

Dent (players/mizan/etheriel/ROOMS/spoogle):
charge doesn't error check -- if I need 5 to fully charge, and try to charge 10, I lose 10 sps, even though only 5 go into the clay...could it just transfer what we need and preserve the rest of our sps?  I noticed when I was lazy and didn't want to do the math to figure out how many sps short I was and just did charge 100.

Dent (players/mizan/etheriel/ROOMS/linna):
If I have balloons in my inventory and do a sell all in a shop, I sometimes drop the balloon and it breaks apart...which is fine.  Except if that happens, I get a sensitive mind message, and the sell all stops.

Dent (players/trix/castle/town/pub):
the alcohol is listed as healing 50, but it only heals 30.  Either the heal should be fixed, or the description in this room.

Kamilico (room/post):
I was in my room, room 352.  I had previously dropped all of my things in there a couple days ago, did a restore, restored my nodachi, and dropped all my items which was a balance meter (mizan's monster guild), a firecracker, a pile of shit, a water balloon along with a stilletto dagger of wraith and posion, sohei's robes and the nodachi.  When I returned and did a restore I resotred the nodachi, the daggers, the robes, the pile of shit which I stepped in, the blockbuster firecracker, then I tried to 'store' to store my nodachi and it asked me to do a restore, so I restored and got 6 yummy cookies back.  Not sure if they even heal you but nevertheless it's an odd bug.  it's about 11:50 AM PT.  Probably has to do with Mizan's piles of shit, blockbuster firecracker, balance meter and water balloohn being stored.

Icarus (players/mythos/aroom/forest/bridge):
I was fighting Benkei, I left to go to the man who sells detox injections.  I got detoxed, which took about 20-30 seconds then came back and Benkei had gone from 2/10 to 10/10 in a matter of seconds.  Why this happens I don't know, this isn't the first time it's happened either.

Denttle (players/earwax/area/fields/room/sanctuary):
The info command on the dispenser doesn't deal with invalid entries.  You get a sensitive mind error if you type info foo.

Geek (players/snow/dervish/hall/hall):
It is my intention to show with this string that the blue crystal where the xetra spawn is a terrible buggey code. One mid level mob that can do up to 350 damage in a single round is crazy hard. I have experienced this damage, and I think it is wrong. If the xetras are there to do that much damage then they should be worth more exp or more coin. This has happened to me in the twice in the past week. I believe that someone should take a very close look at the xetra and figure out a happy medium for the players.
