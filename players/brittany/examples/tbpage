The Dream...

  Three times Randolph Carter dreamed of the marvelous city, and
three times he was snatched out of slumber.  All golden and lovely
it blazed in the sunset, with walls, temples, colonnades and
arched bridges of veined marble, silver basined fountains of
prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens, and wide
streets marching between delicate trees and blossom-laden urns and
ivory statues in gleaming rows, while on a steep slope northward
climbed tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables harbouring little
lanes of grassy cobbles.

  It was a FEVER of the gods, a fanfare of supernal trumpets and a
clash of immortal cymbals.  Its meaning must once of been supreme,
though in what cycle or incarnation had it been known, or whether
in dreams or in waking, one could not tell.

  Mystery hung about it as clouds about a fabulous unvisited
mountain.  The pain of lost things and the maddening need to place
again what once had been an awesome and momentous place.
