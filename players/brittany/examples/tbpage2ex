The Dream... (continued)


  The DREAM-Quest of Unknown Kadath..where a simple, mystifying dream
of a dazzling opulent city becomes an obsession.  Where the answer
lies in the disappearance of a MACABRE, through the words of the
forever dead:

                                GUIDE

                And while there are those, who have dared
           to seek glimpses beyond the Veil, and to accept
           HIM as guide, they would have been more prudent
           had they avoided commerce with HIM, for it is
           written how terrific is the price of a single
           glimpse.  Nor may those who pass ever return,
           for in the vastnesses transcending our world
           are shapes of darkness that seize and bind.
           The Affair that shambleth about in the night,
           the evil that defieth the Elder Sign, the Herd
           that stand watch at the secret portal each tomb
           is known to have and that thrive on that which
           groweth out of the tenants thereof..all these
           Blackness are lesser than HE WHO guardeth the
           Gateway, HE WHO will guide the rash one beyond
           all the worlds into the Abyss of unnamable
           devourers.  For He is the Great One, which the
           scribe rendereth as THE PROLONGED OF LIFE.

  This book was written so one may visualize the theme.  The world's
location is uncertain as to whether it exists now or in the remote
past.  I hope you will enjoy the area.. Happy Adventuring!
