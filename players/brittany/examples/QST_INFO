     Once you have coded in a quest that players must solve to become a member
of our wiz core, you must do the following things:

First, have a senior wizard go through the quest to make sure that it actually
works and does the things it's supposed to.  In most cases, I will be the one
to evaluate the quest and send what I believe to be it's difficulty ratings
both mental and physical along to Boltar.  When they have been added to
/obj/quest_pts.c it means your quest is ready to be put into the game.

Second, be sure that at the point that the player actually solves the quest
he/she actually gets credit for it by including the line:
	this_player()->set_quest("quest_name");

Lastly, you will need to add some lines of code to your castle in the reset(arg)
function.  These lines are:
	if(!present("quest_name",find_object("room/quest_room.c"))) {
	qob = clone_object("obj/quest_obj");
	call_other(qob,"set_name","quest_name");
	call_other(qob,"set_hint","Hint in advance.\n");
	move_object(qob,"room/quest_room");

It is your responsibility, the coder, to maintain your quest and to keep it
updated if need be.  Nothing is worse than an old quest that has not seen any
changes since the day it was coded.  If, in the senior wiz's opinion, your
quest has gotten stale and easily solved by the players, you will be asked to
either make changes in it, one of the seniors will make changes in it, or it
will be removed and replaced.

Congratuations on having contributed a piece toward deciding our new wizards.
