/players/brittany/kadath/armor:

blrobe.c - You need to set_type() on this item. A robe is usually
           either type armor or type misc.  If this doesn't
           fall under type armor not sure why it should be ac 2.
           Also, if a person sells this at a high-end shop, they
           can get as much out of it as if traded. With the
           randomness, maybe more maybe less...nothing wrong with
           that, but something to think about.
CORRECTION - set_type - armor, AC2; set_value (500+random(350),
trade (1000+random(350)

cloak.c - Same as above, you need to set_type(), most likely misc
          Here you have a difference in the value and trade value, 
          makes a little more sense. What makes this worth being
          ac 2 though? it is a bloodstained cloak, not magical, or
          special other than it might be worth something to someone
          else.
CORRECTION - set_type - misc, AC1; set_value(500+random(400),
trade (900+random(400)

crucifix.c - need to set type here also, most likely to amulet. This
             Items is also ac 2, reason? Weight 3 seems heavy for
             something this size also.
CORRECTION - set_type - amulet, AC1; set_weight(1)

lightmail.c - looks good except you might want to change the name from
              light mail to lightmail since that is what it is called in
              the short. Also need to set_type()
CORRECTION - set_type - armor, AC4; changed light mail - lightmail in name

mask.c - ac 2, not sure why. This mud has a few select ac 2 items, not to
         say you can't code any, but we need to limit items that are 
         armor to ac 4 for main armor, and ac 1 for everything else unless
         hard to get or special.  
CORRECTION - set_type - helmet, AC1, set_value (350+random(250),
trade (750+random(500)

medallion.c - Ac2 problem again, no set_type().  Also, get rid of the
              period at the end of the first line in the long, change to
              a comma and un-capitalize Which.
CORRECTION - set_type - amulet, AC1, removed comma and period, uncapped Which.

turban.c - You will need to add set_type(), do something about the ac2,  and
           add set_save_flag(1) in the reset. This item cannot save
           because of the ruby that you can twist off.

CORRECTION - set_type - helmet, AC1, added set_save_flag(1)

Overall, you have amulet, helmet, misc, and armor...a person could walk into your
area and be fitted up very very well instead of walking across the mud to find
the items they might need.  Cannot concentrate powerful items like this into one
area.

COMMENT - All of the armor in my area will require the player to fight a lot
in the area.  It will cost them a substantial amount of coins, heals, etc.
The turban will not be available until I have finished my quest room.


/players/brittany/kadath/item:


/players/brittany/kadath/npc:

anzoogs.c - Long:  add ' to your "doesnt" on line 1 and your "dont" on line 3
            add an s to appearance on line 3.  Next, he is level 18 and wc is
            supposed to be around 26 for this size of mob, although it can be
            slightly lower because of the special you have added. There is no
            reason for: gold = clone_object("obj/money");
                        gold->set_money(0);
                        move_object(gold,this_object());
            if it doesn't give money. Lose this.
            set_spell_mess1() tells the room what is to be seen, while mess2
            tells the person being hit. Also, try to make more sense out of
            set_spell_mess2().
CORRECTION - Changed doesnt - does not, dont - do not, wc - 22, rm gold code.
fixed set_spell_mess1/2

Calli.c - Get rid of the gold part again, since it sets to 0.  Also, you have
          confused the set_spell_mess1 and mess2 again, the mess1 is for everyone
          but who is attacked.  The monster_died() message you give doesn't quite
          make sense, redo it.
CORRECTION - removed monster Calli.c from area, it was an error.

carter.c - Long desc: hierglyphics needs to be hieroglyphics
           also in the long you seem to slip into past tense, wore in the 4th line
           and were and looked in the 5th.
           You need to put the set_wc and set_ac AFTER the wear and wield commands
           on him.  Otherwise his ac and wc sets to whatever the wep and armor is.
           he has no set_spell_mess2(), although the mess1 is correct.
           Also, You have the shakujo, turban, and 3200+ coins given for killing
           this guy. The wep is very nice, so I would knock the coin gain down
           to 1/4 or so. This is too much gain.
CORRECTIOM - moved wc/ac after the wear/wield, adjusted coins (2000+random(375),
Also carter will be part of the quest room.  Added /players/brittany/kadath/npcs/one.c
One has the same code as Carter with a few deletion, the shakujo and turban
will destruct after death.  Corrected hieroglyphics

ghast.c - spell_mess2() need to change stumps to stomps...change mess1() to what it
          needs to be(tells the room, not the opponent).  Get rid of the gold set
          since it sets to 0.  monster_died(): hoofs break, change to hooves break off?
          Also, the hoof trades for a great deal of coins, max for a level 19 is
          2000 coins, adjust this.  Corrected stomps.

CORRECTION - fixed set_spell_mess1/2, rm gold code, changed hoofs - hooves
adjusted coins (2000+random(750)

gugs.c - need to ditch the gold set.  Need to adjust the fang.c to fit the 
         monster.guide rules.  He is somewhat tough so some allowance can
         be in order here. Not much tho.
CORRECTION - rm gold, adjusted fang value (2500+random(900)

Kaman.c - Did you want messages for his attacks(mess1 and mess2)?
          monster_died(): The slight, maybe changed to A slight?
          In monster died you have clone_object("obj"), fix this.
CORRECTION - added mess1/2 message, changed The slight - A slight, rm clone_object

Nasht.c - no mess1 or mess2, unless you want it that way?
          monster_died() your message here says: msg...need to change this
CORRECTION - fixed mess1/2, updated monster_died msg.

nyar.c - Need to set ac and wc AFTER the wield and wearing in reset().
         mess1 needs to be towards the room, or change it to mess2.
CORRECTION - moved ac/wc after wield/wear, correct mess1/2
         
pooka.c - Need to either remove the mess1 and mess2 or do something with them, remove
          gold set since it doesn't give anything.
          With monster_died having nothing in it, you can remove it as well as the
          set_dead_object in reset.
CORRECTION - removed monster from the area..do not belong.

sages.c - Need to move the set ac and wc after the wear and wield command in reset()
          remove the gold sets, since they give 0
CORRECTION - moved ac/wc after wear/wield, removed gold, set mess1

spirit.c - Need to move the set ac and wc after the wield command in reset()
           The dagger that is found on this mob is WAY to tough for a level 5,
           MUST CHANGE.
CORRECTION - moved ac/wc after wield/wear, changed dagger to ac 15
dagger will destruct after death.

tarasque.c - Monster_died i think belongs to something else, need to change it.
             get rid of the gold set since it gives 0.  Mess1 and mess2 need to
             be fixed to tell the appropriate person/people.  Also, you seem to
             slip into past tense in the long and in load_chat. Also, mess2 uses
             the message from another mob, change it.
CORRECTION - removed monster from the area.

trader.c - Need to get rid of set_dead_object and monster_died if you aren't going
           to use them. You can also ditch message_hit since it doesn't set to 
           anything special.
CORRECTION - rm set_dead_object/monster_died, ditched mess_hit

zoogs.c - load_a_chat: change gazes to gaze
          get rid of the gold set since it gives 0
CORRECTION - load_a_chat, changed gazes to gaze, rm gold.

/players/brittany/kadath/treasure:

gold_box.c - recalculate the weight after the destruction.
CORRECTION - will not be used until quest object

rubie.c - I think this should actually be ruby, not rubie.  
CORRECTION - will not be used until quest object.  I know rubie
is spelled wrong technically, but it is the way I want it.

tail1.c - you have short(){ and set_short...need to get rid of one of these.
CORRECTION - rm short(){

/players/brittany/kadath/weapons:

boomerang.c - ""+HIW+"fissured"," skin, slicing into the bone", can be changed to
              ""+HIW+"fissured","'s skin, slicing into the bone", which 'might' 
              help.  In the spell itself, you check for if sp < 2, when the casting
              cost is 10...need to change this.  This throw spell looks like it
              is usable against a player, but having a base of 5 damage with a
              random 14 is illegal for the cost of 10 sps. This cannot pass as is,
              read the rules in doc/build/RULES on spells and costs.
CORRECTION - corrected 's in fissured, adjusted sp <2 - 10, throw spell corrected.

dagger.c - Wc 25, this is very very powerful...cannot have it this high.
CORRECTION - Changed dagger to 15

scimiter.c - Actual spelling is scimitar.  There is no reason to set the
             message_hit since it uses normal messages.
CORRECTION - scimiter is spelled both ways in the dictionary, I chose this one
because there are already scimitars in the game

scimiter1.c - is this used in the game? wc 30, i am assuming its not.
CORRECTION - rm from area

shakujo.c - Might want to look at the messages for your hits, some need
            changed...Also, you have a return 4 AFTER the {}'s which means
            it always returns 4...need to put it inside the {}
CORRECTION - What is the problem with the messages for hits?
moved 4 inside {}

tbow.c - spelled poisonous, go through and change it in the wep.  Also,
         a random 10 will give a return of 0-9...so you can never get
         the special which asks if it is a 10. Need to change that also.
CORRECTION - corrected poisonous throughout, changed random to 9
 
/players/brittany/kadath:  [ROOMS]

6altars.c -  The last line of the long, need to change it to make more sense: either
             change hand to hands or do to does.  There is no reason for out(str) when
			 you have it setup as a setting in your exits.  A concept you need to learn
			 is that random() numbers start at 0. So if you do a random(10) your results
			 will be 0-9...no 10.  In your gaze function you have a random(6) but no
			 0, instead you have it range from 1-6, need to fix this.

CORRECTION - will be redone for a quest room in the future.
burrow.c - When cloning your mobs you search for monster2 and monster3, but the name of
           the mob is monster.  You will need to change this otherwise you will get a
		   large number of zoogs showing up after each reset.
CORRECTION - corrected check for zoog, rm redundant room exits.

burrow1.c - You need to make the same changes as above with the monster2 and monster3
            check.  Also, You can ditch the add_actions for back and tunnel since you have
			them setup in dest_dir.
CORRECTION - corrected check to zoog, rm redundant exits.

burrow1a.c - Same changes as burrow1.c
CORRECTION - same corrections as above.

cave1.c - Long desc:  Need to change run to runs in the 2nd line, also look to looks in
          the 4th line.
CORRECTION - changed run - runs, look - looks

enroom2.c - Might want to change the medallion's check for present to something a little
            more uncommon than if(present("medallion"....could be replaced for another
			rather easily.
CORRECTION - changed medallion - britmedal

enroom3.c - There is a much easier way to do the check without cloning the dummy, ask
            Snow or another wiz for further help on doing this.  Also, the clues are
			very vague here in finding the pentagram and twisting it. If you want it
			to be this vague that is fine, otherwise....
CORRECTION - redone w/o cloning the dummy.  The pentagram portion will be
part of my quest.

enroom4.c - Need to have an item desc for: plains, roofs
CORRECTION - made desc for plains, roofs.

enrooms.c - 4th line in long desc: change begin to begins
CORRECTION - correct begin - begins

kadath2.c - Need an item desc for lanes.
CORRECTION - made desc for lanes

koth.c - Long desc: Maybe change 'was vaster than' to 'is more vast than'? try and keep
         things in present tense also.
CORRECTION - change to is more vast than, updated past tense.

kothup.c - long desc: seem to seems. Once again you use the dummy, there is an easier
           way, consult an experienced wizard.

CORRECTION - changed seem - seems, updated w/o cloning dummy.

monstary.c - should be monastery. Also, you are using past tense to describe something
             they are looking at in your long.
CORRECTION - changed monstary - monastery, updated past tense.

room3.c - No reason for the functions up() and down() since you have exits in reset,
          ditch them.
CORRECTION - rm redundant exits.

room4.c - Same as room3.c
CORRECTION - rm redundant exits.

room5.c - Ditch the up() and east() functions since they have no real purpose.
CORRECTION - rm redundant exits.

tdown.c - Need to ditch the exit functions you have setup here like in room4.c etc.
CORRECTION - rm redundant exits.

tdown1.c - same as tdown.c and in the long you need to change called to calls.
CORRECTION - changed called to calls, rm redundant exits.

tdown2.c - ditch south() and north() functions since they are redundant.
CORRECTIONS - rm redundant exits.

temple.c - Long desc: change seem to seems.
CORRECTIONS - changed seem - seems

templedoor.c - You have no check for the mob here! with it setup this way you will get
               a new mob no matter what each reset. Also, ditch your redundant exits
CORRECTION - added check for monster, rm redundant exits.

tunnel.c - can't look at 'face' add to item descs.
CORRECTION - added desc for face.

villa.c - Long desc: 1st line change seem to seems and breathe to breath.
CORRECTIONS - changed seem - seems, breathe - breath

villa2.c - redo the 1st line in the long. Can't look at tavern, river, or path...add these
CORRECTIONS - redid the room description.

villashop and villabar.c - Might want to play with the longs more, i understand that this
                           is taken directly from the shop and pub code, but it needs more
						   atmosphere.
CORRECTION - added more atmosphere to the bar and shop.
			   
ADD-ONs - added two new rooms, since I decided to redo the 6altars for a quest object.
The files are /players/brittany/lair.c and lair1.c

Sorry for the extra work, but the 6altars wasnt working for me.
