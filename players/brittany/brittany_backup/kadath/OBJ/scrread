  The lost box..

   When Randolph Carter went on his journey through the realms
of dream, this scroll was the only thing found after he vanished.

   Randolph Carter was determined to be the first to reach the
city of unknown Kadath.  He boldly befriended the most horrendous
of all inhabitants on the way.  The former surface dwellers known 
as the Gug's told Carter all that he needed to know to reach the
elusive city.  The Gug's knew all of the secrets of overcoming
traps set by the crawling chaos.  Sharing this information was an
unspeakable sin and the Gug's were condemned to live underground.

   Randolph Carter did reach his goal, but did not find what he
expected.  The crawling chaos had changed the traps and imprisoned
Carter when he reached the city.  He was imprisoned in a sacred
place, where time does not move in consonance with any known time
system.

   In order to free him from this place, the box must be found.
The box can only be opened by turning the dial to the exact
date and time that Carter was imprisoned. (291000Z022020)
