The Ambrosiatic Hall:

A small area consiting of 10 rooms:


                11
                 |
                10
                 |
              7--9--8
              |     |
              5     6
              |     |
              3--2--4
                 |  <------enter gate
                 1

Rooms:

Room 1 is the entrance to the hall. It is guarded by Azelane. 
She does not appear at first, but only after trying to enter
hall proper. Azelane bars the way, warning that to try to enter
is to die. If the player continues to attempt to enter, she
attacks. There are roots here that can be used to combat the
special that Azelane does during combat, if a player is so
inclined to look. The portal leads back to /players/anshar/chamber.c

Room 2 is of little interest, just the beginning of the hall.

Rooms 3 and 4 are essentially identical. Simple rooms until the
player attempts to go north. Then, four suits of magically
animated armour leap to attack.

Rooms 5 and 6 are essentially identical. Continuation of the hall.

Rooms 7 and 8 are essentially identical: Guard rooms containing
three guards which will attack of the player attempts to enter
room 9.

Room 9 contains Tanu and Coran, which prevent the player from
continuing to the north while they are present.

Room 10 is the back of the hall. It contains Terran who keeps the
from leaving while he is present. This room is also Non Teleport

Room 11 is a treasure room containing 20-25K coins

Items:

chain1 found on the defenders is an ac3, wt3 body armor, valued at
500 coins.

halberd, also found on the defenders is a wc17, wt4 weapon with a
20% chance of a return of 2.

deathmaster found on Terran is a wc18 wt4 weapon.  Assuming that
the alignment of the wielder is evil there is a 33% chance of a 
special.

root is a root picked from hall1. The root has no value, and is used
only to make Azelane's special not go off.

My castle will be updated so that it leads to /players/anshar/chamber.c
(see /players/anshar/castle2.c) and /players/anshar/forest/room/path1.c
will be updated to lead back to this same room so that all future expansions
will be from here (see /players/anshar/forest/room/path1_2.c)
