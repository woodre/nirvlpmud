a blackjack dealer. heres a basic rundown of how it works.

there are five seats at the table. players may 'sit' to
fill a seat. once they sit there, they have that seat until
they either 'getup' or are kicked off due to idleness. the player
in the first slot can 'start' to start the game moving. anyone in
the room (even non-players) may 'kickoff' the person in the first seat
if they are being idle. this gives a call_out of 20. if the game isnt
started within that time, the player forfits their seat.

the game starts. each player antes 100 chips and is dealt 2 cards
face down. the dealer is delt cards in the same fashion. (a player
reaching a total of 21 here automatically wins 1000 chips and is
removed from the rest of the game.) once those cards are dealt, 
the betting round starts. starting with position 1 and going around
the table, bets are placed. again, a call_out for each player to 
boot_me() is made for 20 seconds. dont make your bet in that time,
forfit your seat.

once all bets are placed, the option of 'hit' or 'stand' are given
to each player around the table, starting with position 1 again.
and again, the boot_me() call is made. the player in position 1 may
hit until he decides to stand or until he goes over 21. after his turn,
the next player goes. after all players have either busted or stood, the
dealer reveals his hole card and deals himself cards. he must hit on 16 and
below, must stay on 17 and above.

after the dealer has his cards, scores are shown. anyone who has a higher total
than the dealer w/o busting (or anyone who didnt bust when the dealer did) wins
double their bet.

after this, the variables are reset, and the player in position 1 is free to start
a new game.

questions, yell at plasma.
