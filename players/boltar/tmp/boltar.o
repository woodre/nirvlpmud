I've been thinking about working with the otherSeniors to develop a kind of hierarchy, so we can divide ourlabour and get things done easier, because I'd rather do alllib work and my own tinkering than have to deal with areaapprovals too :)Well, let me know.  Wocket is gone, and Felde is rarely hereand so is unable to approve areas and so forth in a timely manner.With Maledicta on the fritz sometimes, I don't know.. I don't seehow it could hurt.  He's already gotten Mythos' blessing andeveryone else here is pretty much all for it, I'm sure.Think about it, I'll promote him myself if you forget about it,just let me know what you want to do.**vertebraker**Subj: xDate: May 18 00:06mail boltarZeusAnother consideration for another slot as Senior is Zeus.Zeus has coded a brilliant guild, the Fallen, which is ahigh-level guild with very unique spells.  He is very adeptat coding here, second to only a few people.  He doesn'thave quite my level of expertise, but he's practically there.He's also VERY patient with his time, and likes to help others.He makes very, very few mistakes.  He is precise, and the perfectguy to get "another opinion" from.  He helped me with a lot oflib tweaking and ideas, as well as coming up with a fullsystem of damage types and so forth.  He is constantly workingon his own code, as well as suggesting fixes for elsewherein the game.  He is someone who I'd be proud to shareadministrative duties with on this mud, and I'm sure ifyou know anything about his track record since he's been a wiz,you'd also know it to be impeccable.  He's never been a problem,and he's a great guy to have around to help with not onlythe incoming wizards, but with the novice LPC coders here[and we have a lot of them].Again, let me know what you think.Thanks B.v**sephiroth**Subj: ProblemDate: May 22 10:58for some unknown cause I can no longer log in from my home computer.

I think the "Why"     is obvious.  Hands-down, Maledicta is the most proficient coder    and administrator we have here.  L200 puts him on the level with    Snow and Eurale.  With a couple new seniors on the horizon,    I just decided it was a good idea.  I know you aren't around    as much as maybe you'd like to be, so I just wanted to do it    for you ahead of time.  I hope this isn't in error.    In my opinion, Feldegast could maybe promoted to a higher level,    as he has also contributed quite a bit to the wiz-community,    although he's hardly been here at all, and is practically inactive.    But as far as Wocket goes, I can't see I've seen much of    an administrator from him.  He basically abandoned his apprentices    and left us to pick up the tab.  We've been talking as    wizards about branching out into different groups, like one wizard    being in charge of monster approval, one wizard in charge of room    approval, etc., and with the new wizards coming in, I think Maledicta    definitely deserves the bump-up.  * I also promoted Daranath to L100.  I noticed you promoted Zeus to    level 100.  Well, Daranath coded a lot of the Necromancer guild    that is now in the guild.  He's coded HUGE areas which are very,    very popular amongst the players.  He's also donated a great many    good ideas and interesting code to the game, as well as assisting    with our area approvals [because he's such a great area coder]    and helping out with our newbie wizards.  For example, while I took    my vacation, he helped out quite a few of my apprentice wizards    with their code and assisted them in helping with the rules.  He's    a very polite, impartial wizard and great guy who I think will    make a great administrator, and will be a big help in our future    plans for the MUD.I know I've sent you various mails about these guys in the past, andI just went ahead and did it since I know you've been busy.  HopeI didn't step on any toes, and hopefully you're doing alright.							tom**star**Subj: pregnancy stuff...*8)Date: Jun  3 21:10I was thinkin to make it say You feel the sudden urge to see a man abouta horse...but I dunno how many people are around that aren't from the US,,and I'm not sure if that idiom applies all over...doubt it...giggleSo...prolly the best way I can think of to make it funny, especially thefirst time someone gets it after it's in, is for the pregnant girl to see..You suddenly need to pee...really, really bad.Or somethin of the sort...*8)  And I think it's one that ought to be keptprivate from the rest of the room...kinda embarrassing if everyone on thegreen knew...*grin*  It ought to happen from the 7th month on...that'swhen the baby's gettin bigger and squashin your bladder...well, not yours,but you know what I mean...*8)Star**derf**Subj: character deletionDate: Jun  6 15:09I was wondering if it would be possible to restore this character to his former greatness.

The pathis: /players/reflex/realms/nirvtownThe room files are:church.cvill_green.cvill_track.chump.cThey are all connected to each other, if you goto thechurch, you can go south to the green, and east orwest to the bridge or village track.  Items in the main descriptions all have individualdescriptions, the search command is standard, andthe smell and listen commands both work(standards inmy room obj).  The descriptions are more in depth,and the 'obvious exits' have been removed in favorof describing the exits in the main description(thisalso makes up for the fact that many 'castle' stylerealms do not get their exits listed properly in obvious exits, makes things a bit more uniform sincethey are listed in the descript instead).I think it is still reminiscent of the original town,but with a bit more flavor and looking much moremodern.Let me know what you think...-Reflex**jake**Subj: DerianDate: Jun 24 16:16At least some kinda news would be nice**scathe**Subj: Hello.Date: Jun 24 23:49I'm going to disconnect the cable Internet service I have (too crappy for themoney they extort), so I will not be around for a while.I have notified Fakir about my absence, and he will keep an eye on myarea in case any fixes/changes need to be done.Scathe**jake**Subj: ThxDate: Jun 25 06:50Thanks, i appreciate the time you took to do this...**jake**Subj: DerianDate: Jun 25 06:54Only problem is i cant remember the password for him.. :(**vertebraker**Subj: WowCc: (To: maledicta) zeus,boltar,fakirDate: Jun 25 09:09I quit for good.

Thanks for your time**vertebraker** Re:   LoginCc: (To: unseen) boltarDate: Jul 11 12:42I fixed Yorick, the problem arose in him having an aliaswith a backslash [\] at the end of the definition.For whatever reason, our driver seems to puke when afile is restored with an array containing a stringthat has a backslash at the end of it.You can put a backslash before, or IN the string,just not at the end of the string.e.g. You can do: "alias ab tell vertebraker no\no"            or     "alias ab tell vertebraker \nono"       but NOT     "alias ab tell vertebraker nono\"It's very, very strange, and it'd require a driver fix,because it's a problem in restore_object() itself.So to circumvent that, I made it so players are manuallyblocked from being able to set their aliases to havea backslash at the end of it, and posted a note on the LPCboard for other wizards.I have a feeling this bug was probably fixed in later years,but since we're running this archaic one, stuff like thisjust happens :)				verte**vertebraker**Subj: %Date: Jul 11 16:02I added in the "%" to double as "history".Anything else you would like to see added to the newquicktyper stuff?**vertebraker**Subj: %%Date: Jul 11 19:41Let me know if the "%%" cmd works, as well as"%<num>".

I've personally sold an Element of Air to krillgeta and seen Shadowman with it when krillgeta has logged off. Sort of ridiculious cause I never saw it in the shop, either of them.

I don't quite understand though, because initially I set out sending him a mail with a cheat I had thought of in hopes he could figure something out to prevent it, cause he's the bug man. Then he mails me telling me how wizards tear ppl who use the cheat apart, he went into such detail and wrote the mail in such a way that I felt he was pointing a finger at me. I jumped to conclusions and wrote something I knew would piss him off in regards to the monk profession. You've read the mails though so you know. Now I am barred from his areas with one character, and with another he is threatening to remove me from his guild.

What the hell man, he said he hopes I leave the mud for good and told me not to rejoin his guild with any characters, what the heck did I do wrong again here??? I apologized for the insult and let him barr me from his area cause he has the right to, but now he is removing my alt from hid guild, making up a story about harassment and I wanted to let this shit drop long ago.     A very confused player of the already small existing playerbaseYorick**maledicta**Subj: Yorick/UnseenDate: Aug  3 19:45Everything has been worked out with this player, so no needto worry about it.

First of all, weallowed a player to run a test character.This is not the common practice, however, it allows us toget the higher level powers checked out during the betaphase of a guild.  We tried this during the bards betaphase, and it worked out well, allowing us to find threemajor bugs in the rank 9 category...something that wouldnot have been found right away since it took weeks for aplayer to reach that mark.The next thing is, players make better testers because wizardsaren't the best players:)Anyway, we allowed a player to use a test character forthe bloodfist, and 3 of your seniors thought it would befine...however, Fakir didn't.  Thats about it.  We aren'toutlaws, just ppl trying to get a guild tested:)  Bardtestwas removed from testing less than a week later, and Iimagine with the complexity of the bloodfist, probablya bit more time was needed.

We solved the problem however, and everyone now knows we dont give players a wiz test char to play or test guilds with. (This is mainly an issue of the title of the test char in this case.)

I watchedit happen with a snoop tool that Mizan gave me(logged the action with wlog) and it appearedto me to be a trigger.  I could not prove itconclusively so I let them off with a warningand told them not to abuse the invite commandagain.  Both, of course, claim that they willbe appealing this and my 'harrassment' toBoltar and Eurale, hence their presence in this mail where I would never normaly botherthem with this trivial crap.Vartanian, for the record, is Scathe's playercharactor.  Flood is a second charactor ofCerberus, who was just jailed for triggerstwo days ago.

Specifically, themost recently added /doc/build/RULES/heals/healing_items document.  Itis SO specific that it might as well tell us exactly what to code.People are getting so bogged down in rules and numbers, that they loose the reason most of us are here - FUN.  Part of the inherent beauty of having different wizards with different backgrounds is so that items can remain fresh.  Diversity breeds a much more varied mud than everyone sitting around with the same darn opinion.I believe what frustrates non-senior wizards the most is that we arenever included in discussion of any importance, i.e. possible rule changes like the above.  These changes just drop in out of the blue, just because a senior or seniors decided it's needed.  I don't truthfully believe this to be fair to the wizship as a collective whole.  People are like lemmings...even if we aren't allowed a true vote in matters, it'd at the least be nice to the forum to voice opinions BEFORE decisions are made.I know it is the role of senior wizard to administer and overseer a lot of trivial issues.  The problem I now see with the senior wizard pool is stagnation.  I see perhaps 2 or 3 seniors on a regular basis.  While I know that they may be logging in invisible - NO one leads or administers effectively without being seen.  The only seniors I see ona pretty regular basis are Daranath, Eurale, and perhaps Beck.  The rest are hardly around from the viewpoint of non-senior wizards.  Thispresents several problems.First, with a lack or readily available seniors, lower level wizardssuffer.  Face it - most wizards come to the table quite ill-prepared to negotiate code with any effectiveness.  With the inability to see most examples (being relegated only to open dirs), the lack of senior visibility hampers their development.  From this, comes a slow-down offresh, new areas in-fluxing onto the mud.Second, once low or mid-level wizards complete new areas, the approval process creeps along because only a couple of seniors are actively involved in this process.  And face it - the bulk of new areas come from recently wiz'd wizards.  They tend to be more activeas wizards than seniors.  And, while I don't mind helping people out, and I think I have a pretty good grasp of the mud, it's rules, and coding - there's no wayfor me to help out with administering or approvals at the moment.  I think you need to take a hard look around and grab yourself some mid-level wizards and elevate them to seniorship.  There are quite a few people who are deserving of and qualified for this either through their code knowledge, their activity and coding, or simply their age here on Nirvana.  Adding some new seniors could help to propagate moreareas, fresh ideas, and speed up approvals.  It might also help to**forbin**Subj: Senior Stuff - 2Cc: forbinDate: Sep 10 12:25Boltar,Sorry that truncated on me...here the rest:areas, fresh ideas, and speed up approvals. It might also help toinitiate new ideas and changes for the better.If get angry over the fact that seniors believe that since they aresenior - no one else's opinions and views are relevant. Frankly, forsomeone to tell me to find a new mud is downright rude. All I wantto do is improve the mud and have a voice in this place. I don't wantto make it 'what I want' - just better for all players. I care enough about it to be on a lot - and will continue to be here a lot. By having several areas open, and working on two guilds at the moment, Iam trying to create more fun for those few players that grace us withtheir presence. The senior wizpool needs to be considerate of lower wizard's ideas and actively solicit their opinions whenever rules are about to added and/or changed so that no one feels left out or disenfranchised as I think many now do. I just felt like bringing this stuff up and letting you know my opinion, since this is the only way I know of to get it heard around here. I think it's time for something to be done, i.e. some new seniors added to take the place of those that have recently departedor show up a few infrequent times a month or year. There are plenty of wizards who are here all the time and are working towards betterment. Why not give those people a chance perhaps.Thanks for listening,Forbin**eurale**Subj: maledicta's special wepsCc: euraleDate: Sep 11 10:21As you know, Maledicta coded 'special weapons' for people who turned in bugs.  I amin no way casting doubt on anyone who allegedly turned in bugs but there is no fileor record concerning these.  When I contacted him about it, he told me that theplayers themselves kept track of their bugs turned in and the only one he reallytrusted was Stone.  That having been said, I would like you to take a look at aweapon he coded for Tyr.  I do not know Tyr as a player but he wrote to me and askedme to modify his wep to give him less cost for a knight spell, where he is currentlya guild member.  I will admit that I am not the best coder but this weapon appears tohave a great many advantages over other 'good' weapons found across the mud.  It isway too light, can't break, almost assures that Tyr will have hps when fighting,returns a bonus to weaspon class when with returns it is already at maxed.  I ama bit uncomfortable that this was kept in Mal's closed directory so I would like youto be the judge.  The path is:  /players/maledicta/closed/broadsword_wep.cI will be waiting for you to get back to me unless you want to deal directly with Tyryourself.

I don't believe you're given anything in life unlessyou express what it is you want clearly and openly.I know that I have only been a wizard here for just over a year, and I don't pretend to have a huge repository of knowledge of every aspect of the mudlib, but I do have a generous understanding of doc/build/rules/ and the workings of the mud.  I understand the concepts of balance (drawbacks, storability, etc.) as applied here on Nirvana - even if I do not always agree with them.I think that my strengths as a senior would be my willingness to help other wizards, my willingness to do approvals and handle quality control, my desire to address current issues quickly, and the amount of time I spend on Nirvana.I am always helpful when others ask for code advice or help, and am continually trying to watch out for the lower wizards.  It seems sometimes that wizards are approved, then left to their own devices to learn.  Most people who wiz, while they may have a great desire to create interesting places and things on Nirvana, are ill-prepared to handle coding.  I would be available to help those that were sort of left to fend for themselves by their sponsoring wizards (and we have quite a few of them).I have recently helped Daranath along with several area approvals (looking through areas and making notes/suggestions for him to check on), and hopefully he can attest that I an thorough, fair, and address all the legal, functional, and aesthetic facets of the code in question.  Also, I hope he can say that I am quick work on said approvals and do all that I can to expedite their approval &/or correction. Since I still play the game with regularity, I often notice where changes, additional ids, code tweaking, etc. might be useful in the game for the greater player populace.  It would be nice to assist the implementation of those changesonce either needed or when they would affect the mud in a positive manner.As a senior, I would also like to more actively involve the other lower wizardsas often as possible with any decisions which impact game play, rules, etc.  I think that by allowing the multitude of wizards' opinions to be heard, a more sound conclusion can be reached on any such issues.And while I don't pretend to say I will be here all the time, I do log in quite regularly - often spending at least several hours on the mud most nights.  I thinkthey my willingness to be around is the most beneficial trait that I can offer.Right now I feel that the current senior make-up is very one-sided in their views.

I thinkthe move of seniors to L90 was appropriate to say the least.It is time for a new leadership structure, and I thinkReflex would be an excellent choice.  From his playing daysin 94, to his wizship since 97 - he has seen a lot and willbe able to effectively lead.  I even suppose that wizardsmight have a refreshed outlook here on Nirvana.  Hopefullyhe will be able to re-energize people that have left and/orwere contemplating leaving.Just thought I'd drop a note with my vote of confidence.Forbin**scathe**Subj: LevelsDate: Sep 13 18:39Since it has been over 8 months since my demotion and I have not done anythingwrong, may I have my level 40 back?Thanks,Scathe**sandman**Subj: outlineCc: **Date: Sep 13 22:53ok, a few diff ideas, I'll out line them seperately.1. Mud wide events - These would be basically mob run events that would occurin the main mud back bone. I like the example of a giant invasion.I would start leaving news letters, kinda like nirvana news that would hintat things to come. Example - Reports are filtering in of giant activity in the plains. Then a day later it might have a story about the giants suspected in killinga citizen, ect. Then on a night with high player activity i'd let out the eventobject. This object would handle cloning all mobs, and eliminating them after aset time (that way the event does not get to an annoying point) In the giant exampleyou'd have a bunch of giants swarm over the town. I would make the mobs not attack low lvs and also prob have safe zones of the church and the post and the adv guild.I think these events could get pretty creative, and even be a way to pub and introduce new areas. A wizard could code and get approved an event that would getpeople interested in the area. I think it is a good way to kinda bridge areas together by having a semi story based theme which leaves us open for the free style code you perfer on here.Another idea I'd like to try is revisiting the "team area" once again.I've been thinking alot about how to make the concept work. I'd like to be ableto gather together a team of wizards (totally voluntary) and give them all accessto a common directory where they can work together on coding an area. These commonareas would be aimed at being the best of the best...and in the future would serveas good examples to new or future wizards. The team concept would allow me to gather wizards who are excellent coders and pair them with some who are more verbal and creative so that a superior product is hopefully produced. I'd like todirectly supervise the first trial of this if you approve because I think that ateam atmosphere like that has the potential to be more motivating than solo work.These are the two I'm most interested in. I have a lot more but I want to stay focused on one or two main things at a time so I can actually make progress on themif you give the goahead. if you give the goahead. Let me know what you thinkRich**reflex**Subj: My planDate: Sep 14 08:55/players/reflex/closed/NirplanIt was way too long to put into a mail.

What is frustrating is that wizards are not only building, maintaining and policingthe mud, but we are also doing almost all the financing of it as well.  Weneed to create some sort of incentive to shift that burdon to the players,but in a optional manner that does not force people to purchase if they donot want to.  I figure if we could get $30/year from our hardcore players wewould be doing just fine.  Even if we did not get enough players purchasingthis to pay all our bills, it would still be better than what we have now,which is virtually no contributions and players who contribute feeling likethey get nothing above and beyond players who do nothing for the MUD.To solve this I propose that we lease out castles to the players.  We couldmake most of the functions completely player manageable and simply have wizinvolvement for the placement of the castles.  The Paladins used to have thisfor their GC's, although without all the features listed below.  The cost wouldbe $30/year and the player would have one month's slack before losing hiscastle if he did not pay right away.  If even ten hardcore players bought intoit it would pay our bills....1) 7 basic rooms that can be described by the player using a built in command.They will be attached in a layout determined by the player at the castle'screation.  2) 3 built in rooms that cannot be changed(although they can be described) include the following: A shop tied into the main shop in Nirvana, a Armoryincluding someone who can sharpen weapons, and a equipment storage room.3) Defense options would include either an automatic mystic shield to preventall uninvited entry, or guards for PK players who wish to defend their castleactively.4) The ability to invite a player at any time from anywhere for a small SPong as the player is not in a no TP zone.5) More features to come, I assume some wizzes will have suggestions.  Perhapsa bank or some options that can be purchased with coins in-game.  It shouldgive the player a neat base, but not unbalance gameplay or PK.  More thananything this should be a status symbol for the top contributer's to the MUD.Feedback Appreciated-Reflex**jareel**Subj: My .02 on what I think would work, it all may not be possible based on my choices.Date: Sep 16 22:07I actually play a lot here and I still see stuff from more of a players view so,the choices I have thought may work may differ from most.God: Boltar (Gimme choice)Play Development: Sandman (Seems to have the right Ideas and wants to make mud thrive)Technical: Vertebraker (Needs to be a code slave and no whining done to him)Sub-God/Super Senior: Daranath (Wants to see the mud live maybe a little soft spoken for job)Sub-God/Super Senior: Reflex (Wants to see mud live maybe to outspoken for job)---This position is a lightning rod that will take a lot of shit from people.---Reflex could be a better choice due to this.Guild Lead: Forbin or Maledicta (Both have displayed guild prowness) Both should     Be part of the guild team if Mal comes back.Area Lead: Daranath or Jaraxle(Both have displayed a want to enhance the game and           Daranath has been the most activly frindly senior to new wizards)Wiz Development: Jaraxle,Beck,Feldegast,Maledicta,Verte,Forbin(Have been the most helpfull to me)Player Affairs: Eurale,Puppy (I would suggest me but heh)I left some big name wizards out of this list and that is not an accident, if thegame is going to move forward the wizards in place should have one common themein mind.

I feel like I've been helpingthe smaller wizards for a very long time now, beinga sort of liaison between the newbie wizards andtheir respective senior.  I have a good grasp ofthe lib, and a good understanding of the ruleswe currently have documented.    I consider and feel that I am not the type to put down, or demean any of the smaller wizards whenthey ask me for help (which has often been the casetowards me with some of our past Seniors). Whichthey do quite often.  When approached with aproblem, or code that I am not familiar with I havebeen really good at sifting through code, examplesand my own ideas on solving some unique problems.I've been here for quite some time, and although rather frustrated many a time I plan on being herefor yet quite a time longer.  (The frustrations seem to be getting taken care of while this isbeing written)    Aside from what I want for myself, I thought Iwould note on some persons I've been thinking tofill the sub-god possition:  For quite a while I've delt with many "Senior" and other high rankingwizards.  While dealing with personalities, and differences I feel Reflex has been very opinionatedyet objective to my ideas as well, withought beingrude, condesending, or downright an ass.  (Which is a good thing in my opinion).  Daranath as well hastreated my, and my code with the same due respect.    I feel that we all play and code here because wewant, and enjoy it.  People who are not open mindedand do not know how to relate to people (even theones they do not like on a personal level) willeventually cause some kind of conflict (as we havenow) Many a times have I hated to be here due to thefact that some "senior" has made me feel inferior. Daranath, has never done such.  Reflex - even thoughwe really do not get a long at all, I respect becausehe does not let those feelings get in the way with thegrowth of the mud in itself.**sweater**Subj: squikCc: SweaterDate: Sep 18 16:32If it's not too much trouble, could you erase Squik's file?

If you truly need to test charactors are allowed.  The code is not ina closed or protected directory and can be fullyaccessed.I created that security system with Vertebraker'spermission because it is a role players guild,and allowing it to become a wiz chat line wasnot a good idea.  However as I have repeatedlytold seniors, if they need to look at it, itsfully accessable, and they can create a testcharactor to see how something works out.  I would honestly rather keep wizards off the channels however, and even I stay incognito asplayers start deffering to wizzes when they arepresent rather than to the Guild Commanders Iset up and empowered to handle virtually allplayer issues.If this must change perhaps we can find anagreeable middle ground.

Simplyhanding it to your test charactor and adjusting their.o file will get past any of your concerns.If anyone needs some assistance doing so I can showthem how.  I simply do not want wizards hanging outon the channel for any reason unless there is a majorbug.  I think thats reasonable as I went to greatlengths to make the players run the guild.  A wiz isfar less likely to hang out with their test char thanthey are with their wiz char.If you read the help system its even set up so thatguild wizards have roles and lore within the guildto keep themselves from being any more than part ofthe story.

There is a storybehind this, and it is not what it appears to be on thesurface.  About a month ago I used the 1994 version ofNirvana that I had in my possession to set up adevelopment copy of the MUD, with the intention of working with wizards who had left Nirvana, such as Maledicta and Balowski, to create cool new features forthe game and test them there before they were importedto the regular game.  There was never any intention ofcompeting with Nirvana, and had we tried we would havebeen a pale imitation of the real thing.  However,despite keeping our project very secret, with only a fewhand-picked wizards and testers, somehow Boltar foundout about it before we were ready to show him what wewere doing. During the resulting argument Boltar madesome comments about how he 'knew more than any of usthought he did' and 'could see things that we wouldn'tsuspect'.  He then quickly told me not to mention thisto other players and wizards.  -Part 1-------------------------------------------------**reflex**Subj: My ResignationCc: (To: reflex) babette,baby,babydoll,backlash,backwards,badcompany,bal,balec,ballsack,baloo,balowski,balrog,balthazar,bambi,bambua,bannock,barbie,bardman,bardock,bardox,bardtest,baskin,bastard,bastet,batistuta,bbbbreeti,bbrz,bear,beargundy,beat,beatrix,beaver,because,beck,becka,becktest,beer,beerslut,beez,beleraphon,benca,beppbeppie,beppie,beren,berlinetta,bestic,bethany,betty,bf,bfist,bigevil,bigman,billybj,binge,bismarck,bistow,black,blackheart,blacknight,blackrose,blackstar,blade,blake,blarney,blasphemy,blast,blaze,blazzer,bleech,blitz,blitzkrieg,blkbear,blob,bloodangle,bloodfist,bloodhound,bloodninja,bluedevil,bluntman,bob,bobby,bojingles,boltar,bone,bonnie,boodle,borealis,borith,botai,botch,brache,brad,bradl,braer,brainless,braker,brandi,braxxus,brayden,breanna,breathless,bree,breeti,breezy,brennan,bri,brightblade,brimstone,brittany,brngbckapu,brocley,broli,broliswife,brolli,bronwen,bryan,budah,buffy,bulgran,bullseye,bum,busta,byron,Date: Oct 19 03:39-Part 2-------------------------------------------------This argument got myself and some of the coders on theproject very curious about what he meant.  There hadonly been a single mention of the development MUD onNirvana, and it had been mentioned without any seniorsbeing logged in, using a command that had no history orlogging, right after a reboot, and when Boltar had beenidle for over 200 mins before the reboot.  There is noway that he should have had that information, at leastby the tools available in the MUD...We started examining the customized driver and some ofthe hidden elements of the lib that we had access tocurtesy of the 1994 copy, and some other more recentcopies of files that we had acquired through othersources.  What we found is that Boltar has customizedthe game to allow him to literally log and record everysingle action by every single player, at all times.Not only that, but he is actively watching everyone, its what he does with his time here.  I tested this onmultiple occasions without him realizing it, doing actions that would get him to respond in the game evenwhen he had supposedly been idle for hours, or evennot logged in at times.  I tested it as more than justReflex, to be certain that he was watching everyone.So far as I can tell he has the system set up to watchall conversations, public and private.  He also hashacked the password system, all the passwords that youuse on Nirvana are NOT secret from him, he can see them at will.-Part 2-------------------------------------------------**reflex**Subj: My ResignationCc: (To: reflex) babette,baby,babydoll,backlash,backwards,badcompany,bal,balec,ballsack,baloo,balowski,balrog,balthazar,bambi,bambua,bannock,barbie,bardman,bardock,bardox,bardtest,baskin,bastard,bastet,batistuta,bbbbreeti,bbrz,bear,beargundy,beat,beatrix,beaver,because,beck,becka,becktest,beer,beerslut,beez,beleraphon,benca,beppbeppie,beppie,beren,berlinetta,bestic,bethany,betty,bf,bfist,bigevil,bigman,billybj,binge,bismarck,bistow,black,blackheart,blacknight,blackrose,blackstar,blade,blake,blarney,blasphemy,blast,blaze,blazzer,bleech,blitz,blitzkrieg,blkbear,blob,bloodangle,bloodfist,bloodhound,bloodninja,bluedevil,bluntman,bob,bobby,bojingles,boltar,bone,bonnie,boodle,borealis,borith,botai,botch,brache,brad,bradl,braer,brainless,braker,brandi,braxxus,brayden,breanna,breathless,bree,breeti,breezy,brennan,bri,brightblade,brimstone,brittany,brngbckapu,brocley,broli,broliswife,brolli,bronwen,bryan,budah,buffy,bulgran,bullseye,bum,busta,byron,Date: Oct 19 03:40-Part 3-------------------------------------------------Some will say "I haven't done anything that I care ifit is seen by someone else", and that is fine if thatis how you truly feel.  However I know that at timesI have passed private information on to other peoplehere.  It may have been stupid of me, but generallyI assumed that if I had done nothing wrong I was notbeing watched, and when there are no wizards logged in that the chances of being snooped are pretty small.However with this new information I now know that being watched has little to do with right or wrong, but that instead I am just a rat in a maze for one man'spersonal amusement, anything I do and say is seen byanother no matter what, and used for whatever purposeshe sees fit.  I know for a fact that he has my home address and telephone number, as well as my real name,despite me never granting him permission to have thatinformation.  Conversations about my personal life havebeen said on Nirvana, also now known by Boltar withoutme ever telling him.  Fortunatly I did not use my Nirvana password in other places, but I know many otherplayers here do not have the experience to take thatprecaution themselves.  Probably my biggest problem with this is the fact thatnone of us were warned in any way about this.  Most didnot even realize that it was a possibility.  Many of usdid know that we could be 'snooped' or logged on a individual basis, but assumed that this would only be done if a person has a problem with a bug, or is mis-behaving.  Public places in real life are required bymost states to post a notice that you are being observedand recorded before they can put cameras or microphoneson the premises.  Nirvana may not exist in real life, however the help and rules files do not even make asingle mention of the snoop ability, much less thatevery conversation you have is being logged for the personal enjoyment of the administrator.  There is alsonothing here to protect the younger players who aresaying and doing things without regard for privacy, inmost cases because they simply do not have any idea that what they say can(and is) logged by others.-Part 3-------------------------------------------------**reflex**Subj: My ResignationCc: (To: reflex) babette,baby,babydoll,backlash,backwards,badcompany,bal,balec,ballsack,baloo,balowski,balrog,balthazar,bambi,bambua,bannock,barbie,bardman,bardock,bardox,bardtest,baskin,bastard,bastet,batistuta,bbbbreeti,bbrz,bear,beargundy,beat,beatrix,beaver,because,beck,becka,becktest,beer,beerslut,beez,beleraphon,benca,beppbeppie,beppie,beren,berlinetta,bestic,bethany,betty,bf,bfist,bigevil,bigman,billybj,binge,bismarck,bistow,black,blackheart,blacknight,blackrose,blackstar,blade,blake,blarney,blasphemy,blast,blaze,blazzer,bleech,blitz,blitzkrieg,blkbear,blob,bloodangle,bloodfist,bloodhound,bloodninja,bluedevil,bluntman,bob,bobby,bojingles,boltar,bone,bonnie,boodle,borealis,borith,botai,botch,brache,brad,bradl,braer,brainless,braker,brandi,braxxus,brayden,breanna,breathless,bree,breeti,breezy,brennan,bri,brightblade,brimstone,brittany,brngbckapu,brocley,broli,broliswife,brolli,bronwen,bryan,budah,buffy,bulgran,bullseye,bum,busta,byron,Date: Oct 19 03:41-Part 4-------------------------------------------------On a final note I will point out that several currentand former players and wizards have been complicit inthis logging.  Most of them knew Boltar in college andfind the entire situation to be a big joke.  Certainplayers login simply to 'stir the pot' so that Boltarcan watch the results secretly.  They either behave inpublic or private in ways that will make things the mostlurid they can be for his amusement.  I am not going toname names here, but I am sure that just by watching howcertain players and wizards behave most of you canfigure out who knows and who does not.  To me this isa terrible thing, playing with people like they are justtoys for one man and his friends' amusement.  Draw yourown conclusions on this, I already know what I think.I hope that all of this makes my decision to close myguild and related realms down understandable to you.  Iwill be going inactive and I will not be back, ever.  Ifanyone has questions, or would like to stay in touch, feel free to email me, my address is: reflex_croft@yahoo.comFinally I can only say this: Boltar, Brent, you haveseverely dissapointed me and betrayed my trust for eightyears without me being aware of it.  I can't believe Isent you money and equipment to help maintain this placewhen it only exists to give you the private thrill of avoyeur.  I hope you get help for your problem, becauseat this point I believe it is an obsession.-Reflex/David Fleetwoodreflex_croft@yahoo.com-Part 4-------------------------------------------------**roy**Subj: ImportantDate: Oct 19 10:15I know you've heard a lot from this crap but heed my words. I highly suggest you don't try and sugar coat this at all, just come out with it, you can start over, there is hope for the mud. Administration of a mud sets examples for the coder, if one saw that you had all this information at your grasp and abused it, I'm sure you have on occassion as all of us who has had the power have with our muds, but it's not that people are watching that concerns me at all. It's the taking of information by your staff, them using it to harass players, I've been harassed as a player entirely too much and without good reason, there are some completely unporfessional people on your staff and I suggest you enforce a no tolerance rule for any behavior such as them leaking any info, people's alts, secrets of the game to others that shouldn't be known about such as wc and ac, all of that nonsense, because that is the sole reason this mud hasn't taken off, because you've had dirty wings, little maledictas and jaraxle's who harasspeople and abuse they're powers in lewd displays of immaturity when the slightest thing hurts them, they grow egos as wizards. wizards who have players and abuse the files is fine, so long as they don't share info with others and don't harass people. I don't have much more to say, I'm sure you will post something at green about the reflex incident.          A player of 8 yearsn**sylvan**Subj: mudDate: Oct 19 13:22I want to give my support to you boltar Ceres and I both enjoy everything that is here and we aren't leavinYou have done much for us and we want to thank you for each and every line of code truly we do.
