All that is needed is all or part of anIP or hostname. Any matches will be blocked from loging in. this will avoid the damaging of player files.-Bp**boltar** Re:   panop.comCc: mythos,arrina,pain,snowDate: Jun 19 13:47type authcheck**wocket**Subj: vampiresDate: Apr 26 21:26  if(num < speed) {    tell_object(environment(),      BOLD+"You strike "+      capitalize(environment()->query_attack()->query_name())+      " again with lightning quickness.\n"+NORM);    /* added line to reduce damage in pk */    if(environment()->query_attack()->is_player()) damage = damage/4;    (environment()->query_attack())->hit_player(damage/vdiv);    return; }If you could please add that line to the code as it permits vampires to go over the damage cap, it would be appreciated.  -wocket**Subj: new heal fileDate: Aug 27 04:33Hi Eurale,I did a few minor changes to the newheal.c template and copied it as newheal2.c to your folder..in /open/eurale  ..
