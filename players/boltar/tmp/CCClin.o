I cut it short or grew it long or styled it different ways or dyed it different colors.  I had control over it and it helped me define who I was.  These days I'm not as inclined to play with my hair since I like how it looks short.  However I have continued to play with my facial hair in much the same way.  From long sideburns to a full beard to a light or full goatee to a hideous mustache, clit tickler, or immense tuft of chin hair, I have changed it as I wanted to.  When I started working at Sharebuilder I had a goatee and I kept it for at least 6 months; that was the longest period of static facial hair for me since I first grew facial hair. 	To be asked by the most wonderful person to shave or have a long beard is something new for me.  People have had preferences before, but they've never compelled me one way or another. I typically made my choices completely independently of anyone else.  Right now it's hard for me to feel like I haven't lost part of my identity.  I know I'll get used to it; this is just why I fear changing others.  It's easy enough to say that little things don't matter, but I don't want you to have to remind me to shave and then eventually, years later, I get upset about it.  "It's my face I can do what I want with it!" "Fine then I won't kiss you!" "Fine!"  **zeus**Subj: this is a love letterDate: Jun  6 22:18This is a love letter ... This is a love letter ... This is a love letter ... From me to you.  I know you can't hear Spencer Moody singing that with his drunken wail at the final Murder City Devils show, but I will play it for you.  I realized today that never before in my life had I truly felt love.  Of course, I had called my feelings love in the past, but only out of ignorance.  Never did I experience such a logical sense of reckless abandon until I met you; never had I known that only one thing mattered: that I am with you.  Cart before the horse?  Perhaps you said it best when you said you're on the train.  I just hope I am too.  How clich is it to think that I finally understand what all those poets struggled to write about; what all those painters strove to convey with a brush; what millions of men have died for?  How could all of this possibly be real?  I can only hope that it is.  My biggest fear is that you might realize that you made a mistake and that I'm not quite as good as you thought I was.  Maybe you won't realize it right away, maybe it won't be for many years, but that thought scares me. We are fallible creatures, after all.  But this fear does me no good.  I can't live my life in fear.  Every day I spend with you is made better.  I may not have faith in religion, but I choose to have faith in this.  There is no reason to be cautious.  I know just as others know God is real that this is the right choice.  This is my religion.  **boltar**Subj: blahCc: dustyroseDate: Jun  8 15:15 I sense you are angry with me. I'm not raining on your parade here. As you know, I quite like such pictures, and don't feel there is anything wrong with it at all. I find it remarkable you are actually going to do it and am confident that they will come out well. I think you'd feel good seeing something like that of yourself. I don't want to stop you, not in the least. I'd like to take them myself if I could....   What I want is for you not to be hurt. To be protected. Because I know you would not be happy to find your pictures on some internet site. And unless you've lied to me, such photos will have value. That's why you have to own them.  I know you don't like hearing this stuff from me, but if I didn't do it I'd feel bad is something went wrong.  and if I don't say anything, my chance of seeing them would go up ;)  Why do I always do things like this that aren't in my best interest? Making you mad and reducing the chance of seeing the pictures :)  **"
