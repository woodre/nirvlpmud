It's been a long run folks, a very long run. Most muds do not even last 
a tiny fraction of what this one has. I thank everyone that has contributed
over the years for all their efforts and it saddens me that I feel I must
do what I am about to. 

Nirvana is slowly dying now. People have moved on, there isn't enough to
replace them. People are leaving out of frustration of dealing with the 
crap day in and out and so am I. Problem is, I cannot just leave. It is 
for this reason I will be shutting the mud off when the current payment
term to mudservices ends. I will not be renewing the hosting. I have 
personally paid for the last few months, there are no donated funds 
left in the kitty so all your contributions went to the mud's operational
expenses. I feel it's better to just turn off the mud than to let it 
go to the point where I am just looking at myself as the only login. It's
time for me to move on.

The last couple years, maybe more, nirvana has become more and more stressful 
for me, I tried to detactment and that allowed things to continue, but 
it eventually resulted in problems. I cannot please all the people all the
time and people have decided that if they are not 100% backed my me they
will just leave. 
I can't do it anymore, I just can't. 

Goodbye all.. It was fun.
