Hey dearheart,
     I just wanted to let you know that I'm going inactive again because my connection is going to be gone for a while, I'm not sure how long.  We'll chat about it some time when I get back.  Everything's fine in my life and please don't worry.  I hope you're still doing well.
*hugs*
Luvs,
Cass
