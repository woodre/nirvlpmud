I don't know how best to write this, but it's going to come out bad no matter
how, but must be done. 

You said to mail you if I were to decide to remove the ring on nirvana due
to your absence. Since you've made it clear yesterday you don't want to be on 
nirvana anymore so I see no point in clinging to it. There hasn't been 
any for a long time. I know now your absence, at least since october 
is not due to you being too busy (you do have time to play and be logged 
into muds and haven't lost interest in playing muds), you simply don't 
want to be around or play nirvana for whatever reason, be it other 
people or maybe me. All I know is that you have moved on or at least away.

So with sadness, I have to reach the obvious conclusion as to a course of 
action. And it is to move onward rather to keep clinging to an idea that
has already been clung to for far too long, that you'd come back. 
Just wish I had been told this earlier, rather than strung along and 
misled until I found out on my own.
