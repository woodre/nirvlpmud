messages "The thorns in the side(Unseen, Jul 11):**The thorns in the side of a mud are players who do not understand the concepts of roleplay and character seperation. Also I noticed here there are a lot of 'evil' characters that aren't evil, they're just dicks, mere assholes. Nusainces and young punks more than an arch villian you should make an evil character to be, not some petty thug, when people decide to no longer uphold themselves to have social decency and manners like they would in public or amongst friends and are completely disrespectful with negative attitudes effects the Mud. Surely if you just look at this simple text online game the same way you would if you were to 'put yourself' in you're character's shoes in a RPG video game, but here's the catch, you make your own idea up of who and what you want your character to be, and who he/she is. Just had to let off some steam**Re: The thorns in the side(Kaleia, Jul 28):**I couldn't agree more with you Unseen.  I see an evil characteras more of an 'anti-social' type.  Not someone who runs aroundtripping people and giggling or name calling.  That's not evil, just annoying.But as you said, we all create our own characters and theirpersonalities so if we choose to be annoying, then I guessthat's just how it is.  I guess it would be the differencebetween Dr. Evil and Mini-me (Dr. Evil is simply annoying while Mini-meis truly evil ;)Just a thought.**Unseen(Bulgran, Aug  2):**Unseen ain't go' any reason ter ask fer character separationon this game. 'E asked me who me wizard was the other day,an' accused me of avin' one.  Ter da abyss with that dog!  Ya ain' got no think'n boy, so stop yer tryin!               - Bulgran the Dwarf**Thorns and such(Stone, Aug  2):**I would agree that evil characters (there are exceptions) here are lackingin terms of depth, and this is partly fueled by a serious lack of characterseparation.  Good characters have a slightly easier time of it since, on a baselevel, it doesn't take all that much creativity to role-play "good."  Youhelp others out, give to charity, party with newbies, etc.  I think a lot ofpeople here have an impression of evil simply being the negation of good,that is, you don't help people, you steal kills, and you try to trick newbiesso that you can pk them.  Putting aside that this really hurts gettingnew people in the game (who here remembers when we had 30-40 ppl on at a time?), this is a pretty bland and counter-productive view of evil.  Both good andevil should have long-term goals and short-term goals.  I see a lot ofshort-term and not too much long-term.Think broadly, plan things out and STAY IN CHARACTER (!)...There have been some serious lapses in character separation in the last few months and morethan a few people have taken notice.  You cannot "win" this game,but you can have a good time playing it.  Strive for that.Stone**Wizzes and Players(Stone, Sep 13):**If I can deftly sidestep the confrontation between Roy and Nietzsche, I thought I'd comment on the broader issue at hand.  Wizzes, clearly, play an important role in Nirvana.  They fix bugs, higher levels deal with security, create new realms for players to explore and, one hopes, enrich the game.  Wiz behaviour I do have a problem with can generally be described as the arbitrary application of new rules.  Nietzsche is quite right when he says players are the lifeblood of this place.  Players make this place fun and interesting.  Players are what validate your latest code creation.  So why has there been an effort in the last few months (and, in some ways, years) to make all players the same?Without a decent skill system in player.c, players here are overly-reliant on items to accomplish goals and separate themselves from the pack.  I accepted a long time ago that implementing a broad skill system would never happen, but policies concerning items are, for lack of a better word, irrational.  For one, the save cap on weapons and armor is artificial.  Check the contents of players' hotels and lockers.  Everyone has the same items because they all know which ones are at the cap.  Some wizzes have reacted to this buy "nerfing" popular items (amazingly, most often items they didn't code, and then they code a 'replacement' in their own area).  This is a short-sighted, band aid approach to the problem.  The problem is not the power of the items (the arbitrary cap also means there are no-save items out there that are weaker than some saveable items).  The problem is that players are being punished for making rational decisions. Any player here, it's safe to say, want to play well.  In some cases, this leads to cheating, which is unfortunate as it can directly hurt other players but, more often and less directly, it enforces the belief of wizzes that they need to spend a great deal of time monitoring players and coding lukewarm items.  If players stopped cheating, there would be less intrusion by wizzes (and, I would hope, more creative output).  But, it's safe to say, the majority of players out there don't cheat.  In fact, I would bet it's the vast majortity.  But they DO want to play to the best of their abilities.  Which makes total senseit's no wonder their lockers and hotels all have the same items, they're the best items to get and save.  And since the cap is static, why bother getting other items?-Continued-**Wizzes and Players (pt. 2)(Stone, Sep 13):**I often complain about rote killing--that is, players who kill the same things every time they log on and never explore new areas.  I can't imagine how, after a week of that, Nirvana holds any interest for people.  But part of me can understand it.  I have 490 hps, a decent amount of power geared towards killing mobs, and a decent knowledge of Nirvana, but I still kill Rock almost every time I log in for his Iron Bracers.  Every time.  I'm 50+ days old, think about how many times I've killed Rock and it gets a little silly.  I can kill him without wielding a weapon, so it's not too exciting for me, but the current save policy pretty much mandates I kill him (or an equivalent mob) every time I play.  Does that make sense?Players need to be inspired to play and explore, not punished for discovering an interesting and *gasp* powerful item.  Nirvana has become a much more rigid, controlled game in the last 2-3 years and our playerbase has shrunk over the same period.  It is NOT losing players to EverQuest and MMORPGs, as some claim.  There are plenty of text-based MUDs out there with 60+ players logged on any given evening.  I have had former wizzes complain to me about the "anti-player bias" here, and I can't say they're wrong.  Players should be punished for cheating.  Players should NOT be punished for being smart and coming up with imaginative uses for their powers and items.  This is what separates good players from mid-range players.  Smart, aggressive play should be rewarded with items that others can't get.  Right now there is one place on Nirvana (Elemental Test) that does this.  One.My suggestion might be seen as slightly radical: let everything save.  If you've earned the finely-honed longsword, more power to you.  It takes a lot of work to get it and you should be proud.  Someone suggested (and I agree) that to encourage continual play, have items degrade over time, forcing players to either get replacements or find newer, better items.  Some top end items would be immune to this effect (again, I am thinking of things like elemental gear, honed longsword, any custom item--VERY top end stuff.  Nodachi is nice, but not that nice) since having them corrode would defeat the purpose and discourage players taking risks (Why bother to get elemental sword if it's just going to go away?).  Then wizzes could code items they want to, as opposed to items that fit within the number ranges established years ago, and mobs appropriate to guard them.Also on this issue, but much more briefly, I think players should be able to save worn and wielded items to their person.  If there is a problem with this and space, make it so you can save 1 item per 25 xlevels (or some way of narrowing the field).  In an item-heavy environment like Nirvana, it is crazy to have players risk being totally wiped out by crashes, etc.  It either encourages rote play (I need to get all my items...again) or discourages play altogether (All my items gone?!  Again!? Screw it, I'm playing somewhere else).Stone**(Amendment)(Stone, Sep 13):**See, I post and a few minutes later people are giving me ideas I love and never thought of.  Speaks to the need for an edit function  :)New "ideal" format:1.  Everything saves2.  You can only wear/wield items you get yourself.This would eliminate players begging for equipment and would encourage active play at all levels in all castles.  Mid-level castles would actually get used, newbies would fight newbie mobs with the weapons they were intended to use.  Add my ealier idea of saving items to the person and re-equipping from scratch is less of an issue.  Plus, players could then proudly display items they've earned, not items handed to them.  I think it would add a lot to the game and would do a LOT to reduce rote killing.  Yes, level progression might slow down at the lower levels, but it would give these levels meaning, something they have lacked for years.  Our current system makes it almost impossible for players to have any sense of long-term accomplishment, this would make _everything_ long-term accomplishment, which would be fantastic.Stone**Agree with Stone(Caravelle, Sep 13):**I have been playing here for a long long time now, and also have noticed the meaning in levels mean basically nothing anymore. The 2 years I played, people were considered a GOD if they were even +5. Why, you may ask? Because people had to explore, and since noone was a MEGA GOD like now, good equip was few and far between.A good system would in fact be the didn't get can't use. I have no idea how the coding of that would work though and how tough it would be to do a overhaul of the current system. It is to easy right now for a new level 1 to get a free sword from someone and turn into a level 10 within the hour. I have seen it...and done it. When I first started I remember spending HOURS killing babies in trix. I can't even begin to count how many I killed. And with the current mobs in excess of 200k a kill at times, It is still easy to level a person fast in a party that way. (even with the current shares they can use) What's the answer, I don't really know. But I do think something needs to be done somewhere. As Stone noted, the players are slowly diminishing as other muds are still going strong. Maybe if Nirvana becomes the creator of a new system like the all save if you get it, we may get new players when they hear about it. I don't know of any mud that currently has that, while being as large as it is here. I often find myself bored and as some of you know, I take LONG breaks cause of it. I would love to have something new like this to keep my interest and keep me playing.Caravelle**Stone(Yorick, Sep 15):**Your a smart guy Stone, gotta hand it to you, but do remember, some mudders rely on rote killing, it has become a playig style of some of the younger players who aren't quite capable of comprehending the whole game yet, I started mudding at an early age and not everything clicked when i was younger. I like your 'ideal' format and would be all for it, but also making this place strictly RP would rule too. But I fear this mud has seen it's days....**re: Stone(Pain, Sep 20):**I must say that I agree with the majority of what Stone and everyoneelse has stated.  These are ideas that many people have thought onand strived to achieve over the years.  I hope that with the neworganization of Wizards and the growing concern and support fromplayers like Stone, Caravelle, Yorick and all the others who haveposted on this board we can all move forward and focus oncreated a mud geared towards long term accomplishment.When I say long term accomplishment I don't mean merely getting +100 ormaxing your guild rank. I mean those things and making yourself anexample to your fellow players, leaving your mark on this place. Ipromise to work with all my fellow Wizards to create new and interesting ways to achieve that greatness.I ask this of all of you, post your ideas on these boards or in emailsto Sandman and I, give us feedback on how things are going, and direction for where you'd like things to go. A mud is for the players.-=P=-**bleh(Legion, Sep 26):** Nirvana in simplified terms. A wizard steps forward and leads. His areas are decent.His guilds add a good touch to this mud. Then all the bored wizards begin to plot and plan. They have no realpurpose on this mud. The only time they chose to code isto create an item of thier liking to help them as a player.These wizards chase off the few good players and wizardsleft. Now instead of improving the mud they decide letshack it. Lets degrade every piece of fucking equipment thatthe average player uses. This weapon does to much damage.This weapon heals to much. The dumbest fucking thing I haveever heard from a wizards mouth in a long time is, 'the snakeshould be recoded, its way overpowered'. This fucker is way outof touch with this mud. This wizard shouldnt even be in chargeof his own cock, let alone a mud. This person is in charge ofa mud full of people. People that prolly dont even respect him. Then you have the other sect of wizards. The ones that upgradethe fuck out of thier guilds. No real enforcement so lets sneakin some more fucking armor class. Fear this shit. A guild getsstronger then the Mobs get stronger. Fuck that. It never ends.Why not show some originality. If a guild has a unique power,dont steal the fucking thing for yer guild. Code based on atheme. Fuck power. Theme is what its all about. Players arewhat its all about. Some where along the way this GAME became a prison.Some of us has tried to shape the mud as wizards or asplayers. It seems wizards are not allowed to associatewith players because others are jelous. An involvedplayer is said to have knowledge that he shouldnt.Of course wizards dont want players to have this knowledge,because these wizards also play. Knowledge is power.Wizards horde information to improve thier play, which inturn makes the game more fun for them. I guess they getsome kind of joy watching the regular players fumblearound with useless equipment that they can not identify.Which sword is better the PHB or the SOS. Of course thewizards dont want you to know. But they know and usethe appropriate weapon for the appropriate situation.  Lets say some wizard/player jails yer ass for Bullshitreasons. Then while yer jailed he changes yer guild soyou cant post on the guild boards. Then lets you stay injail because he doesnt want people to think he made amistake for jailing you in the first place. Then to top itoff he posts saying he might kick you and yer kind out ofthe guild. Then imagine that you have been in this guildsince 94 and have taken an active role with in it.   What kinda sad/loser fuck does that. The kind thatfears you. The kind that wants you to leave the mud forsome unknown reasons. Maybe you killed his charactersto many times. Shrug. Who knows. Maybe, some day you fuckers will relax and have some fun.In some far off future knowing the trident of war is wc 18 wont be a big fucking deal. Then maybe this place will be fun.Til then, go ahead and fuck all the eq up.

They are attracted to our power-free,pure fun atmosphere, and our dedication to removingpolitics from the creator ranks.  There is no powergrab as you mentioned above on our mud.  Only threetitles.  They simply define job duties.  I personallydo not run the mud, we all do by consensus and everyone's opinion is taken seriously.  We discussissues without the acrimony and arguing that definewiz life here.  Its a breath of fresh air.Most importantly, we treat wizards and players asadults, not as children.  When I am asked about anability for a guild, or a item for a realm the answer I give is: Does it fit with the theme ofthe realm?  Can you justify it against itself?Our job is to make the game fun.  If a wizardmakes a power guild that has everyone gaining levelsat a massive rate, so be it, but he should realizethat his players will max out and move on inno time.  That wizard has failed to make theleveling experience challenging, rewarding, andmost importantly, fun.I tried to get these concepts across to youwhen I proposed the re-org in the first place.I told you that Nirvana is a software developmentproject and should be managed as one.  You ignored that advice.  That is your perogative, itis your mud.  But we all decided to go elsewherewhere things would be run a bit more to ourliking.

You want the player base here. If youand reflex didn't you would have left without all the fireworksand just started a mud honestly. Draw people on your own merits.You'd certainly have no need to fix up a bug ridden guild likethe undead and take other code of inactive wizards from this mudor use the base mudlib code I wrote.

But you don't have any whys, any explainations, any support for your statementsthat make sense with the history.

If were a screwup with a lack of ability there wouldn't have been players here. You would not have been here in 1996, because the mud would have died when I left IIT in 1996 and didn't have the time I used to for it if it hadn't long before then.You certainly wouldn't have taken my code, using it as the foundation of your mud. Why did you start with a foundation of work by a 'screw up' with a 'lack of ability'? You can claim you changed it from stem to stern, but you still choseto use it as the foundation, the starting point. Like reflex, your actions don't match your words.  > I was one of your best, and now, I will be> Elysium's best.

It was about the power plays.You needed that social challege of taking power, it's right therein your words above. Rather incompatible with reflex's descriptionof your new wonderous mud.

I found Reflex's project of trying to help> Nirvana much more appealing.It isn't about 'helping' Nirvana. It's about destroying Nirvana.You could have started a mud without the fireworks, without my code.You chose otherwise. Reflex had one thing in mind from day one, andyou were in on it. It was as transparent as anything when I heard aboutit. The goal was starting another mud with my code.  Thing is I foundout about it. People tell me things. Then you were between a rockand a hard place, the players and wizards here knew you were thieves.> I loved Nirvana, and wasn't wanting> to give up on it just yet...His promise of a better Nirvy rok'd.> Thief?

You started with my code, at leastyou finally admit it now. You know my rules regarding Nirvana code,you don't use it. PERIOD. As a starting point, and ending point,or anything in between for another mud.And I was on that mud remember?  There wasn't a 'ton' of workdone. It was identical to nirvana's 1994 copy. I actually saw thecode there after I demanded control of the project. It was forall practical purposes freshly un-tared.But you couldn't have that, me in control of it. You show what thisis about in this post in no uncertain terms, it's about you and reflexhaving POWER. Power I wouldn't let you have. That last bit I refusedto delegate. So you decided to come up with a cover story you thoughtwas offensive enough to players so they would come to you, so youcould take over.> We found out about your little trips into voyeurism and bailed> on you.  We didn't feel like ditching our work, because it was> well done, so instead we worked to remove Nirvana from it, andYour fabricated cover story to get players to think your theftwas ok. The cover story where everyone points to another personfor the proof. Mal says reflex's seen it, reflex says candy'sseen it, candy say who ever said he's said it is a liar, but reflexsaid it so it must be true. It's like the who's on first rutine ina way, but this isn't funny. Your fabricated story to steal theplayers from here. You cannot stand on your own two feet. You sirare the cripple. You base your mud on theft of code, theft of idea,deception,lies, and slander to attract players. Wow, what awonderful place it must be.It boils down to one thing, and one thing only, you couldn't starta mud on your own that players actually would go to on it's ownmerits alone. You boys needed to come here and try to destroy thismud and take from it every last bit you could.> > I am so 'weak' but you need my code.

Funny how little you did on Nirv94.I did alot. It's still showing the through the cracks. You don'tknow what I did, you can't even figure it out. That's why youneed my code, 98% of what I did wasn't commented or marked withbig flashing lights. The obvious stuff I haven't seen onlineyet. It's all those individual things both big and little that addup to alot that I have seen. All the repainting of code you've done,just redressing what the player sees. The stuff that makes the mudtick, the fixes to the shit that doesn't work out of the box, thestuff that gets changed only through the progression of play.All that work you didn't want to be bothered with. The shamelesscopying is obvious. And if I did so little, there was no point instarting with it. But you started with it anyway. Your actionsdo not make sense with your words.> > I sided with eurale and fakir. Remember?  You and felde and fakir> Once again, you sided with no one.  You just watched.  No one lead> the wizards...it all just sorta tumbled along.  Chaos is NOT fun.Your new mud is based on chaos of everything goes, remember whatreflex posted? It's about 'fun'. No silly rules of play balanceor anything like that. It's about having less controls than nirvana,or at least that's what reflex's posts say. You've supposedly takenthe next step further into chaos. That's what reflex has us to believehere, that it's like the sceen in the Holy grail,"I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we takeit in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.... But all the decision of that officer ...... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majorityin the case of purely internal affairs. ... but a two-thirds majority ..."Again, you boys just cannot get your lies together so they match.Yes, this mud is a chaotic to a degree. It has to be in order to function.But it obviously wasn't chaotic enough for reflex's tastes, and toochaotic for yours. So you get together and create a mud from stolencode together? It will be fun to see what happens when your visionsstart to collide like two trains going head on into one another.> > Now your words don't even match.

You've called me a 'screw up', you'vecalled me a 'cripple', you've said I have a 'lack of ability',you accuse me, hell you act as if it is undisputed fact, of activitiesthat a wizard should be banished from a mud for. Yet you offerme a spot? Why do you want some 'sick' (your word on oct 19 ifI am not mistaken) person who 'spins conspiracy theories', takes'trips into voyeurism' in your little domain? Certainly, if youactually believe your spew I'm unfit to be part of reflex worldeven as a player let alone a wizard or creator of any capacity.Yet, the offer... why?The question is why? The answer is your plan didn't work well enough.To steal nirvana fully, you need to either have control of me ortotally destroy me. You haven't been able to achieve either of thesethings.You also seek approval for your actions. That's why you are here, posting.You seek justification, approval of what you did, if not from me fromthe audience. In your heart you know what you did is wrong. That's whyyou are here. That's why you offer. Because your guilt needs to be putaway. Well live with your guilt, go see a therapist or something,because you are thief, a liar, and someone I should never have trusted.**board restoration.(Boltar, Nov 11):** Nurgul's message of nov 11th disappeared, so I have restored the boardfrom backup.**Flame(Jaraxle, Nov 12):**Notes on here are getting WAY too longparse em into two or three notes for thosegeeks of us who do not have 25" monitorsfor our computers.**headline Nirvana(Whisper, Nov 12):**This place is and has always been hometo me, and always will be.
