Tue Jul 14 02:09:25 2009 > Gideon** tell marek workin on a killer new idea
Tue Jul 14 02:10:01 2009 > Gideon** tell marek create a shop, it sells starter weapons, swords, staves, maces, etc etc.. all sorts
Tue Jul 14 02:10:31 2009 > Gideon** tell marek once you buy one.. you wield it, start fighting with it.. you toggle X ammount of the xp you get with it to go into the weapon
Tue Jul 14 02:11:03 2009 > Gideon** tell marek after you have enough you bring it back to the shop for your 1st upgrade, yeah but way more than BF
Tue Jul 14 02:11:25 2009 > Gideon** tell marek you can put millions of coins and xp into the weapon, kinda like BF.. but soooooo many more options
Tue Jul 14 02:11:45 2009 > Gideon** tell marek you can make it dull slower, rank 1, 2, 3 etc more and more xp/coins
Tue Jul 14 02:11:49 2009 > Gideon** tell marek add specials to it
Tue Jul 14 02:11:53 2009 > Gideon** tell marek spells
Tue Jul 14 02:12:09 2009 > Gideon** tell marek detoxes.. upgrade it to give you bonuses to stats
Tue Jul 14 02:12:31 2009 > Gideon** tell marek upgrade a poison option, level 1,2,3,4 etc stronger each level..
Tue Jul 14 02:13:03 2009 > Gideon** tell marek its not a guild.. and its all within reason, just a lot more options.. like all other weapons have specials
Tue Jul 14 02:13:11 2009 > Gideon** tell marek and any guild can get it
Tue Jul 14 02:13:31 2009 > Gideon** tell marek its just another way to spend coins/xp and you could make each one diff
Tue Jul 14 02:14:17 2009 > Gideon** tell marek so, you can get it to autoload, upgrade it to dull slow as hell or not at all, eventually start adding 1 WC at a time
Tue Jul 14 02:14:43 2009 > Gideon** tell marek tons of xp/coins again.. but over time you tweak out a super badass weapon thats customized just for your char in your guild
Tue Jul 14 02:15:13 2009 > Gideon** tell marek i just want a new reason to get xp/coins once i hit +100
Tue Jul 14 02:15:17 2009 > Gideon** snicker marek
Tue Jul 14 02:15:37 2009 > Gideon** tell marek but i need more legit ideas on types of upgrades.. and when i say spells, i mean more like.. modes of attack
Tue Jul 14 02:15:47 2009 > Gideon** tell marek ie: hit multi mobs
Tue Jul 14 02:15:57 2009 > Gideon** tell marek add to defense, like parry attacks

Tue Jul 14 02:17:55 2009 > Gideon** tell marek so, i know what ya mean by being like BF a bit.. and i'm not tryin to replace the need of a guild.. just offer up a super badass upgradable weapon to custom fit your char/guild

Sat Aug 29 20:06:37 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan i think making other guilds a bit better is a good idea.. but nerfing others to match the weakest guilds isnt a great idea
Sat Aug 29 20:07:13 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan all that happened that irritated me.. is they made it where if Shardaks spinal wields air, it starts sapping our stats
Sat Aug 29 20:07:27 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan not a huge deal.. but it just seemed like a start to the nerfing i kept hearing about
Sat Aug 29 20:07:59 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan i wrote up a big text on great ideas to make the bards better
Sat Aug 29 20:09:21 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan btw.. Star.. she's kinda gettin on my nerves. tell me if i'm wrong here, she jumped my shit about how correcting areas is her job, and she's going to do a damn good job at it.. etc etc. so i'm like fine, i'll rewrite some of mine, to get it approved.. there can be know descs starting with You have entered, You stand before, etc etc
Sat Aug 29 20:09:45 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan then.. i go into Shinshis area.. her little boy toy.. an area she approved before going visit him
Sat Aug 29 20:10:27 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan the very first room! starts with You have entered a blah blah blah.. so, that annoyed me, then i find out, that and other things were pointed out to her.. after she approved it..
Sat Aug 29 20:10:45 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan and she justified it somehow.. saying he needed to put that that way etc
Sat Aug 29 20:11:01 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan heh. thats clearly favoritism in my opinion man

Tue Sep  8 11:48:09 2009 > Gideon** wiz well have any of you EVER seen a semi-colon in an areas desc? she's requiring that i put some
Tue Sep  8 11:49:49 2009 > Gideon** devs
Tue Sep  8 11:50:43 2009 > Gideon** wiz hehe, she's even knocking the code on my rifle/uniform that ppl can grab.. how its buggy and allows ppl to grab them far too often, funny part.. Fred is the one who helped me with that
Tue Sep  8 11:51:07 2009 > Gideon** wiz heh
Tue Sep  8 11:51:27 2009 > Gideon** wiz i dunno how we ended up leaving it.. i just know i needed help gettin it where they couldnt just grab a bunch
Tue Sep  8 11:53:45 2009 > Gideon** wiz well, Star didnt ilke the fact that when i was asked by a number of ppl, why my area was still not up.. that i told them, the truth.. i was done with it a long time ago, and waited for her to look at it.. and waited, and waited.. then waited a bit more
Tue Sep  8 11:54:01 2009 > Gideon** wiz then, she looked at it.. gave me some changes, i made them.. then waited and waited
Tue Sep  8 11:54:21 2009 > Gideon** wiz so now.. she really wants me to go crazy on it.. semi-colons etc

Wed Sep  9 13:22:27 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan it did seem that way.. i'm glad that wasnt the case.. because i know star.. and i know she's done that song and dance before, with those very results

Thu Sep 10 16:37:27 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan so you know, ive been knowin she would like to be a wiz again, but it wasnt until yesterday when i was making changes on my area that i asked her a few questions and she had answers for me that helped that i thuoght it'd be a huge help to me. i explained to her the problems preventing her being a wiz, the doubts and worries etc, and she's more than willing to hear you out fully. follow any rules you set forth and i'll also help monitor her from my end.
Thu Sep 10 16:38:11 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan i think if you were willing to lay it out for her, blunt and exact, what you expect in the future, etc.. she'll follow it to the letter bro. i'll make sure of it.
Thu Sep 10 16:39:07 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan she asked if a new name, one that noone knows.. would help.. so she could avoid any conflict, follow your rules and just do her job.
Thu Sep 10 16:40:31 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan so i've told her in the end, her future is a possible wiz is up to you.. and told her when you're around she needs to approach you and talk to you about it. again, it'd mean a lot to me if you'd be willing to give her the chance.

Thu Sep 10 22:23:46 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan i'm not pissed.. im just gonna leave a few months.. things will fair well i'm sure. maybe by then things would have changed and she can get a fair chance like everyone else

Thu Sep 10 22:25:10 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan nah man, not pissed.. it woulda been a huge help to me, made my time learnin to code soooo much easier.. then ya got the 1 small shard nerf thats happened, worrying me about more.. then the shit with Star.. its just been piling up. but per your request, i've been letting it slide

Thu Sep 10 22:35:35 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan its all good, you're right.. i dont see that im missing any opportunity by leaving a few months.. i really would love her wizzing to help me become a good wizard
Thu Sep 10 22:35:41 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan yes, it meant a lot to me
Thu Sep 10 22:35:51 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan but not enough to dislike you over not agreeing
Thu Sep 10 22:36:35 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan but months? seriously? how will Data prove he wont fuck up or cheat again as a wiz? by being one and proving it man
Thu Sep 10 22:39:37 2009 > Gideon** tell mizan nog.. well, im not trying to argue. i'll be back sometime man.. check in on things. i just was fed up with shit.. like the nerfing, no she didnt tell me that.. Artos sends me a tell sayin wtf man, we've been nerfed, huge! it sucks.. then Shinshi tells me too.. then Chip is pissed, everyone is bitching. then its fixed back. then Illarion hacks air to sap my stats.. when Shards are far from the best guild.. but i suck it up. then Star out right breaks rules for Shinshi and nails my nuts to the wall.. now, I cant get her a fair chance to rewiz and help me irl to become a good wiz
