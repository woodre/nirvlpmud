Sun May 17 23:49:42 2009 > Gideon** hnog marek
Sun May 17 23:50:06 2009 > Gideon** cm hmm, cheated how exactly?
Sun May 17 23:50:44 2009 > Gideon** cm i mean sure, i turned ppl against you.. slipped you a bag.. EVERYONE brought in heals in bags.. mine just happened to be a dragon bag.. and that mattered?
Sun May 17 23:50:50 2009 > Gideon** cm even you
Sun May 17 23:51:00 2009 > Gideon** nod marek
Sun May 17 23:51:18 2009 > Gideon** reply we'll see.. but you keep the potion
Sun May 17 23:51:18 2009 > Gideon** tell marek we'll see.. but you keep the potion
Sun May 17 23:51:30 2009 > Gideon** reply i still say 'we' won it
Sun May 17 23:51:30 2009 > Gideon** tell chip i still say 'we' won it
Sun May 17 23:52:00 2009 > Gideon** cm but, the question is.. heals in a bag is heals in a bag.. how is a dragon bag any different? or anywhere near cheating?
Sun May 17 23:52:08 2009 > Gideon** cm i coulda bagged the same heals, swapped bags inside
Sun May 17 23:52:16 2009 > Gideon** cm and most my heals.. came from you ;)
Sun May 17 23:52:24 2009 > Gideon** cm so, he's WAY off
Sun May 17 23:52:48 2009 > Gideon** tell marek cause i turned on jaster and formed teams etc
Sun May 17 23:52:56 2009 > Gideon** tell marek she doesnt get pk
Sun May 17 23:53:48 2009 > Gideon** cm honestly, if there a difference in your mind from one bag type to the next? when i can swap out everything in seconds
Sun May 17 23:55:10 2009 > Gideon** cm i just think its funny that he'd say that.. but coming from someone who doesnt pk, who cares. bella said i was a cheat for being on a team
Sun May 17 23:56:10 2009 > Gideon** cm but i could have very well bought a bottomless bag, bagged all the same heals and summoned a dragon inside and swapped em all out. if anything, a dragon bag is more easily stolen
Sun May 17 23:56:32 2009 > Gideon** cm yeah, i did it only cause you said what you did earlier that day.. 3 +100 samis vs everyone etc
Sun May 17 23:56:44 2009 > Gideon** cm so i took the tables and turned em is all
Sun May 17 23:56:50 2009 > Gideon** cm as i saw it.. at least
Sun May 17 23:57:14 2009 > Gideon** cm its all good, after all that BS i wont be joining another
Sun May 17 23:57:37 2009 > Gideon** cm you shoulda taken the mages first no matter what
Sun May 17 23:58:23 2009 > Gideon** cm i just find it sad that just because i win, ppl get all shitty and point fingers, call names.. and yet, they didnt even have the balls to enter
Sun May 17 23:58:31 2009 > Gideon** cm bella, shinshi, or whoever else is talkin smack
Sun May 17 23:59:37 2009 > Gideon** wiz honestly, pk is not only being well geared or prepped, its about slipping bags, or any other trick you get away with..
Sun May 17 23:59:41 2009 > Gideon** wiz oops ;)

Mon May 18 06:32:37 2009 > Gideon** wiz i didnt see any real harm because a new spinal is better than a half dead one..

Sun May 24 18:46:31 2009 > Gideon** tell bella i just wanted to make sure there was no chance for us in the future before i was to spend anytime with anyone else
Sun May 24 18:47:09 2009 > Gideon** tell bella you've made it clear we have no future.. i wasnt mad. i hung up because i was done talkin.. and i wasnt yelling. i said tell kai i said happy bday and let you go
Sun May 24 18:48:11 2009 > Gideon** tell bella i just dont want to sit here, alone.. feling lonely, with noone to care for and noone to care for me. so rather than just give up on us, i was waiting

Sun May 24 18:49:43 2009 > Gideon** tell bella she's made that clear in the past
Sun May 24 18:50:33 2009 > Gideon** tell bella i did buy her a rose.. and asked her to come watch a movie with me tonight. but i'm not asking her to be my 'girlfriend'

Sun May 24 20:15:20 2009 > Gideon** tell bella i'd rather spend my time with you, but you dont want me anymore.. theres nothing i can do about that other than just accept it
Sun May 24 20:17:20 2009 > Gideon** tell bella well, sitting here all day alone really sucks. and she was nice to me, so i got her a rose.. i've 'talked' to her.. not really flirted. shrug. the only thing anywhere near flirting was when i told her she was pretty
Sun May 24 20:17:54 2009 > Gideon** tell bella she noticed me, for about 5 seconds i felt i wasnt totally alone. it was my way of saying thank you
Sun May 24 20:18:00 2009 > Gideon** tell bella but thats hardly 'moving on'

Sun May 24 20:20:06 2009 > Gideon** tell bella anyway, all i did was talk to her.. when we werent together. i'd say thats not as bad as the whispering and giggling with you and rob.. then you talking to him more since we broke up
Sun May 24 20:20:38 2009 > Gideon** tell bella and if i remember right, one of the times you broke up with me before, your ex kissed you, bought you a ring, etc
Sun May 24 20:20:50 2009 > Gideon** tell bella i'd say that was moving on a lot faster than i have
Sun May 24 20:21:26 2009 > Gideon**0 ip
Sun May 24 20:22:10 2009 > Gideon** tell bella seriously, you have no idea or probably even care how i felt hearing you're now talkin to rob on the phone
Sun May 24 20:24:03 2009 > Gideon** tell bella you say its only 'talking' on the phone.. but i remember a time when all we ever did was talk on the phone.. and how we were
Sun May 24 20:24:07 2009 > Gideon** sigh bella
Sun May 24 20:24:51 2009 > Gideon** tell bella i lived far away as well.. and i doubt he pinned you down and forced a kiss on you. but i know you never cared how i felt about that
Sun May 24 20:25:31 2009 > Gideon** tell bella you never cared how i felt about that, about waking up to you two on the couch, or anything else that hurt my feelings.. all you did was blow up on me if i brought it up
Sun May 24 20:26:47 2009 > Gideon** tell bella you sure are good at avoiding me when i try to give you a little kiss, but you're right.. it was 2 years ago, i'll drop it. you didnt care how i felt then and obviously never will
Sun May 24 20:27:21 2009 > Gideon** tell bella and i did NOT.. i never told ANYONE you fucked him, i said you stayed up all night in thier with him.. that i woke up at 4-5 and found you two sleeping on different sides of the same couch

Sun May 24 20:29:11 2009 > Gideon** tell bella well, someone has to care how i feel. you made it clear along time ago you didnt. everything was always my fault.. anything i did wrong was huge, you never did any wrong in your eyes.. and anything i did right was looked over like it never happened
Sun May 24 20:29:31 2009 > Gideon** tell bella but you're right, its over. i wont plead my case or feelings anymore to you.
Sun May 24 20:30:39 2009 > Gideon** tell bella well, i'm sorry we ended up like this. i really did love you. and i did fight to get you back.. then you went laughing to everyone telling them i wont stop 'begging' you to take me back

Sat May 30 00:26:39 2009 > Gideon** wlog Kyria asked me where to get a bottomless bag, I wasnt sure, I went to check at pass. I bought one, found out I was right, told her where to go, she went, I had bought the last one, they cost 5k. I told her to give me the 5k, she did, I dropped the bag I had bought, she grabbed it. Just reporting it so noone thinks I cheated. Thanks.. and Sorry if it was any trouble.

Sat May 30 00:27:13 2009 > Gideon** devs
Sat May 30 00:28:23 2009 > Gideon** wiz Btw: I was 'fetching' anything for a player, I was simply making sure I was right about where to get that bag. The only reason I went ahead and got her to give me the 5k and dropped the one I had bought when I was checking was because i'd bought the last one. She went to the pass to get one herself and found out there were no more left.
Sat May 30 00:28:41 2009 > Gideon** wiz So.. I told her to give me the 5k, and dropped the bag.. but I didnt know it'd be a prob
Sat May 30 00:28:45 2009 > Gideon** wiz so it wont happen again.

Sat May 30 00:32:40 2009 > Gideon** wiz again.. sorry, i'll be more careful with that kinda stuff in the future. she's an old player (Dustyrose) is her main.. she just asked me where she could buy an 'endless bag' heh. I figured she meant the bottomless bag.. but as Worm I always use my dragon bag.. so I wasnt really sure, only semi remembered.
