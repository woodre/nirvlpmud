messages "Long live Stone(mousebrain):**the Age of Stone has come to an end, with Justin passing himupon the top players listing.   A moment of silence, please....**Good Mudding (part 1)(boltar):**Good MuddingThere are simple rules to good play when it comes to mudding. Theyaren't anything particularly amazing or difficult to grasp. Butit seems many have forgotten them given their conduct in thelast few months. This is the reason I have written this, toremind people. Not only so they can make choices regarding their behavior but that of others and wether or not these others are the kind of people they want to follow.Now we all know the rules about fair play, regarding such thingsas not playing two characters on the same mud at the same time.Such things as not abusing bugs and the like, but I really wantto go beyond those, to the very core.The first points are regarding harrassment. It's just not to be done,plain and simple. Recently, I have personally been on receivingend of harrassment and had to banish someone for it. Some of youmay have seen it. It's bad enough players doing it to other playersbut downright stupid to do it to a mud admin. Obviously this behaviortakes the fun out of mudding.**Good Mudding (part 2)(boltar):**Another poor behavior I've seen as of late is people loggingon as guest only to create problems and harrass anyone theycan. It's another sad image of the sort of people that are around.I'd rather not get rid of guest, but the abusers are ruining thingsfor everyone.Moving on we get to slander, again this is something that certainpeople have been doing in the last few months. Not only towardsmyself but others both wizard and player alike. Like harrassment,this has no business on a game where people are trying to escapethe real world. Mudding is an escape, not a journey into a mindfieldof political fighting or gossiping little girls.While not in the same league as the above is an example of bad form.It is to recruit players for another mud, your own, one you play, orhave an interest in on a mud. There has been a rash of this latelyon Nirvana as people simply sit and idle until people come in thatare suitable for recruitment. What has been different this timeis that relies on other items covered this article rather than thesimple try mud XYZ, it's cool rutine. It's sad that people justdon't have the good sense to refrain from these behaviors.Now I'll take a somewhat different catagory, integrity. It's moreimportant for a wizard because wizards are trusted with access to codeand other important aspects of the game. It starts in not breakingbasic rules of fairness of the game and not creating cheats forfriends and it ends with refraining from taking code.**Good Mudding (part 3)(boltar):** Recently I was told that it's no big thing to steal a basic mudlibfrom an established mud, because afterall, what they are takingis based on free base sources and it's 'not that hard' to start a mud and set up a basic mudlib. Well, if it's not that hard, why not start from the free, base sources?The question comes down to integrity. Take the easy route ofcopying an existing, working mudlib and using it as a base tryingto pretend it's an original creation or to dig up free base sourcesand generate one's own. Which is a person to do? It depends on their integrity, plain and simple. If a person has it, he does the extra work to start from base sources and not use any code from another openmud. Another thing a wizard shouldn't be doing is trying to play gamesgetting groups of wizards to fight each other. Starting rumors andgenerally creating problems. This sort of political fire starter is not someone to be respected. Lastly is respect. Respect is a two way street. Lately it seemspeople think it is only one way. Not only with regards to thismud but in the real world as well. It isn't. If you want respectyou have also give it. Many have counted on my continued respectof their wishes or of them even if they showed no respect towardsme. This has occured from players and wizards alike. It is part ofthe reason mudding has lost alot of the fun it used to have for me.Before choosing where one plays, consider what the adminstrationof that mud does with regards to good muding. Think if you believethat these guidelines make good sense or they don't. Ask where you'drather spend your time, with people who will try their best to respectthese ideas or those who rutinely don't by their very actions. Afterall, how long will mudding stay fun if these guidelines aren't followed?**ignoring.(boltar):** well, I ignored notes at first, and players started quiting because they thought I didn't offer anything of substance, that considering it the workof a wack-job liar and thinking most people would was not enoug.so I debate em and kick their ass instead.*shrug* can't ever please everyone. **Idiocy(mizan):**I missed out on all of this garbage that happened with some other mudbasically committing code theft of this lib. It's probably a good thingthat i did actually. For the record, i am pretty annoyed at thisespecially at the former wizards involved. Some of you i did not get alongwith when you were players, but after you wizzed, and mellowed (so i thought)over time i have come to make my peace with you as a group.However it seems that my original hunches and gut feelings towards thoseindividuals was correct. They were nothing more than a bunch of slap-happyasshelmets that i wouldn't trust to hold a bag of cockroaches and atub of peanut butter. Witness their baiting on this board (and other mediums) as indictments totheir true personalities and shallow selves. Also witness the single-digitcurrent logins on their dumpy mud as a sign...That what goes around comes around. Enjoy.   :)-m**Vertebraker(breeti):**The Vertebraker makes me laf!**Nice mud.(oaktree):**As an old player and coder, I've been trying to find a good mud. Much like this one. Congrats y'all. You've done a fine job. It's reassuring. Cheers!**still kicking?(porkypig):**Wow, this is still around?  Awesome.  Must replace "elof.iit.edu" muscle memory with new address.  Howdy, y'all!**"
