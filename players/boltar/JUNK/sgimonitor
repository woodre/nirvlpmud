I don't know if there is a converter solution but I know the SGI 20E21 is a excellent
monitor DB15 and 13W3 connectors.   The 17E11 (I think that is its number) 17"
SGI monitor works well as well.    What I love about the 20E21 is it works on
everything does up to 1920x1600 res..   Relatively cheap used - shipping is
costly.  As to new monitors, get the model number hit website and check if 
sync on green is supported..

If people want to start sending me known working 3rd party monitors that sync on green
confirmed working on black - please post or e-mail me - I'll put up a web page with a list
at some point.
