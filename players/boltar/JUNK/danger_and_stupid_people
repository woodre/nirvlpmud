"Danger Eliminates Stupid People"

Every day some new do-gooder is trying to save us from ourselves. We have so
many laws and safety commissions to ensure our safety that it seems nearly
impossible to have an accident. The problem is that we need accidents and lots
of them!

Danger is Nature's way of eliminating stupid people. Without safety, stupid
people die.

With safety, however well intentioned it may be we are de-evolving into half
witted mutants, because, idiots, who by all rights should be dead, are spared
from their rightful early graves and are free to breed even more imbeciles.

Let's do away with safety and improve our species. Take up smoking, jaywalk,
play with blasting caps, swim after a big meal, stick something small in your
ear, choose a really dangerous activity and do it with gusto!

Future generations will thank you.
