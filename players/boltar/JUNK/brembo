Brent,
	The Brembro brake set-up is awesome.  The system is superior.  The shipment
for the brakes would be about $ 52.00.
	The 98 Cobra wheels will clear w/ no problem.  If you have any questions or
would like to order the brakes please let me know.

Thanks,
	Chris Jones

Subject:	Brembo Cobra R brakes and more...


I have a 1997 Mustang GT and wish to get
the 2000 Cobra R brembo brakes for it.

It is my understanding that '98 Cobra
17X8 rims will clear the calipers. My
measurements of them on a '98 cobra
support this.  Is it true that these
wheels will clear the width of the brembo
calipers?

I don't want to go to 9 inch wide wheels
due to the winters in chicago, so the
'98 cobra wheels would be the best choice
for me.

In addition to the brembos, I would order
the hi-performance street brake pads for
the rear and the Clutch quadrant with cable
and firewall adjuster.

The online catalog seems out of date since
the brembos list for $900 with the sloted
rotors.

What would the price and shipping be on
all three items to 60089?

Thanks

-Bp
