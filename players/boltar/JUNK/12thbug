You can extrapolate the leadup to this:

At the twelfth bug of Christmas, my tech lead said to
me
    Tell them it's a feature
    Say it's not supported
    Change the documentation
    Blame it on the hardware
    Find a way around it
    Say they need an upgrade
    Reinstall the software
    *** ASK FOR A DUMP ***
    Run with the debugger
    Try to reproduce it
    Ask them how they did it ... and
    See if they can do it again.
