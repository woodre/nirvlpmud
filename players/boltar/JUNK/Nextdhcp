There is a package for dhcp2.0b1pl6 (note that this is a beta) on peak 
for OpenStep at

ftp://ftp.next.peak.org/pub/openstep/mach/apps/utils/networks/

This is compiled for OpenStep 4.2 (Intel and m68k) only, although the 
bpf the package installs works on NS 3.3 or OpenStep 4.2 (Intel and 
m68k).

I tested this with one cablemodem provider that used dhcp and it works 
fine, but configuring the /etc/dhclient.conf script to work with your 
particular (ISP) provider can be tricky.

Tim Luoma's page has very clear, detailed instructions on setting 
Netinfo up for a static ip address in his "articles":
