I use a Baystack Instant Internet firewall/router with a V.90 modem
and hang everything off its minihub (see
http://www.nortelnetworks.com/link/baystack_ii for further details).
I used to run PPP directly on my NeXTstation, but this works much
better: it offers dynamic dialup so that my wife and kids can do their
email and browsing without worrying about connecting to the net -- and
the PPP daemon never panics since it's not running (which used to
happen occasionally with my old setup).

Note, I work for Nortel, so my recommendation may be biased. :)

The box I'm using is really intended for small business office use,
however there is a consumer version available for a lot less money.
See http://www.netgearinc.com/products/routerhome.shtml for details.

YMMV,
Christopher
