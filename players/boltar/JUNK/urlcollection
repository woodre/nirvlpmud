Here's the latest RRE pile of URLs, in full.  (Those of you
who follow TBTF will know about "hurling"
[http://www.tbtf.com/jargon-scout.html#emailurls]; Agre is
guilty of mega-hurling.) -- Will

Subject: [RRE]pointers

Another awesome batch of URL's, with thanks to the highly advanced life
forms on RRE who contributed them.  As a periodic reminder, most of the
URL's that I have circulated on RRE since 1998 are available on the Web:

  http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/urls.html

This page now includes over 1000 links, the vast majority of which are
still working and useful.  Please let me know if you find any bad ones.

Davidson Gigliotti wrote to say that my inclusion of the Early Video
Project on an earlier list of URL's caused him to make contact with no
fewer than 1000 people with an interest in the subject.  Pretty cool.
If you know of other charismatic projects whose URL's I should include,
please do let me know.
