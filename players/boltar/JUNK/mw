Men and Women
  There is a difference...

1.A man will pay $2 for a $1 item he wants.
   A woman will pay $1 for a $2 item that she doesn't want.
2.A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband.
   A man never worries about the future until he gets a wife.
3.A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife
   can spend.
   A successful woman is one who can find such a man.
4.To be happy with a man you must understand him a lot &
   love him a little.
   To be happy with a woman you must love her a lot & not try to
   understand her at all.
5.Married men live longer than single men - but married men
   are a lot more willing to die.
6.Any married man should forget his mistakes - there's no
   use in two people remembering the same thing.
7.Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed.
   Women somehow deteriorate during the night.
8.A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he
   doesn't.
   A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change & she does.
9.A woman has the last word in any argument.
   Anything a man says after that is the beginning of a new
   argument.
10.There are 2 times when a man doesn't understand a woman -
     before marriage & after marriage.
