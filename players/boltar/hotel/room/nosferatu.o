long_dsc "This entire room reminds you of a coffin.  There are cobwebs hangingfrom every corner. The tapestries are all dark red velvet, and flow asif they were alive.  Various jars of a viscous red liquid line theshelves. The lamps appear to be putting off just barely enough light foryou to see."
