long_dsc "Cool hues of powder and cerulean blue soothe your soul and calmyour psyche, further augmented by the muted Celtic music playing inthe background.  Just inside the door is a tidy whitewashed wood standwith a matched China pitcher and basin, both white trimmed in tinydark blue flowers, filled invitingly with fresh, clean water.  On the farside of the room rests a white four-poster bed covered with midnightblue satin sheets which peek out from beneath the snowy white coverlet,futher adorned with large fluffy pillows of midnight blue and coveredwith a white gauze canopy that is gathered and flows gently down eachof the four corner posts.  A plush blue couch and two matching wingbackchairs, all clustered upon a snowy white rug before a merry fireplace onthe side wall, welcome visitors to Blysse's room."
