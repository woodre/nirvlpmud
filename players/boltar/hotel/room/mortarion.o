long_dsc " This room is finely decorated.  Rich deep purple curtains hang fromthe windows, blocking all but the most faintest of light from outside.On one wall sits a massive fireplace, the flickering of its flamesends dancing shadows flitting through the room.  Near its base sitsa deep in ground stone pool.  A lazy steam floats on its surface as acascade of heat warms all who venture near, relaxing them and makingthem feel right at home.  On the other side of the room sits a massiveking sized bed.  Rich laquered and intricately carved wooden posts sitin each of the four corners, which support a rich framework above.Soft silken sheets adorn the bed and a pair of large soft pillowsat the head of the bed.  To each side sits a rack of candles who'ssoft light captures the calming nature of the room."
