long_dsc "My god...  how did such a vast, cavernous room fit into this hotel?!!?The first thing catching your eye is the waterfallto the left.  It seemsto come directly from the wall by no visible means, yet falls steadily intoa small decorative fish pond below.  On the right you see a myriad of oldpaintings depicting countless battle scenes.  It soon dawns upon you thatthese are all part of the story of the owner, and his previous exsistencein Nirvana as a proud member of the once great Undead Guild.  It even bringsa tear to your eye to think such a good thing is now gone.But really, it's the way the room opens out beyond all this, into a smallfield with scattered trees, and seemingly no end in sight which is mostunsettling.Make yourself at home!"
