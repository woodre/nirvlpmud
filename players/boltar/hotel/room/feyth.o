long_dsc "Muted Celtic music and the faint scent of lavender and sandalwoodenvelop you.  The oversized canopy bed in one corner of the roomis clad in a thick scarlet and gold comforter which coordinates perfectlywith the overstuffed wingback chairs and thick Persian rug which restinvitingly before the tidy white brick fireplace inset in the far wall.  Alarge, ornate cherry wardrobe against the wall near the bed remainstantalizingly closed, concealing some of Feyth's many secrets."
