long_dsc "Alexis's room is dim and inviting, the only light the warm flickerof candlelight and the merry dance of yellow-orange flames in thetidy fireplace on the far wall.  Two plush leather wingback chairsrest serenely on the plush rug stretched before the fireplace, balancedby the matching leather couch on the opposite side.  A gleaming cherryside table separates the seating group.  On the left wall rests an enormousdeep cherry four-poster bed, thick with burgandy and gold damaskcomforter and pillows, beside a matching wardrobe, tightly closed."
