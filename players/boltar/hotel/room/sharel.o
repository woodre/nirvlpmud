long_dsc "A pervading darkness fills this room, covering everything in a deep shadow.  Amassive stone gothic styled archway perfectly frames the doorway.  Subtlebrickwork spreads out and wraps around the room.  Each brick has beencarefullycovered in intricately carvings depicting vampiric rituals and scenes of deepdebauchery.  Against the far wall sits a fully stocked bookshelf containingall manner of tomes, books and scrolls.  A deep cherry-wood wardrobe sits nextthe bookshelf, done in a rococo styling.  The door of it sits slightly open,asif inviting one to peer at the contents within.  A large four poster bed restsagainst a wall, and is carefully made and looks to be seldom used.  Dominatingthe center of the room is a large rune inscribed cauldron that is brimmingwith steaming blood.  An aura of magic and power wafts out from it and fillsthe room with a red tinged coppery tanged mist."
