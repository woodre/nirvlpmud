long_dsc "The white wall to wall carpeting in this room is contrasted sharply with thefurniture; a couch and easy chairs all in black leather.  Alarge part of theroom is taken up by it's most striking feature, a glass pool table with blackcanvas.  A rack of cue sticks hangs on the wall, also black.  A door in thewall is half open, leading to a bedroom also done in all white with blackfurniture except for the down comforter which is red.  In that room though,you also are struck by something else of color... a picture of Smokey's wifeand their children...  in a black frame, of course"
