long_dsc "Shadows dance and weave about the room, cast by a several torches lit with achilling black flame and hung in ornate silver sconces on each wall.  Thewalls and floor are made of a well-polished dark stone that seems to absorbnatural light.  In the far corner stands a oaken desk strewn with maps andparchments of all types, testament to some unknown project.  Next to the deskhangs a small cage within which a small dragon covered in iridescent blackscales hisses and stretches its wings.  Against the other wall is a small,cherry wood bed covered in what looks like black silk sheets upon which restsa vicious looking wolverine. It turns its fiery-red gaze on you as you enterthe room and hisses softly.  On the opposite wall, a small fireplace burnswith a warm fire, contrary to the regular decor of the room, and a dimreminder of the owners former life.  A large rug has been placed in the middleof the stone floor decorated with a stylized lionesque creature withdragonlike wings spread, in black silhouette over a bloodred field.  Momentsafter you enter a soft, chilling voice whispers from behind you "What bringsyou to my quarters?""
