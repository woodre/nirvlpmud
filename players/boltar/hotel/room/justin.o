long_dsc "When you arrive you see a large 18th Century bed with black satin sheetsdirectly in the center of the room.  To the right of this bed is amagnificently crafted oak dresser.  To the left you see a nightstand with asingle lamp.  The soft glow of a fire places warms the room.  You see an oldpersian rug lying in front of the fire place.  There is a doorway off to yourleft and right but you cannot see what lies behind these two openings."
