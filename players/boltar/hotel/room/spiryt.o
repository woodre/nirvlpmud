long_dsc "As you enter the room your eyes are drawn to the western wall, constructedentirely of darkened glass, and awaiting the fall of evening so that it canpresent its pastel portrait of colors on the horizon.  The opposite end of theroom has a queen size canopy bed, lace cascading down all around, a burgundyand white rose quilt neatly made up.  The veil of lace is drawn back at thefoot of the bed allowing unfettered viewing of the coming sunset.  Cherryfurniture and a huge walk in closet full of outfits decorate the northernwall, while a small table and dining/kitchen area decorate the southern wall. Posters of unicorns and roses abound, and a hammock of teddy bears sits in thenortheast corner above the bed."
