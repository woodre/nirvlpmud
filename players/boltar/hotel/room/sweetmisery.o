long_dsc " You have entered a den of evil. Dark ruby curtains hang from the wall to keepall light from entering. A large four poster bed is surrounded by deep royalpurple mosquito netting. On it sits a petite elf that from her looks you wouldthink she is harmless. All except for the fact that she is sharpening a wickedlooking blade. She handles the blade as if it were a lover instead of akilling tool. Her large breasts and shapely legs are distracting and her coalblack eyes seem to draw you into their mesmerizing depths. As you wrench yourgaze free you notice an altar with a wax figurine of the god Shardak upon it.Just as you turn to look at her again, she is two inches away with her bladeat your throat. "Do you like the decor? I think you will add nicely to thedecorations when I hang you by your wrists and torment you for weeks." Hergirlish giggle contradicts her intentions as she leads you to the Iron Crossin the corner of the room and shackles you in place. She smiles as you startto scream."
