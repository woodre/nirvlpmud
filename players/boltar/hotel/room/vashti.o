long_dsc "Vashti's Room!A large canopy bed resides on the opposite wall.  Next to the bed is a smallnight table where a beautiful oil lamp sits, glowing softly.  Next to the lampis a small picture frame engraved with the words "Forever devoted to mylove..." The picture is of a very handsome warrior.  You recognize his faceand realize it must be her beloved husband Talen.  There is also a letterlying next to the lamp written in Vashti's own beautiful handwriting, itappears to be a love letter, you glance to see whom she writes and you are notsurprised to find that is her beloved Talen, the lucky warrior that he is. You look at the letter and begin to read it, "My dearest, you are such a bravewarrior and I thank you for rescuing my heart.  You have motivated me to takemy life in a positive direction and I will forever thank you for this.  Thedays we spend together are very precious and the nights more so.  You aresurely the most romantic man in the world and I am very proud to be yourwife." The letter goes on and you notice that she is expressing deep feelings,making you feel like an intruder.  You decide to stop reading only to wishthat you had a relationship filled with such loyal romance.  You look forsomething else to take your mind off of their deep emotions and your eyesshift to a painting on the wall, the painting is magnificent of a large blackhorse equipped for war.  You are in awe of this room and the woman who keepsit."
