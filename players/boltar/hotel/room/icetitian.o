long_dsc " as soon as you enter the room you gasp in astonisment you wonder how they fita room the big in the hotel. The room has a hot tub in the corner designed  tolook like a hot spring. Icecicles hang from the ceiling a huge blue bed is inthe back of the room on the right hand side. In the middle of the room thereis a large round steel table with many chairs and two small couches. And thisis one of the few rooms in the hotel that has a sky light."
