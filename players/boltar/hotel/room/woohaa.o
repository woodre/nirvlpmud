long_dsc "  The room is a huge mess.  In the back of the room there is aa large pile of straw used for a bed.  On the walls headsof different denizens are hanging.  In one corner sits a smallweapon rack with various swords.  An empty case is hangingfrom the wall.  On the bottom of the case is a small plaque witha single word etched in it, APOCALYPSE."
