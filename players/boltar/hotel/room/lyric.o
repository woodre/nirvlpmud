long_dsc "A riot of brightly colored tapestries adorn three of the four wallsof Lyric's room, creating warmth and life in spite of the dull stock wallcolor.  One side of the room sports four padded upright chairs, eachwith a black metal lyre, as well as a cherry cabinet with glass doors tohouse both instruments and volumes of sheet music.  In the oppositecorner of the room rests an enormous cherry four-poster bed coveredin a thick, warm quilt whose myriad of colors match the walls, and asturdy cherry wardrobe, tightly closed.  On the wall opposite the door,a tidy fireplace warms two overstuffed chairs and a small couch, whichsit upon a thick white rug.  The sweet scent of wildflowers fills the room,emanating from the vase filled with them sitting on a stand by the door.The room reflects the joy and tranquility in Lyric's soul."
