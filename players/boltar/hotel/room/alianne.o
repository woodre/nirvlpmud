long_dsc " Your feet sink into the plush silver-gray carpet as you step into the room. A glass sliding door leads out to the balcony, with sapphire blue curtainstied back as a frame around them.  Out the door you can see forest coveredhills.  The bed is neatly set in the middle of the right hand wall.  A canopyof lace with embroidered silver dolphins cascades down the four poster bedmade of a strong rich oak.  The storm gray comforter is turned down at the topshowing the same sapphire color of sheets in a rich satin or silk fabric. Along the left wall you see a small kitchenette which must be the source ofthe wonderful aroma filling the room."
