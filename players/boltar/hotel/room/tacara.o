long_dsc "This is an average hotel room.  It does not look as if Tacara has botheredto personalize it at all.  There is a brown carpet on the floor, and thewalls are painted an off-white colour.  A plain wooden dresser and a bedto match it stand against one wall, and there is an old ratty easy chairin the corner.  The closet door is half open and you can see a fewarmors and weapons that look like they were tossed in there a bithaphazardly."
