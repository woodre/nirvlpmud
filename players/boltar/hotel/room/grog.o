long_dsc "As you look around you are utterly astounded by how well keptthis hotel room is. The carpet is pure jet black, as wellas the walls, ceiling, and furniture. Even the little liquorrefridgerator is stylishly black. There are Mudvayne and NINposters and pictures lining every wall and the inside of theentrance door. The entire room smells strongly of marijuanasmoke, and you realize why as you notice a large ziplock bagfull of marijuana and multiple smoking paraphenalias on thesheet-glass table in the center of the room. Amongst the potand paraphenalia are also a large bag of ecstacy pills, severalsheets of acid, and a large bag of cocaine, with razors andstraws laying next to it. This is apparently an often usedparty pad. Hey, if ya see something you wanna do go for it,no one's stopping you. Gotta do something to keep the sanity... Grog 2,239,757 Grog 2,339,658"
