long_dsc "Warmth and luxury define this room, which is clearly Amalee's home awayfrom home.  The rich fabrics hanging from the walls in bright jewel toneswould be an offense to the eye had the many colors not been so expertlyblended to give the room a cheerful, affluent ambiance instead.  The shutterson the west window are tightly closed, but thick silk pillows line itsbroad casement, as well as the large banded trunk beneath the window.  Asmall, neat desk hides in the northwest corner, home to a gold-plated writingset and a tidy stack of expensive looking blank parchment. The desk andadjacent tapestry-upholstered chair are placed so as to best catch thedaylight while returning correspondence.  A stylish sofa with two matchingchairs create a 'sitting room' in the center of the room before the spotlessstone fireplace, the thick, pristine white rug lending a border to thespace and glowing slightly yellow as it reflects the light of the merryfire burning in the hearth.  The northeast corner is home to a large hardwoodwardrobe filled nearly to bursting with beautiful gowns befitting Amalee'sstation.  The oversized four-poster oak bed has a gauzy canopy and is coveredin oppulent comforters and embroidered pillows.  A matching carved oakfloor mirror rests nearby, reflecting the flickering warm light of thedozens of candles twinkling throughout the cozy room."
