long_dsc "This room is large and mostly unfurnished.  Pegs and hooks line the wallswhere the master of the chambers may place his garments and armaments when notin battle.  A large, dark opening in one wall gives off the appearance of agiant dog house with a plaque above the opening that reads, 'Death's Shadow'. You'd hate to see the dog that calls that monstrous den home.  Then, you'reeyes fall on the dominating furnishing of the room.  It is a throne.  Though,unadorned, it radiates power so strongly you can almost taste it on the air. A touch of the armrest makes you gasp as power and strength shoot up your armand fill you with warmth.  You realize why there is no bed.  All one wouldhave to do is sit on that throne to be filled with the strength granted by thelongest sleep.  It also lets them stay awake in case of any attack by anoutside source.  This truly is the dwelling of one of Shardak's greatwarriors."
