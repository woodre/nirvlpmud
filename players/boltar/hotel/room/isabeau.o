long_dsc "The tidy room is dimly lit, but soothing rather than gloomy.Celtic artwork in shades of silver, cranberry and blue graces thewalls, adding depth and tranquility to the space.  A high bedadorned with black wrought-iron scrollwork rests in one cornerbeneath a flowing canopy of silver grey which precisely matchesthe color of the thick down comforter and overstuffed pillows.Two wingback chairs sit invitingly on the thick rug stretched outbefore the small white brick fireplace.  The glistening wood ofthe round occasional table between the chairs matches the gleamingcherry hue of the stately wardrobe standing upright near the bed."
