long_dsc "Stretching out before you is an endless field of various bones, in all shapesand sizes.  Eyeless skulls stare out in all directions, some skyward and someseems to stare at you and into your soul.  You look up to the heavens and thenyou notice a vast swirling funnel of darkness only highlighted by theoccasionalbolt of green colored lightning.  A baying howl then sounds off in thedistancequickly followed by another, soon you hear them from all around.  A windbegins topick up and howl all around.  It is then you pick up the faint sounds ofendlesstormented wails, screams and moans.  The wind beings to pick up and a finelayerof dust stirs up briefely choking you.  Insane gibbering and cackles assailyourthoughts and your mind begins to unravel from reason.  Fear grips your heartyetyou cannot seem to move."
