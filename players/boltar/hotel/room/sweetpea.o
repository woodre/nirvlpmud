long_dsc "             Welcome to Sweet's PlaceAs you look about the room, there are candles placed about.giving off a soft romantic glow to the room.To your left you notice a king size poster bed, that gentallyhas a white tulle draped from the top. There is a big fluffydown comforter, it looks so appealing to lay upon.To your right you notice a small fireplace burning in the corner.surrounding it are a bunch of big, fluffy pillows and a couch that looks asif you would be swallowed up by it if you sat upon it."
