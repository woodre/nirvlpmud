long_dsc "Star's hotel room oozes a sense of calm and serenity from every surface.The walls are a light blue, and the carpet that your feet are sinking sodeeply into is a slightly darker shade.  The wall opposite the door featuresa large magical window showing the sight of a gypsy camp in such detail youfeel as if you are a part of the world Star comes from.  Beyond the campare rolling green fields and a huge expanse of bright blue sky.  The otherthree walls are hung with cases, each containing a different instrument.One case is empty and if you look close enough you can see that the labelon the case says 'Pan Pipes.'  Star's bed is in a corner near her window,covered in blankets and pillows in various shades of blue.  The nightstandnext to the bed is covered with small framed photos of her children."
