long_dsc "You have entered a dark, peaceful place.  The smell of incence and scentedcandles burning, fills the air with calmness and serenity.  There are severalpaintings and murals hanging from the walls deplicting battles won by Hugh,holding the spoils of war in his hands not to mention the player's head.A small shrine is located on the north wall.  It is well lit and most ofthe candles and incence is burning from it.  There is a Naginata, caked in dryblood, resting in a place of honor.  That is the fabled weapon Hugh used tokill his first knight.  There is also a shattered cross from that same knight,resting under the Naginata."
