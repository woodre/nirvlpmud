long_dsc "This is the room of Teiannia.  From somewhere in the back of the room you hearher son scream out for his mother's attention and the growth that he desiresafter tasting blood.  Her son is Hate, and soon he will grow to show the worldthe glory of his breeding.  You hardly notice anything else about the roomthough because you can't see well in the dark that slowly shifts around andengulfs you.  While Teiannia seems peaceful enough, you notice the fire in hereyes, the only thing making her visible to you.  The fire burns at her likethe darkness burns at you and you realize you cannot stand in this room longwithout being consumed by the evil that dwells within."
