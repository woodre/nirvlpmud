On the left sideof the room you see a table with a chair. A note sits on the table reading "Ihave no love life" written serveral different times. On the right side younotice a gleaming fireplace filled with logs. On the floor lays a cream colorscarpet, verry soft to the touch. By the fireplace lays a tall and wide darkblue rug. On the wall by the door you see a comfortable sofa and chair,perfect for loved ones to come and sit,and or friends to come and talk."
