long_dsc "As you enter this magnificent room, you are awe struck by the sheerrichness of your surroundings. The majority of the room is taken by thehuge bed which is apparently intended for Seductress and her one and only.Looking to your left, you see a whirlpool, its motor quietly turning andgently waves flowing along the surface of the water. To your right, apair of solid glass french doors open to a spacious balcony, with a viewof the town, and in the distance the many lands and castles of Nirvana.And, of course, in front of you is the bed, with a huge aquarium actingas a headrest, and little tropical fish swimming around, to create asomewhat 'wet' environment. To the left of the bed, you notice, is atall wooden cabinet. Since you know Seductress, you decide you'd rathernot look in there."
