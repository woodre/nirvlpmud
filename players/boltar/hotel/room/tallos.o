long_dsc "You are teleported high in the sky to a dark castle sitting on a cloud. Itsmassive spires twisting and reaching higher out of sight. Dark figures movealong the battlements, their dark red eyes flickering in the darkness. Youstand before the entrance which is a massive opening covered with archinglightning energy. Passing through the portal you feel the power tug at yoursoul and something scans your thoughts. In front of you in the courtyard is aornate fountain made from night black marble. Two hideous gargoyles perchon the fountain and spew dark water from their open jaws. Stairways into theguard towers and up to the battlements flank the courtyard and a large centralchamber lies in the center. Passing through the open doors you find yourselfstumbling in the dark until you find your way into a large chamber with aglowing fireplace. A set of chairs shaped like terrible winged creaturescenteraround a table with a vase of black roses. The smell hits your nose and liftsyou up like a feather with its aroma. You take a seat and notice a rack ofweapons and armor hanging from the wall beside the fireplace.A large ornate fireplace (Burning)A set of ancient chairsA vase with black roses on a dark oak tableA rack of weapons and armorA Wedding Picture with a dark figure and a beautiful woman"
