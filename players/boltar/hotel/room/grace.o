long_dsc "Grace's room exudes warmth and comfort, despite the clutter.  A simple,yet sturdy, hardwood desk stands against the wall in the northeast corner,where the light from the wide, east-facing window can be used to its bestadvantage when the thick wooden shutters are open.  The window casementis wide enough to be used as a seat, and several comfortable, if well wornand mismatched, pillows decorate its surface.  A heavy, iron-banded trunkrests tightly closed beneath the casement.  A stone fireplace dominates thenorth wall, a fire popping and dancing merrily in its hearth.  Wrought ironcandle holders with lit tapers grace the mantle, the desk, and most otheravailable surfaces, providing enough warm light to read by, even on thedarkest night.  A small tapestry-upholstered fainting couch and twocomfortable armchairs perch on a large, threadbare rug in the center ofthe room.  The modest hardwood wardrobe pressed into the northwestcorner of the room matches the equally modest mission-style bed in thesouthwest corner, although the thick pillows and freshly laundered whitecomforter are clearly new.  Countless books of every size and shape arehaphazardly stacked throughout the room on floor and furniture alike."
