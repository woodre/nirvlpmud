long_dsc "You stand in the midst of a forest with cool moist earth filling beneath yourtoes and a soft patch of moss under an overhanging rock to sleep upon.  Youhear the sound of birds chirping in the trees and the soft russel of the windthrough the leaves.  The sun peaks among the branches shedding just enoughlight into the area to be homey, but not enough to be overpowering.  Smallanimals ca be heard rummaging in the distance, and the sound of a babblingbrook is not far off."
