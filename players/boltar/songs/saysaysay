SAY, SAY, SAY
Words and Music by Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson

Say, say, say what you want
but don't play games with my affection
Take, take, take what you need
but don't leave me with no direction
All alone I sit home by the phone waiting for you baby
Through the years how can you stand to hear my pleading for you dear?
You know I'm crying, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Now go, go, go where you want
but don't leave me here forever.
You, you, you stay away
so long girl I see you never
What can I do girl, to get through to you? Cause I love you baby.
Standing here baptised in all my tears, baby through the years,
You know I'm crying, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
You never ever worry and you never shed a tear.
You're saying that my love ain't real
just look at my face, these tears ain't drying.
You, you, you can nvever say
that I'm not the one who really loves you.
I pray, pray, pray ev'ry day
that you'll see things, girl, like I do.
What can I do girl, to get through to you? Cause I love you baby.
Standing here baptised in all my tears, baby through the years,
You know I'm crying, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
