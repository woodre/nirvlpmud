S-s-s-s  A-a-a-a  F-f-f-f  E-e-e-e  T-t-t-t  Y-y-y-y
Safe, dance!

{Spoken}
We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine
I say, we can go where we want to
A place where they will never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
And we can dance

{Sung}
We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine
I say, we can go where we want to
A place where they will never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
And we can dance
Dance!

We can go when we want to
The night is young and so am I
And we can dress real neat from our hats to our feet
And surprise 'em with the victory cry
Say, we can act if want to
If we don't nobody will
And you can act real rude and totally removed
And I can act like an imbecile

{Refrain}
I say, we can dance, we can dance
Everything out of control
We can dance, we can dance
We're doing it from wall to wall
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody takin' the cha-a-a-ance

Safety dance
Oh well the safety dance
Ah yes the safety dance

S-s-s-s  A-a-a-a  F-f-f-f  E-e-e-e  T-t-t-t  Y-y-y-y
Safe, dance!

We can dance if we want to
We've got all your life and mine
As long as we abuse it, never gonna lose it
Everything'll work out right
I say, we can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine

{Refrain}

Oh well the safety dance, ah yes the safety dance
Oh well the safety dance, oh well the safety da-ance
Oh yes the safety dance, oh it's the safety dance yeah

Ah we can dance if we want to, we can leave your friends behind
Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance

And we can act like we come from out of this world

We can dance if we want to, we can leave your friends behind
