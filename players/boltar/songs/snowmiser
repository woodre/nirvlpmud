The Heat Miser Song
by Maury Laws and Jules Bass 

[Heat Miser]
I'm Mister Green Christmas
I'm Mister Sun
I'm Mister Heat Blister
I'm Mister Hundred and One
They call me Heat Miser,
What ever I touch
Starts to melt in my clutch
I'm too much!
[Chorus]
He's Mister Green Christmas
He's Mister Sun
He's Mister Heat Blister
He's Mister Hundred and One
[Heat Miser]
They call me Heat Miser,
What ever I touch
Starts to melt in my clutch
[Chorus]
He's too much!
[Heat Miser]
Thank you!
I never want to see a day
That's under sixty degrees
I'd rather have it eighty,
Ninety, one hundred degrees!
(spoken):Oh, some like it hot, but I like it really hot! Hee hee!
[Chorus]
He's Mister Green Christmas
He's Mister Sun
[Heat Miser]
Sing it!
[Chorus]
He's Mister Heat Blister
He's Mister Hundred and One
[Heat Miser]
They call me Heat Miser,
What ever I touch
Starts to melt in my clutch
I'm too much!
[All]
Too Much!


  
The Snow Miser Song
by Maury Laws and Jules Bass

[Snow Miser]
I'm Mister White Christmas
I'm Mister Snow
I'm Mister Icicle
I'm Mister Ten Below
Friends call me Snow Miser
What ever I touch
Turns to snow in my clutch
I'm too much!
[Chorus]
He's Mister White Christmas
He's Mister Snow
[Snow Miser]
That's right!
[Chorus]
He's Mister Icicle
He's Mister Ten Below
[Snow Miser]
Friends call me Snow Miser,
What ever I touch
Turns to snow in my clutch
[Chorus]
He's too much!
[Snow Miser]
I never want to see a day
That's over forty degrees
I'd rather have it thirty,
Twenty, ten, five and let it freeeeEEEEEEeeze!
[Chorus]
He's Mister White Christmas
He's Mister Snow
[Snow Miser]
That's right!
[Chorus]
He's Mister Icicle
He's Mister Ten Below
[Snow Miser]
Friends call me Snow Miser,
What ever I touch
Turns to snow in my clutch
... too much.
[All]
Too Much!
