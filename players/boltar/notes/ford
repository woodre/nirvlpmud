This a confusing subject because there are two uses for the term "Y
block".

Starting with the 239 CID of 1954 (130 hp!), Ford termed their new
engines "Y-blocks" to differentiate them from their famous "v-8"
engines.  Just as the earier units were named "v" based on the block's
appearance when viewed end-on, the new blocks more closely resembled an
upper-case "Y".  That is, the bottom skirting extends below the
crankshaft centerline, providing better support for the bearing-webs.

When the 1958 introduction of the 332 and 352, Ford again wanted to
differentiate this new series.  The new buzzword was "big V-8s", but the
internal codename was "FE", meaning the new engines cut across the Ford
& Edsel carlines.  Based on their physical appearance, the new blocks
would qualify as "Y blocks".  However, appearance aside, the FEs had
many brand-new design features separating them from earlier engines and
these necessitate the two engine-series remaining distinct.  

Perhaps the most obvious differences are these:

-  "Y-block" lifters are loaded externally, from near the oilpan;
   "FE" lifters are loaded from behind the cylinder heads.
-  "Y-block" timing sprockets have no marks to align; "FE"s do.
-  "FE" intake manifold acts as the engine top-cover, extending
   beneath the rocker cover on each cylinder head.
