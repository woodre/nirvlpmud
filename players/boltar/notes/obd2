Currently, this is the cheapest datalogger I have found:
http://www.obd-2.com/

$122 gets you the interface and the software.

I bought EaseSim last year.
http://www.easesim.com/

Their software/interface is $300 for the lowest model.

However, standard OBDII only lets you grab something like 10 samples
per second.  It is a real pain in the butt.

I know for a fact that there are other packages out there for Fords
that know the code that will let you sample at many more times per
second.  I don't know if EaseSim or the obd-2 one do this or not.

I use EaseSim to datalog my O2 voltages, ignition timing and RPM when
I am doing the 1/4mi.  The knock sensor directly affect ignition timing.
So I can see how close to knock I am.  Then, using my Super AFC, I can
lean out or richen up the RPM band that looks like it is off.

Works great as a tuning tool.
