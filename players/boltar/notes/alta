:       Tom Scott <kc7cc@azstarnet.com> mentioned in several posts 
:       that he was in Tucson (circa mid-1996). Even if Altavoz is 
:       Tom Scott he may or may not be in or near Tucson now.  

On or about June 3 '96, he changed his ID from <kc7cc@azstarnet.com> to 
<altavoz@azstarnet.com>.  The <kc7cc> posts stopped, and the <altavoz> 
posts started up, on that date.  Checking posts from both ID's, there's 
no question: it's the same guy.

But, there's more.  Altavoz has said several times he's an "advanced 
class" ham radio operator.  An ham radio callsign database shows
that the callsign "KC7CC" (advanced class) is assigned to one 
Thomas L. Scott, Tucson AZ 85747.
