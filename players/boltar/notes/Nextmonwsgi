Worked on a Indy, Indigo2, and happily on a O2.  One thing of note
you will want to force the refresh to 60Hz on Indy, I2 (didn't mess
with this much on O2 just used standard setting @ 60Hz)..

Also you'll have to crack the case and adjust horizontal and vertical
sizes to accomodate the different refresh rate.

Been working fine for years and on the SGI's I actually prefer the hitachi's
over the Sony..  Though I use my 20E21 @ 1600x1200 on a PC with
Matrox Card (the other reason Matrox is nice - sync on green) and am
extremely happy with it.
