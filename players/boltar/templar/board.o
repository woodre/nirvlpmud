Here are some rules to keep in mind when dealing with items left in the room.1) All non-tox heals shall be left for pkers (May be moved to Elite room)2) All weapons and armors of good quality should be left for those in need or distributed to newbies.  DO NOT TAKE ALL AND SELL!3) If abundance of coins left, please take a max of 40k.4) Do not take heals just to sell them.All else, I trust knights and allies to use their best judgment.  This is the only room in castle (except elite), which does not reset.  Please leave things for your fellow knights and allies if you can.  Elites, please only leave non-tox in Elite room.Also, rules 2, 3, and 4 may be ignored if in DESPERATE need (read died and got corpse stolen, couldn't get corpse back, etc).Note about Templar Security Guards, to be fully active you must first "awaken" them by visiting the Equipment Room.  Only then will they begin to roam the halls of Fortress Stone.-Eurynomous, Templar Advocate*** I will be compiling a list of areas with evil mobs for both exp and   coins. Please mudmail me with contributions.* Please be sure to properly report a crime by a criminal when you add   them to the record. There is a numbered legend for each specific   type of crime. I will now be able to view all newly added records   and will be making certain criminals are noted correctly.* Please be on the look out for new recruits. It is the job of EVERY   single knight to be actively recruiting. There are many new players   starting on Nirvana and this is a wonderful opportunity for us.* There will soon be a quest available (through Lacar) for prospective   allies. Please forward any questions regarding the Alliance to her.* A quest for Elite membership is also in the works and should be ready   soon. Please direct questions regarding the Elites to any current   Elite member or to myself. We will be reviewing the positions within   the Elite guard shortly.* It is VERY important that you do not use your knowledge gained from   your knight character to benefit that of any other character you   play or their guilds, ESPECIALLY if they are an evil, opposing   guild. To do so will likely result in stiff punishments, with the   possibility of removal.* The spell "holy_ground" is now only available within the castle.* NEW NEW NEW: Please take the time to look around the castle as a few   rooms have changed descriptions AND locations. There are a few more   changes in the works, so please be aware that our castle is having   some renovations. Thank you for your patience and hopefully we'll   have everything completed soon!* Be sure to check out the website at:   http://www.geocities.com/knightstemplarofnirvana   Please register for the forums and make use of it :)GC Larisa**Please be aware that there will be several rooms moving around thecastle this coming week. We're having a major layout change to cutdown on some space and to rearrange rooms into a more logical way.1. Equipment Room (1u)2. Elite Room (2u)3. War Room (1w)4. Templar Private rooms (1e)5. Gadvey (portals) (1e,d)6. Lockers (1u,1e)7. Templar storage (1u,1w,1n)8. Arena (Feldegast's) (1u,1w,1s)9. Feast Hall (4s, 1e)10. Shop (2s,1e)11. Louis is now located within the Feast HallGC Larisa**Info files are going to be updated over the next few days. You cannow use 'info map' to view the updated map of our castle. If you seeany typos or errors, please mail Jara as she's taking on the project.Larisa**The Elite mini-quest is finally done.  Yeah I know, it'sabout time you slow .....  Anyhow it is now in the game.Any elite knight can now 'recruit' a fellow knight to become an elite guardsman.  Those that are recruitedwill have to visit Jacoby (located s,w) of here.  I didsome initial testing and it worked fine for me but thereare generally some problems now and then.  If you come acrosssomething send me some mail.  It's not an easy quest either sogood luck :)Frep**From this point onward ALL Templars (yes even elites) are to strictlyfollow the rules on the tablet.  This guild WILL follow them to theletter, and if any are caught bending, breaking or abusing them, thenyou will be expelled and your exp will be lost as will be anythingelse you had in the guild.  This is the end of the discussion on thisso deal with it, the open friendly approach has made more problemsthen it has helped things, and since you all seem to need laws/rulesto follow this is the final decision on this.**You know some of you fail to understand character separation or that this is an entirely separate guild from the other guilds around here,Yes yes the Shardaks are the, current, top pk guild around, though their numbers are not robust.  But some knights would rather play astheir shardaks then their knights.  That in its self is not wrong, butwhat is wrong is that they log on their knights long enough to see whatis going on in this guild, then to use that said information to thebenefit of their shardak guild mates.  I know who you are and this isnow going to fall under the 'ZERO TOLERANCE' policy.  I consider thisan act of pure betrayal.  You are not being true to the guild and willbe removed.  I am sick to death of learning of leaks from those thatare not in the guild nor do they have a character that is in the guild.This extends to the non elites as well, so do not think you are immunejust because your not an elite.  Also take note 'allies' that are doingthis as well.....**Please check the sponsor board daily. Sometimes we dont and there are names there that need sponsors. Please take the time to check it and speak with any of those that might be listed there. Thank you.Salina**Greetings all,Just thought I'd leave a note here to inform everyone thatthe ninjas have been getting into the ghall.  When you usethe portal command at Gadvey it is possible for them to enter the portal that is created which leads to the roomthat Gadvey is in.  I think they are basically trapped inthat room unless they kill Gadvey but I'm sure it could bedone.  So far only Hadus has been doing it but I'm sure otherswill soon follow if he has any success with it.The Noobie One.  **The note is titled 'Board & Guild Info Update'The board was getting full, so I have condensed a lot of notes.- * denotes unread messages- DO NOT place a comma (,) in the subject line of any header.Example: note blah, blah   (THIS IS A NO NO!!)- Now you can just type 'read' at the board and it will auto read any unread messages.- 'info map' for map of Guild Hall- If you ever log on without your cross re-log or go to the Tower of Hope and type 'restore'.  DO NOT EVER ask a wizard to hand you a new guild object, and if one offers DO NOT LET THEM.  This is a big no-no.- When you report bugs of any kind about the Templar please leave detailed information on what you were doing prior and after any such "bugs" were shown.  I want a snapshot of your inventory and a descripton of the error message (if any) you received from anything that went awry.  These things will help me clear out any problems when you are not here for me to take a look at.- All stats can be maxxed to 30 except for magic (25) and stealth (20).- Templar / Alliance AFK command now "t_afk" due to mud afk command.- Seek out Jeserius in Templar Church for new command (currently broken).Rage is the Elite LieutenantSlacker is the Templar AmbassadorSharel is the Judge AdvocateSalina is the Judge AmbassadorAny issues regarding knight or ally behavior should be mud mailed to myself or Sharel for right now. (please cc both) Also, if you know of someone made a criminal who didn't commit a crime, please report this as well, along with the knight who crimmed them if you know.SalinaJudge Ambassador**The note is titled 'Squire Info Update'1) Squires now acquire more HP/SP per level gained.2) Squires do not "disappear" from the Feast Hall when they die.  Instead, a Squire will lose 1/2 of his/her experience and return to the Feast Hall.  I will not be increasing the number of squires available b/c of the boot times.  You are no longer limited to one Squire per boot anymore.Handy's Squire Hints:1) They are not tanks2) If you run from a fight and don't calm upon reentering the room your squire will more than likely die.3.) Even squires need to occasional hug.  Show them you love them.  Just thought this could help with those lil' rascals.SalinaJudge Ambassador**The guild hall is closed. This means that no one other than Templar, Allies and wizards should be inside it. There should be no non-allies idling in the ghall or unidle, even in templar rooms. If you have a problem with this rule, feel free to speak to me about it. But be warned, do not come to me with an attitude. This rule is not being applied because I have my 'panties in my crack'. It is being applied because it is a rule for a reason.NO allies or templar should be empowering weapons for non-allies. Do not be caught doing this. Also, if you give a weapon away or sell it, make sure it is not empowered. This is a privilege for allies and templar ONLY.I am trying to watch those that I ally. If you have the privilege of making allies please be careful. I will fight any and all of those that apply for alliance status if they are known to party with criminals or help them in any way. If that means your friend isnt allied and you have a problem with that, feel free to bring it to me. I am very proud of this guild and I am trying to take my job seriously. But I will not tolerate being given attitude over rules that have been around for a long time and I am now trying to make sure they are enforced. If you cannot accept the rules, find another guild. If I find that this is happening too much with any individual, I will take action on it. And you will be looking for a new home.Thank you.Salina, Judge Ambassador**Salina is making points she shouldn't have to make.  Part of being a Knight Templar is playing the roleof this guild.  To protect Nirvana from evil andto protect allies and guild mates.  We are the protectors of this realm.  If we can not protectthe guild hall or the powers we receive from thestaff in the guild hall we are not doing what weshould be doing.  Some of Salina's word are heavy handed but the point is simple.  You play thisguild to be righteous and pure of heart.  You  play this guild to be a Knight and if you can notadhere to that set of rule maybe you are not cut outfor this guild.Jarana - Ex-General of the Elite Guard.  Resident Badass **Do NOT empower or bless weapons for anyone that is not an ally or fellow Knight. These two abilities are special privileges for ONLY alliance and Templars. No matter how much someone offers you to do it, or is willing to trade, etc.. Empower and bless are ONLY for Templar and Alliance. Please do not let me see more non-allies running around with empowered and blessed weapons.SalinaJudge Ambassador**Likewise, if I catch a templar doing this after this ample warning, Iwill suspend powers.  IF an ally does this they are goign to be removedit is getting old having people skirt things and I will take a ironfistedstance towards it.SharelJudge Advocate**If you haven't already, take a look a "info alliance" - there's some good guidance in there as far as establishing, caring and feeding of alliance members.Ambassador Slacker**Well, for some apparant reason many of the Rangers have chosen to not follow the path they chose themselves, but instead to go along a darker path. Recently I have noticed a couple of these rangers (not all, please understand there are GREAT rangers here) who have decided to steal, harass or whatever they can to harm others playtimes here. I, for one, do not feel that after choosing to be a Power Ranger, you have the right to steal or harass other players. I will be watching and please let me know if you see any of this behavior going on. If said ranger is in alliance, they need not be doing this type of activity.Just last night, a Vampire by the name of Nolee, was in the shop selling some items. She had just purchased 80k worth of roots and 50k of lowtox heals. She had several items in the bag to sell and as soon as she finished, was heading to the Ooze to fight. She does not have high stats, so placed the bag on the floor and was selling items out of it as Whitehawk entered the shop. He took the bag and sold all the items in it as she was standing there. He then looked at her, said oh was that yours and when she said yes, he handed her 40k, then dropped a bunch of coins on floor of shop and quickly grabbed them back up and logged off.When he logged back on a few minutes later, I spoke to him about what happened and he had an attitude. Not only did he have one with me then, he chose to log in this morning and talk about donating Nolee's baby and how he wished he could have to 'piss her off'. I do not believe this is acceptable. Maybe Im wrong. He says he did not see her in shop, but she wasnt invisible. How could he not? From the log I have, it shows him entering, her taking an item from the bag, selling it then he picks it up, gets all from it, and sells right away.Another Ranger offered to pay Nolee for her trouble if I would drop this, but is this what I should do? Seems letting him get away with this type of behavior will not only affect those already playing here, but maybe those who come new in the future. I had already witnessed another ranger following around a vampire with armfulls of light before, which is harassment. I want to make sure that none of these people become Allies. We do not need this in our guild. Please help me by letting me know if you see any of this type of activity going on. If so, I will try and find what seems to be the problem and maybe we can fix it somehow.Thank you.Sincerely,Salina**I would like to see if maybe we can start posting names of those who are wishing to join the Alliance here on the board so that others can let us know of their experiences with them, good or bad, and we can make the right decision in letting them join or not. If we could all put our opinions together, we could have a very strong alliance and that is very important. We could post a name, give it say 3 days for responses, then make a decision. Is this possible?With all the thieving and harassment and other issues going on, I want us to be very careful who we allow into the Alliance. I, for one, will be taking more time in deciding whether to allow someone to join Alliance or not, after watching them and how they act for a little time. Thank you for your ideas and input on the idea. =)Sincerely,Salina**Ok. So we need to figure a few things out and Im trying to do that. But I need to say.. Knights are a good aligned guild. Not everyone on the game keeps their alignment that way, at times, even our alignment might slip. We cannot go around and threaten to place people on the criminal list just because of their alignment. You can warn them once and it is their choice whether they change their alignment but alignment is NOT a reason to be placed on a criminal list and we are at NO time to harass with threats.Also, it is not our job to go around and accuse others of stealing corpses. Unless we were there, we do not know who took it. And we are not going to go around and accuse people who are not criminals and have not broken any rules of stealing corpses or killing someone if we were not present to see it happen. We are not in the game to speculate about someone else's character.Im really tired of getting mails and tells about how our Knights are acting. I think we all need to sit back and read through all our rules, read through all our posts, talk to others, ask questions. We need to make sure this is the guild for us and that we can act like Knights and not like children having temper tantrums. We do not OWN this game nor do we wish to run anyone away from this game. We are here to uphold the good and to make sure that good prevails against evil. Not to act like the devil ourselves.SalinaJudge Ambassador**Greetings to everyone, I wanted to leave a post on the board to let anyone in need of any gear know, they may send me a mail to help aid them.  And for those that don't need the help, remember to follow our tablets creed and offer help to those less fortunate.Sir Marek**he wishes to be a ally of the knights i have known him for a while he is good heart and i dont see a problem please comment and talk to him he under stands the code of honor and knight hood**Greetings everyone, I wanted to compile a list of areas where everyone here can go to coin.This is by no means a list of area's we are restricted to.
