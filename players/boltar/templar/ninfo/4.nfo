		-=[ Rule 4 ]=-


Destroy all evildoers in the land.  These are the
criminals, thieves, and murderers of the realm.
Never ally with evil, for it will destroy your
spirit.
Those who commit acts of harrasment and murder
are deemed killable. As are those with an evil
alignment or targeted as criminals. Kill them to
preserve what is good in the realm.
