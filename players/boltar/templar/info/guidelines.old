Templar Knights have a few rules that we will follow..  Granted these are ment
as guidelines, and any breaking of these rules will be examined for 
circumstance before judgement is made.
1.  If at all possible, all Knights should come to the defense of a fellow  
knight.  The only exception to this rule is if the knight in question is to
be dishonorably removed from the guild.

2.  A Templar should attempt to help anyone of good alignment who asks for 
our help.  This help should be given regardless of guild, but the person asking
for help should have thier past histiry taken in to account by the Knight.
Use your own judgement on this, but please remember, we don't need to help
someone who kills knights for a pastime.

3. PK is not required, but it is allowed.  PK should be for good reason -only-.
Threats or insults are not reason for PK by a knight.
PK is used by knights to punish evil in Nirvana. Evil is done by action.
(killing kids, pets, newbies, or players otherwise unable to defend themselves)

4.  If there is an argument or disagreement inside the guild, which is not all
that uncommon, and a GC is not online, the most senior guild level Knight shall
resolve the problem.  If the disagreement is not settled satisfactorily in 
the mind of one or more knights, then mail the GC's and the matter will be 
resolved  when , at a later time, a GC logs in.

5.  Should a GC find that a Templar Knight has broken one of the guild laws, 
the knight's guild powers will be suspended until the case has been reviewed by
the GC's.
