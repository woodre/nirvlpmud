   Suspension will be dealt out as punishment for disobedience or
for breaking the code of honor. Any council member has the power
to suspend a fellow knight.

Commands:

suspend <who>   - This will suspend the member.

restore <who>   - This will return the member back to active status.


This is to be considered a heavy punishment, whereas leaving the
Knight completely defenseless. Use it carefully.
