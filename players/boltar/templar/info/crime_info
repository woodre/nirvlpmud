Criminals are the enemies of the Knights Templar.  They are
the muderers and thieves that plague Nirvana.  In order to
keep track of our foe, we have a criminal list.  It is every 
Knights responsibility to log criminal activity (refer to the 
Tablet), and pardon a criminal once they have paid with their 
life.  It is important to note that crimes must be logged
to when they occur, for the person must be logged on. Folowing 
is a list of command to help aid you:

cwho
criminal <name>
*record <name> <crime-type> <details of situation>
pardon <name>

*crime-type must be an integer:
1  Pet/Kid Killer
2  Thief
3  Attacking Ally
4  Muderering Ally
5  Repeat Offender
6  Sworn Enemy

Examples: 
record badplayer 1 Badplayer killed my squire
record badplayer 2 Badplayer stole the coins from my kill.
record badplayer 3 Badplayer attacked me when I was in Fallen Lands.
record badplayer 4 Badplayer killed newbie for no reason.
