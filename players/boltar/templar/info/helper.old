You have the following commands for your helper:

command drop (item)             : Commands your helper to drop an item
command drop all                : Commands your helper to drop all
command drop all money          : Commands your helper to drop all money
command get (item)              : Commands your helper to get an item
command get all                 : Commands your helper to get all
command emote (str)             : Makes your helper emote
command sell (str)              : This only works in a shop
command buy (str)               : Likewise, this only works in a shop
command call                    : Calls your helper if he lags behind
crush                           : Destroy Helper


Your helper won't be able to help you in fighting
as he is not trained for battle.  In fact, he is
so frail that he could die any moment.
