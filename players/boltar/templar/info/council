                    -=[Info Council]=-
The council will be made up of a total of 6 Knights.
The job of the council is to answer questions regarding the
rules and code of honor of the knights.
  They will also be responsible in punishing Knights for
misconduct.  Such punishments will range from tasks that
fit the crime, to suspension of powers, or even banishment
from the guild.
  The next duty of the council is to declare war on another
guild or group.  In order to declare war, the council must
reach a majority vote, and have GOOD reason to do so. War
will make all members of the opposing group subject to criminal
status.
    The council will also declare allies.  In doing so, any
guild/individual made into an ally will have the full protection
of the guild.  Allies are to be treated with respect at all
times.
     Lastly, the council will create new policies that pertain
to the knights code.  All policies will be brought before a
guild wizard before being introduced.

For any comments/concerns/questions about the council, please
mudmail either Dragnar or Maledicta.  Your opinions do count.
