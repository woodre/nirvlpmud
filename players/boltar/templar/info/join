 
Knights Templar
 

The Knights Templar are based upon the group of 12th Century Knights
of the same name. Their purpose was to protect travelers through the
holy land at the time of the crusades.
A more detailed history will be avialible with 'info history'

As a Knight you may improve your fighting ability, however your
magical abilities will suffer as will your ability to move undetected.
 
The knights have some magical ability which will be evident upon 
entry into the guild. However the knights are good, and are bound to
remain that way. If a knight should slip away from good, he will find
that his power has left him.
 
Do to the nature of the Knights, Knights who kill others for no reason
or pray upon the weak will suffer the penalty of death at the hands of 
his fellow Templars after being removed from the guild. 
The Templars are to aid and protect those who cannot protect themselves 
from groups or individuals who roam about to prey upon the weak.
