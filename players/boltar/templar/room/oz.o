long_dsc "You have just entered a Tower of the Castle StoneYou notice chains bolted into the wall.They apperently were used to tie down some sort of creature.What sort of creature needed chains that big to be restrained? You wonder.You begin scanning through the list of unholy creatures you have slain.You look back at Oz and relize.........Those were the chains that once held him captive from wrecking his havok.Khrell has given him a new direction of a holy, yet unholy quest.Murder, Chaos, Blood. In his name Oz does his bidding.Oz has been unleashed........"
