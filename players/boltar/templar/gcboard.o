messages "Greetings!(larisa, Sep  9):**This is the private GC board. Feel free to use it instead of, or inaddition to mudmail. It is off limits to those less than guild rank9. There are still a few Elites with that rank, but when we see themon, we do need to lower their rank to 8. I believe we can changesome rank 9 commands to use rank 10, and allow the Elite Generalrank 9 in order to use Elite commands, as well as have access to thisroom.Larisa**Usage of this board(salina, May  2):**I feel that since we have been given this board, we need to start using it. There are alot of changes in command going on right now and those of us that are still active should talk about things that need to be talked about and since we are not all on at the same time, this is a good way to do it.So please, lets start communicating and bring this guild back to what it should be. Its time to recruit, train and have a strong force against evil again!SalinaJudge Ambassador**Allies and Smack talking(sharel, May  6):**No more talking smack, period.  Any and all officers that wittness anywithin the guild or the alliance, should take instant action.  Lettingeven one slip by creates a chink in the armor.  United we stand, dividedwe will fail.  I support Salina and what she has in store.  I regret not being more of a presence here, but that will change, I've been morefocued on other things, but will be here, and will enforce a strict andtotal adherence to the rules and ways we are to act.-Sharel Judge Advocate**Angry(salina, Jun  6):**Just so everyone is aware.. I have had a recent conversation with our newest member, Saynt. It led to him being rude and disrespectful to me which I will tolerate only once because I was extremely tired and had been gone for a few days. But now I have a feeling that the conversation was shared with a non-ally and I am very angry about this. If I find proof it did happen, I will not only terminate his powers, he will be looking for a new guild. Am I wrong for feeling this way? One day in the guild and there is already drama. I will not put up with the attitude OR our business put out for others to be aware of.He is angry that his friend, Parasite, a power ranger, is not welcome as an ally. But because of her partying with a criminal, I will fight any attempt made to ally her. If this is not acceptable, then I can step down from my position. But hopefully each of you will understand my stand on this.We really need to get things under control in the guild and I am going to do my best to do my part. Please stand strong with me. If not, I'll do it alone, but hopefully I will not have to.Thank you very much,Salina, Judge Ambassador**my input(slacker, Jun  9):**All,As far as Parasite is concerned, and the charge against her that she partied with a criminal (thus making her ineligable to be an ally) - a couple of questions... did she know that the person(s) she was partying with was a criminal? I'm not sure how "ignorance" plays into this.Also, if she -was- aware, then how long must she wait, or what must she do to clear her name and be reconsidered?Surely we acknowlege the will of others to mend their ways.Ambassador Slacker**My Thoughts(sharel, Jun  9):**Firstly, you do not stand alone Salina.  You are an officer, you earned that which you have in here.  Officers are due respect by the fellowKnights.  Though I have heard that he is looking into becomming a officerof some sort within our guild.  As I understand it, We three are it asfar as regular templars are, the Elites are a bit more vague, as therereally isn't any elites to speak of that actively play, and since theOz fallout, there has not been a need for a 'Elite General'.I Agree things need to be dealt with at once, letting things slide, or waiting to act on them tends to have a negative effect as a whole.  Sadthat things like this creep up.  It is getting to the point that we mighthave to remove names from the sponsor board until all officers can guagethe person and get formal input from active knights.Sharel the Judge Advocate**re: my input (slacker, Jun 9)(salina, Jun 13):**Yes, she knew she was partying with a criminal. And when she was called out on it, she got angry and now proudly states she 'hates' the person who called her out on it. Personally, I feel she does not deserve or want to become an ally and I will oppose it unless she does a HUGE turn around and I dont see that happening. She cannot character separate, she cannot roleplay and talks badly about her guild mates. I do not want someone like that as part of our Alliance. **Semper Fi(stone, Oct  9):**Just stopping by to see how things are going for you all.  I miss the knights and the players who made them special--best of luck to you all!SALUTEStone**gkill_check(larisa, May  7):**The command seems to be working as intended now.Thanks much to Fred!GC Larisa**Greetings!(larisa, May 22):**It has been long since I have been in the realm. I hope all has been well.I am going to put together some notes for the crier, so please let me knowif there are any specific items of news or notes to give to him.Larisa**Check in?(larisa, May 25):**I wanted to get an idea of who is around, active and still interested in maintainingtheir ranks. Let me know, as I have Knights interested in advancing.Larisa**Hmm(marek, May 27):**Just out of curiosity, how many positions are there? Marek**Re: Hmm(larisa, Sep 13):**There's the Guild Commander, Judge Advocate, Ambassador and the Elite General.4.Larisa**"
