tmp_text "Hello Stone.I rather resent the remark about shardaks not fightin honorably.this note is a bit late....but, oh well...Winter**berl..i am kind of confused by your note....who are you talkign about ..and what exactly are you questioning? I think we know whats honorable and whats not ..and standing by and watching a guildmate get attacked and not helping out i would certainly think would almost be aginst nature...i am just a little confused about this note ..*hugs* Akasha**Well....personally I have yet to see or hear of a knight attackingsomeone who was unarmed.  With or without heals is not our concern.I also have yet to hear of a knight killing a newbie without goodcause....enough cause to legalize the action for a knight.(An example of thiswould be Jebuly killing a newbiebecausehe was asked to since the newbie had been tricked into setting her pk.It is common knowledge on this mud that knights will help and/or assist other knights by guild law.  Considering this is common knowledge,those who attack a knight should think twice knowing that they are notjust attacking one knight, but any who may be available to help thier brother/sister.  Being honorable is what you put into it.Some people consider it dishonorable to pk at all.  Others feel thatpeople should get as good as they give.  Being intelligent about asituation is a good start.  If you disagree, post it here and don'tdo it yourself.If it enough of a problem, of if there is a question at allabout the act, it -will- be looked into by the GC's.  So far, Ihave not been informed of anything that, once investigated, couldnot be deemed the best choice the knight had in the given situation.If there is any question, please bring it up to a GC.  We cannotsee everything and do rely on our brothers and sisters for help.Marie**I do believe that this subject has been effectively addressed now.Lets change the subject shall we?Merry Christmas Knights!!  :)Marie**I just want to post this so you all know. Deamonsweat stole the corpse of Valkyrie and when asked to give back her things he and another made joke of it on channels. Now i dont; know what a punishment might be for this ..but certainly i would propose that we don;t party with him and help him in anyway if he so choses to steal from a sister. Please leave me your thoughts and let me know if i am on the right track here. Thanks, Akasha**  Frankly, I do not believe that once someone chooses to forsake our wayof life, we should embrace them for readmittance to our brotherhood forany reason.  They were once one of us and departed, let themremain forever departed......  -Stypend**Jade has been denied admittance to the knights.She is not to be sponsored.Marie**As of today,  there will be no sponsorship fornew members to the guild until further notice.Due to the removal of the shardacks and our currentstatus ...(we don't -need- members) the GC'sfeel that this would be to the guilds best intrests at this time.I will tell you now that the command 'sponsor' isstill active.  It will not be removed.  Do notpresume that it would be removed if we did not want members.This notice is all that is needed.I do not wish to make an example of a Knight shouldhe/she disobey this new order, but I will not hesitate to recommend removal from the guild if this is disobeyed.The GC's**As you may or may not know I have recently married Shiverheart...His evil intentions have been somewht altered by his love for me and who I am...He respects my beliefs and what I stand for...His honor is impecable and he has my undying devotion...Please be happy for us..Dyan, wife of Shiverheart and Khights Templar**I was asked to party by Snakespear today...I turned him down becasue i remember hearing his name here about something..I have asked several times and no one seems to know what he did ..if anything will someone please clear this up?Thank you, Dyan**He's attacked Marie, nuff said on this poor soul.**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
