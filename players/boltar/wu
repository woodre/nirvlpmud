 ./build lnx

IMPORTANT NOTICE

Beginning with version 2.6.0, the WU-FTPD Development Group is moving the
build process to use GNU Autoconf.  Until this move is completed, both
build systems will remain supported.  You are encouraged to use the new
"configure" command to select options, then "make" to compile the daemon.
For details on this, read the README.AUTOCONF file.
If problems occur, please report them to the development group via email to
wuftpd-members@wu-ftpd.org  We are soliciting feedback on the new
configuration process, and your help is greatly appreciated.

If you choose to continue to use the original build process, bear in mind
it will be phased out over the next few releases: when we are reasonably
sure the new configuration system works for most target platforms.

Sleeping for five seconds, sorry for the interruption.
