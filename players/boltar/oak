Insecticides labeled for use by homeowners against scale crawlers on oaks include cyfluthrin (Bayer Advanced Garden Power Force Multi-Insect Killer Concentrate), permethrin (Spectracide Bug Stop Multi-Purpose Insect Control Concentrate), malathion (Ferti-lome Mal-A-Cide or Hi-Yield Malathion Insect Spray), and carbaryl (Sevin 50WP or Ferti-lome Carbaryl Spray). Apply one of these materials when crawlers appear and repeat in 10 days. Monitor the crawler emergence with sticky cards, double-faced tape wrapped around a branch, or by putting an infested shoot or leaf into a baggie and watching for crawler movement. As with all pesticides, read and follow all label instructions and precautions.
