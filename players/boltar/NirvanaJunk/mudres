My name is Gretchen Shipman and I am a student at Central Piedmont
Community College. I am doing a research project on MUDs. Please take a
few seconds to answer these ten questions. I would really appreciate it.
Thanks!

1.    How many players visit your MUD on a typical day?
2.    On which day do the highest number of players mud?
3.    How many coders are currently working on your MUD?
4.    How do you choose your coders and immortals?
5.    How many hours do you require that you coders and immortals work
on your    MUD each week if any?
6.    How many hours do you spend working on your MUD each week?
7.    What makes your MUD unique?

8.    Do you play on other MUDs?
       If yes, which MUDs do you play?
9.    How many hours a week do you spend playing (not working) on MUDs?
10.   Where do you mud from? Home / Work / School
        List all that apply.

Thanks so much for your time!

Gretchen Shipman
