	           Recruiting Process
		
				
		ALL of the Four Elders that
		are deemed worthy of the spot
		that is appointed worthy to
		them by a Guild Wizard is 
		allowed to recruit. This is
		up to them if they assign a
		previous task to the person
		wishing to join or not. Once
		the recruit command is given
		this will hand the person
		being recruited a book of the
		ancient history of our roots.
		This book will also allow them
		to teleport to to the guild
		hall and this will start a 
		chain of trials for this person.
		The Master will require four
		marks, these marks will be
		given by the four elementalists
		that reside within our great
		halls. The NPCs will give a
		task/trial. Upon completion
		they will return to the same 
		NPC to turn in in the quest
		and recieve the mark from 
		that NPC and element. Once all
		four are done they will return
		to the Master in the main hall.
		He will hand them their anicent
		orb to join our ranks. These
		will be no easy tasks and this
		will not be for the weak of heart
		and mind so choose with the deepest
		of thought and be very wise.
