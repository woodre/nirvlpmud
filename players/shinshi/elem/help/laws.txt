		   Laws of the Elders
		
	 1. At all times, no matter the situation
	   always show respect to the guild Elders
	   and the guild wizard as well as fellow
	   guild members. (If there is an issue and
	   something you disagree with mail a guild
	   wizard or elder things will be handled
	   fair and properly.)
		    
         2. Do NOT PK your fellow guild members they
	   are your family. You need to support each
	   other. Support and look out for each other.
		      
	 3. No killing of newbies/pets/kids! NONE what
	   so ever there is no excuse for this and will
	   not be tolerated.
		    
         4. No Whining!
		    
	 5. Report all bugs or issues with the guild.
	   If caught abusing bugs you will be punished.
	   We need to keep things balanced and fair.
		    
	 6. Last and most important. Have FUN! Enjoy
	   Yourself and HAPPY HUNTING!.
