	          Elements of the Guild
		
	     The Elementalist guild consists of
	    powers that draw from the four 
	    Elements of the this realm. These
	    are Earth, Air, Water, and Fire.
	    This is where the Elders draw
	    their strength from as well as you.
	    Without the Elements we would not
	    exsist. Please view each one for
	    more specific info.
