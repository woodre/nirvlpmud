messages "GUild quests(oderus):**The TARRASQUE guild quest is pretty crazy.. its a TOUGH quest and you only get FEAR.. (and spy.. which is useless cause of the enhancer).**what I'm doing right now(deathmonger):**I'm rewriting the guild object to be compatible with the new onewe're (molasar/sandman/me) writing for paladins.  It's much more stable,with less fat and sodium.It should be up in the next week or two.**What I found OUT about Monks.(desade):**Hi,  Well I am an assassin again after my spying trip amongst the monks.It is absurd the type and number of new spells they are getting.They have speells to attack with MONEy instead of HPS/SPS.They have spells to steal energy WHILE they fight from teir opponents.There shield spell has only been toned down a little.They, get this, are planning a MINJA/PK wing of their guild with even MOREpowers aimed at PK-ing.Need I go on? This has gotten completely absurd.True not all levels get all those spells but all pasyts guild level 5 do.And get this, before they go on about the GREAT cost to get them, theyCAN SWAP OVERE EXPR THATW AS USED FOR EXTRA LEVELS AND STILL KEEP THEIREXTRA LEVELS> Is that a joke or what?So any old player at high extra levels strolls in, then gets AWESOME powersand GETS to keep ALL of the benefits of its extra levels. Its a bloddy joke.Oh, that was Ninja/PK wing I meant before. Feel replaced and scond rate or whatbrothers and sisters?Yours in Darkness,Desade.**poisons(deathmonger):**Yes, that's right poisons.  I've come up with a bunch of poisons and I'msoliciting you all for more ideas.  Keep them reasonable :).I have blindness, wander-to-church, slowness, cowardice...a couple othersso far.  Do post.Dm.PS the new guild will be up soon.  You'll be able to change yourappearance in very neat ways (using shadow(), if that means anything toyou). **Re: Hawkeye(deathmonger):**I didn't realize a wizard could be so emabarrassed by his work that he'd worryabout players 'spying' on his guild.  I had been looking at your code, butapparently you got paranoid about how I was pointing out serious bugs/cheatsso you locked me out of your dir.  No other wizard has put their guild intheir /closed dir so very few can read it.  That indicates to me you have something to hide.  That's pretty petty for a god to be that way.And what will ninja spells be?  And if they can't use monk spells, then theyaren't monks anymore and are therefore yet another guild, it would seem.In fact, what a most un-godlike message you wrote.  You feel obligated todemean the player who is reporting.  Why should you, a god, feel the needto discredit and flame a mere player in this way?  If Desade is wrong, thencorrection is in order, not petty flaming.Finally, the *main* reason for all this paranoia is you're embarrassed abouthow much code you stole from the various guilds.  The monks guild should becalled the "Borg" guild--assimilate the dopps, assassins, vamps, and whoknows what else in one guild.  I suspect that is the original reason yourestricted access to your code.Anyway, I have not been able to verify Desade's claims due to the lockingof yours and Pavlik's dirs.  What do you have to hide?  Why not put theguild in a dir accessible by lvl 40 wizs?Deathmonger.**laugh(hawkeye):**laugh, if you think sohawkre: desade, if he was reporting bugs id worry bout it, but the need to spy is crapno ones ever asked me to look at codeif i wanted it seen id post it in the churchevidently i dontleave it at thatoh, also, what do i have to hide...sm looks at my code as does boltar, anything wrong, im sure ill here aobut it :)**Re: laugh(deathmonger):**No, Sandman nor Boltar look at code unless someone sticks it in their face,as they have better things to do that police confused wizards, as they havesaid.  I'm sure you'll hear about it in the future however :):).The very idea that a god is worried about players 'spying' on 'his' guildis outrageously laughable.  What do you care?  I could care less if monkswere 'spying' in the assassins.  I think it would even help to get anobjective opinion.  Or critical even.Your explanation that "no one's ever asked me to look at the code" or thatyou'd "post it in the church" if you wanted everyone to look at it is100% choice bullshit.  See my previous message.Grade A, prime.Yes, you still must have something to hide.  You sound like FBI agentstrying to explain the video tape showing the M67 flamethrower tank burningdown the Branch Davidian compound.  More on that later :)All in all, your juvenile response speaks for itself.Smiley quota: :) :) :)Deathmonger.  Flibbity floo.**fbi(hawkeye):**actually, my dad is an FBI agent, and can get that tape if ya want itshows are at 7 and 9 every thurs nightas far as spying and my code, yeah i worry aobut it, its none of anyones business what the guilddoes unless they are in it, hey, just an opinionnlothing to hide, but it is pavliks and my code and we do what we want with itsee yahawk:):):).**wizards(deathmonger):**One of you generous wizards might want to do this:Make a system of tunnels underneath Nirvana with exits at strategic points.Entrances too.Dm.**working on portal room(catt):**   As I have time I am working on a room of portals and some other   ideas that may help the assassins. Unfortunately I don't have    much time to devote.      ->Catt, the busy one.**Hawkeye is full of it.(desade):**The only reason a GOD hides a guild from senior wizards is that the GODknows his guild is way outside all rules aand guidelines.  Hawkeye's whiney excuse "But it was approved by Boltar and Sandman" isbogus as hell. First look at ALL the cheats and bugs found AFTERit was"approved". Remember invunerable minshields? bless?  Next, hidden code is OFTEN changed AFTER approval. Hawkeye is hidinghis guild code because he KNOWS it violates all guidelines andhe doesn't want everyon on his case with specifics.What a poor whiney excuse for a god.**RE: whiny players(bismarck):** Hawkeye == God, so your little bitching on this board isn'tgoing to change a thing. Also, I have heard all this bitchingabout the monks, while at the same time look back on thedopps and say,'Man they kicked ass'. Hawk's guild is notanymore bs than they were, so live with it etc, etc, etc.Sorry for fillingup yer board dm, i just got bored andlove to bitch about anything i can find! WHEE-BisRoX**stuff(pavlik):** we cant fix the bugs til we know they are there....you can bitch and bitch and bitch about minshield, bless, whatever youwant...my case:1) is minshield still invuln?  NO2) is bless still even in the game    NO3) is there anything swinging between you legs beside your ego?   NO  -> to desade   -> from pavlik**You weasels.(deathmonger):**How come you guys are allowed to come in here an bitch on myguild board and I can't come in to yours?Deathmonger sees an inequity here.**Note removals(deathmonger):**How come a certain interesting stretch of notes between myself and Hawkeyewere removed?Deathmonger thinks you're trying to do that FBIspin control again.**FBI(hawkeye):**no shit, those were good notes, shrugumm..if ya dont want us in hereuse a query_ral_name() == hawkeye or pavlikmove_object(/room/church/)blah blah blah, you know how to cod ithawk**Re: Hawkeye(deathmonger):**Well, my point was not: ok, since you're dissing me, how about I dis you?It is: stop dissing me.Clear?PSSSSSSSS<--sounds like a snake sound.Dm.Or how about this one: disarmament, not arms race.**PKING(dracula):**This guild leaves something to be desired if you want to kill anyone else,I just got my ass whipped by a lev. 13 monky who was lev 2 in the guild.All assassin spells are useless against monks, we can't use backstab or harm.  I really hope this guild gets a little more power cause I like theIdea of a pking guild, we just need the tools to do it!!that's all for now I guess....Draculap.s. Seems like there are only wizes in this guild anyhow...*boggle***RE:PKING(dersharp):**The rules for this mudd designate that all guild spellscan NOT be used to pk other players.  Whether Dm will beable to get a few to work is improbable however the spellsthat ARE in this guild rock so use them well.				-Yeah so i just wanted to post here :)				-Dersharp**"
