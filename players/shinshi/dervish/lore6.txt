LORE OF THE DERVISH

Part 6:  Rules of the Sand

Once the whirling sands are fully embraced, I am your master.
Only those without power can embrace the sands.
You must walk naked through the world.
There can be no fear.
You must maintain the sands.
Your devotion to me will be rewarded with power.
Forsaking your duties to me will bring agonizing death.
