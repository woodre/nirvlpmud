DERVISH RULES

1) As your enlightenment grows, so must your exposure to the elements,
   that you may truly understand your place and feel your reality within
   the Sands.
2) You must be first in all battles, that none may question your devotion
   to selflessness.
3) You must lead a life of self-deprivation: physical strength and well-
   being are secondary to spiritual enlightenment.
4) You may choose to stop fighting an enemy, however, you may use no
   device to run from your enemies.
5) You will attain mystical powers with your enlightenment. With every
   expenditure of energy comes a requisite period of recuperative delay
   before you may reach again to the Sands.
6) The mystical energies may not be used to heal your flesh while in
   combat.
7) You must maintain the Sands - you may give of yourself or scatter
   the corpses of your enemies to the Sands.
