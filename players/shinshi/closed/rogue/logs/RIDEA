Jan 10 10:57  Kanji says: i think it would be better in some ways to have a higher combo roll than 5, because it makes it more challenging to get. getting 5 combo is pretty easy.
Jan 10 17:51  Kyrain says: should beable to see in the dark.
Jan 10 20:35  Jupis says: Guild is Fairly Fun. Has a bit of grinding....takes a while, dont like the no party object, but its understandable,. Tough, until you get the hang of it, then fairly mild..

Jan 14 14:55  Kanji says: the description for Ambush is basically the same as the emote i get when i backstab....kinda redundant and confusing about the difference between each.

Jan 22 10:30  Kyrain says: vanish should be after backstab insted of before.
Jan 24 07:13  Assassin says: How about, instead of making us use the rogue battle monitor, make combo points a useable variable in making our own custom battle monitor. There isn't nearly enough information for me in this one we're forced to look at :P.
Jan 24 07:58  Assassin says: also, why not make the guts and berries we get from dissecting corpses..... stackable ;).
Jan 24 10:32  Assassin says: ok Mr. Smart Guy :P how about another battle monitor variable for a poisoned weapon countdown timer ;).
Jan 24 10:42  Assassin says: another idea, maybe make the berries go into a "pouch" of some sort that's attached to the guild object, or make the pouch purchaseable from Drakniggacoochie dude, and the pouch will have its own special bagging commands for berries, pastes, and poisons.... like 'pouch <berries/paste/poison>', and unpouch with the same respect. have the item ID aligned with pouch but not bag, so it wouldn't be confused with the whole bag/bag 2 stuff..
Jan 25 08:58  Zek says: The stealth ability seems to function just like 'invisible' for a level 15 no guild player in the terms that i can't see my name in the score and the 'who' page still shows me on (at least to myself, not sure about others). I think it would be better if i could see my name at least, not sure how the 'who' page would work out but I don.
Jan 25 09:17  Zek says: 'apply instant to (weapon)' is better than 'apply instant posion to (weapon)'  i think, simpler.
Jan 25 10:53  Zek says: a title system would be cool.
Jan 25 11:11  Zek says: a spot in the monitor to tell us if we are stealth or not would be pretty cool.
Jan 25 12:21  Zek says: we shouldnt be able to stealth in combat, can basically stealth every round.
Jan 27 20:15  Zek says: a fatal would be nice, my mind goes to the word 'dispatch'.
Jan 28 12:25  Yesman says: brothers is broke as shit.
Jan 28 13:18  Zek says: another ability that uses combo points would be cool, mabey a hp.
Feb  8 21:23  Blind says: be able to stay in stealth while we fight.
Feb  9 11:49  Blind says: self sharpen our weps.
Feb  9 12:26  Jupis says: i dont like this bogusness.
Feb  9 12:27  Jupis says: how come ppl can steal my kills by assisting me? Wtf kinda bogusness is that.
Oct 21 14:19  Assassin says: we need an rbug command for a bug log :P I was fighting a lizardman guard. I first vanished. then shadowstepped him, then backstabbed. I hit expose next, then my first sin strike, and my heartbeat shut completely off, leaving him to attack me but me unable to fight back at all.
