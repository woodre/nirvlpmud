Fred fixed offhand so it actually does damage AND shows the messages
No more damage on not having PK set. Instead, it auto sets your PK
Rogues can now see in the dark
Backstab wasn't getting rid of the "didshadowstep" object. It's fixed.
Removed buying poisons
Made backstab, garrote, and sap autotargetable
Added DISSECT, berries, creating poisons, new rooms, etc.
Sstrike and Evis no longer work without a weapon
Made ambush, backstab, and sap a little easier to level
Stealth no longer costs sps
Rogues now have a WC increase (based on sstrike and evis)
