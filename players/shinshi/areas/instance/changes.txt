What is upperparts?  I'm not sure it's a word..
Should be "a reddish breast"
And don't put "you" in here either..  especially when I've been getting crap
     saying I favor certain people..  heh..  try "The sight of him is usually
     a sign that winter is on the way out."

mosquito.c
This looks ok.  I'm guessing you got that desc from a book or something..  *8)
That's absolutely fine btw.

sandworm.c
Same as the mosquito..  it's good

wasp.c
Smoky should be "smokey" which of course I'd catch since I'm married to him..  laff

Oh..  and if you got the bluebird desc from a book or a website, then upperparts
might well be a word dealing with birds that I wouldn't have heard.  But I didn't
find it on dictionary.com so you might wanna re-write it even if it is from a book.
Save yourself the trouble of people bein nasty about it later..  heh

No "you"..  not even the first would when it's a truth rather than an assumption.
I did ask about that after I let you use it in your first area, and I think it was
Fred who said not to use it at all.
I don't think "many different playground equipment" is right.  Maybe many different
types of playground equipment..  or pieces of playground equipment..
In the items, for equipment, make it "much more" not many
In the gym descs, I think just "jungle gym which children" is fine..  no "in" there
In the desc for sign..
     First of all, it's "forty"..  there's no u
     And just one little note, usually exa sign will give a player something like
        "It's a sign made of wood.  Maybe you should read it."  Then there's an
        add_action for read sign.  That's not a rule though, so I don't care if you
        change it.  Do what you want with the sign..  *8)
