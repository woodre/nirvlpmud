The general idea is you first go into this room, hear about this teacher's problem...
She was watching the kids when the kids suddenly ganged up on her
And stole her purse
When they took the purse, they took the objects out of the person and now each kid in the area has one
You can exchange those items for coins
Hence the directory name COINING :)

In outside5.c there is a command to 'climb ladder'
After you climb ladder, you can 'search treehouse' to find the actual purse.
However, the purse can only be found 1 time per area reset (which is shown in the code).
I know it's lame but it's my first area... The high school is going to be my MAJOR area :)
I promise... It'll be good :D
