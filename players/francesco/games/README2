MASTERMIND QUEST

The goal of the quest is to solve some mastermind games.

The player will be requested to solve two games
per every level of difficulty both for the colored
one and for the numbered one. Then the total number 
of games to solve will be 12. Two solutions are 
requested in order to minimize the effect of luck.

He will have to spend some money on the quest, so 
the bet must always be equal to the maximum allowed,
to let the solution be eligible for the quest. 
Thus, the minimum cost for the player will be:
(500+1000+2000)*2*2=14,000. Considering that 
there is about 1/3 of chance of solving a game,
the total average cost would be 40,000.

When the player will solve one game, he will
receive a hidden item (a counter?). When he will 
have 12 items, he will go to the gamemaster 
for the reward (something like the Ranger in 
Jurassic Park quest?). 
Question: the 12 items must be collected within 
one reboot or can they be stored?.

During the solution, the player has all his 
communication channels blocked, so he cannot 
get help from outside.

Proposed reward is the same than Hippo's, 
namely 9 qps.  (MC 9,  PC 0)
