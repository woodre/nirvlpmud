At first, you find yourself having trouble adjusting to the curvature of 
the floor, which slopes gently down from all sides of the room, finally 
evening out to a small, flat disc-like platform at the center of the room.  
However, after only a few moments in this dazzling wonderland, traversing 
this space begins to seem more natural than any other motion you've ever 
experienced.  Light, shattered, reflected, and refracted from thousands 
of varying angles by the numerous mirrors that line the upwardly sloping 
walls, dazzles you with its brilliance.  The room is awhirl with colors, 
blazing from every direction, hues of everything and everyone around you 
intensified by the silvered-glass walls.  You sense the room, and for all 
you know, all creation, revolving around you.  This place seems a place 
of dreams, this spherical room, a world within a world.  This is a place 
of peace, of purity...an ever-changing kaleidoscopic sanctum where only 
"now" matters.
