The kaleidoscope is an area made by 50 rooms which all have the
same description but with different shapes and colors. The exits
are fully randomized.  

There is an entrance room which details the features of the area.

Monsters
Also the monsters have the same description, but all of them are
differently shaped and colored. Also, their emotes during the fights 
are always different. 
The monsters will be cloned with a 1/5 chance.
The cloned monster will be of lev 18, 19 or 20 (1/3rd chance each).
Five rooms could clone two monsters at the same time.
Therefore the average number of monsters cloned would be 12 per reset.

Items
The monster will only carry a kaleidoscope, which can be turned into
an immediate heal, or used to buy a set of heals, or cashed, at
player's best choice.
Differently worth kaleidoscopes are cloned according to monster's level.

Is all, thank you.
