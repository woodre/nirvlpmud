The theme of the quest is the graduation in Mechanical Engineering.
Thus, the player needs to study all the subjects of the curriculum.
Then he goes into the University library and wanders around the various 
shelves over there.  The descriptions are written in both english and 
italian, corresponding to each other.  A voice makes a simple question,
i.e. "What is the english translation of ....?".  The player has to type
"answer ....".  If it is correct, then a bookworm of the library is 
cloned and the player must kill it.  When the bookworm dies, a book is 
cloned which is corresponding to the subject of that room,  i.e. 
chemistry -> chemistry, applied mechanics -> applied mechanics and so on.
The player can now grab the book and then move back and enter a new shelf, 
with a new subject .... and so on until he has done all the subjects and 
got the corresponding credits.  Now he can go back to the librarian and 
put the books on her desk. She will then give him a diploma and then 
later the dean will give him the final degree.  The quest is solved.

 
Solution

 1  goto Marian in the library of the University.
 2  show id          (moves to front_library)
 3  go forward       (moves to back_library)
 4  wander <subject) (moves to the selected shelf)
 5  answer <answer>  (if the answer is correct, it clones the bookworm)
 6  kill bookworm    (clones an invisible monster to grab a book)
 7  grab book        (clones the book to player's inventory)
 8  go back          (moves to back_library)
 9  <repeat step 4 through 8 for getting the 21 books needed>
10  back             (moves back to front_library)
11  head back        (moves back to the librarian)
12  put book on desk (destructs one book and increments the counter)
13  <repeat step 12 for the 21 books>
14  apply for degree (clones a certificate to player's inventory)
15  w,n,n,nw         (moves to the dean for the final graduation ceremony)
16  graduate         (clones a diploma to player's inventory and
                      adds the quest points)


Comments and features

The rooms are NT and no exits.

The quest can be entered only once per reboot and when the player exits
the quest he cannot re-enter.  Thus, he has to carry all the heals 
needed to solve it.

There will be 21 rooms, corresponding to the general subjects of a
bachelor degree in mechanical engineering.

Each room will have about 5 different questions to be made, randomized. 
The player must answer only to the one proposed.

The bookworms are cloned of a level close to the level of the player so
that the quest could be solved at any level.  Their wc is decreased 
and their ac is increased, making them weaker and more difficult to 
be hit.  The wc decrease is less than the ac increase, according to 
the monster.guide file.

Each book has a value corresponding to the level of the bookworm killed 
and can be cashed at the librarian by typing "return book".  Of course
in this case the player will get the coins but not the credits.
If he decides go for the quest, then he has to put all the books on
the desk and apply for the degree. All books will be destructed.
A complimentary prize will be rewarded.  


Cheat sheets

It would be possible to share all the 120 randomized answers to the 
questions, yet the player will still need to kill all the bookworms 
to get the books.

Final comment

The area can be used for plain exp/coins purposes. Should this quest
not be accepted, it will just be my second area, upon approval.
