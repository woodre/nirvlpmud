A trip along the streets of Roma which will allow to see
how it was in the past, in the Middle Age and how it is now.

The past is shown by the Coliseum, the Senate, the Arch of 
Constantine, the Traiano's Mall.
The Middle Age is shown by some beatiful fountains and places
and by St. Peter Cathedral.
The present is shown by a modern quarter of the city and by the
backbone of the area, full of tourists.


The general layout is shown in MAP_OF_ROMA

Monsters, items, special features still to be decided.


thank you
