The fountain was built by the architect Salvi (1735) in the time of Clement XII, 
and decorated by several artists of Bernini's school. It is the front of a large 
palace (Palazzo Poli) decorated with statues and bas-reliefs on heaps of rocks.
The fountain is not only celebrated for its excellent water but for the legend 
that whoever drinks it or throws a coin in the fountain, will assure his return to Rome.
