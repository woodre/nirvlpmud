Fran's comments on Tristian's new area named Club_Fed

/players/tristian/realms/ClubFed/

Start 	in castle.c it is written start.c should turn to be Start.c
	your -> the
	box -> there is no box here
	tables -> there is no tables here
	after the sentence ‘The bailiff comes over....blah blah blah,” 
	  there should be something which says that the player had been 
	  moved somewhere, likely “You are escorted to a cell, whose 
	  door loudly shuts behind your back”
        "Strangely enough there is no sound in this room." Why is it strange?

court   "Strangely enough there is no sound in this room." Why is it strange?


Cell_B_10 sealy "A Sealy Posturpedic mattress, probably better 
                than you current sleep on"
	        Do you have paranormal powers and can guess that
		MY OWN bed is less confortable than this one???
	  thier -> their
	  Its -> It is
          bathroom -> there is no bathroom here

hall_B_01     door -> there is no door here
              wall -> there is no wall here
              the message about the lock/unlock is wrong.
              should be "The door is already unlocked"
NOTE: this apply to all hall_B  01-09

hall_B_10     I would strongly advice to put some warning about
              what would happen if you go 'e'.  We strongly
              discourage to be insta killed just cuz in the
              next room there is an aggro lev 22 mob.
              Note: this apply also to hall_A_10

hall_B_shower "The con drops the soap". I am supposed to be
              able to look at soap after that. Also, how many
              soaps is he carrying?  LOL
              Note: this apply also to hall_A_shower

hall_A_01     door -> there is no door here
              wall -> there is no wall here
              the message about the lock/unlock is wrong.
              should be "The door is already unlocked"
NOTE: this apply to all hall A  01-09


crack   use a different message than heroin when convulsioning

key     "The key to open the cell doors". This is not the description
        of the key, but it is the description of what it does.
        I would prefer: 
        "The key is large and heavy, it seems it could somehow 
        fit in the cells locks"

cig     the cig must be in player's inventory to be used

guard   why is the guard spraying me with pepper? I just called

Jimmi Tedeschi  should be lookable also by "look at tedeschi"
                again, his description doesnt describe the guy
                but describes why he was jailed. if you still want
                to show players why he was jailed, this could be the way:
                "Jimmy tedeschi is a tall man, in his mid 50's,
                wearing a yellow prison uniform, typical of those
                who defrauded the government"
                Alternatively, you could put a sign in the prison lobby
                or wherever which reports all the colors of the 
                uniforms used in the prison and the corresponding 
                penalty.

General comment about the mobs: i would suggest to modify their power according
                                to some scale of power, eventually related
                                to the power of their crime. Connected to what
                                i posted above, this would lead to a better
                                recognizement of the mobs. I wouldnt like
                                to see and to kill the same mob over and over.
                                Make them somehow different is the advice.

General comment on the items: they are ok

General comment about the area: it is a bit repetitive, but this fit well
                                with the environment..... what is more
                                repetitive and boring than a prison?
                                The layout is well organized, so are the mobs
                                (provided the previous changes are made)
