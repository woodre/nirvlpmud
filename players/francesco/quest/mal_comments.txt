Ok, this is the first round of changes.  Get this done and then let
me know when you are finished and I will go over it all one last
time.

front_library.c  -  The entrance and exits are not clearly shown.  
                    I couldn't figure
                    out on my own that 'go' and 'come' were the
                    commands.

back_library.c  - add item descriptions for mouse and screen. In the
                  long():
                  Known the book or the subject = Knowing the book or
                  the subject
                  also:
                  is possible to wander around the shelves = 
                  is possible to 'wander' around the shelves
                  (There are several keywords to this area to make things
                   work, and making them easier to know is good.  The quest
                   shouldn't be hard because people don't know where to
                   start or what to do, but instead because it is hard to

                   answer the questions.)

All Rooms -  Change Tag description: It might be useful to reading it = 
             It might be useful to read it
             Ok, the description says that there is a button that you
             can 'push to lift', but the command is 'lift'. Then, when
             I do the command lift, the function isn't there. Fix this.
             When I need to answer the question, I don't know that I need
             to 'whisper' it...instead i tried to say it. Make this more
             clear.
 "   Found the right direction to get to the geometry area of the\n"+
 "library,  you are now in an aisle,  surrounded on both sides\n"+
 "by metallic shelves,  holding several books.  A tag is suspended\n"+
 "on the left shelf.\n", would look better as:
 "   You enter the geometry area of the library.  This is an aisle\n"+
 "that is surrounded on both sides by metallic shelves.  On these\n"+
 "shelves are several books.  A tag is suspended on the left shelf.\n"

             Read tag - change it to read: Not only does it analyze the 
             single processes

physics.c:
             Read tag - Phisics = Physics

fluid_dynamics.c:
             Read tag - you have a double 'they'

engines.c : 
             Read tag - you have a double 'and' towards the end of it.
