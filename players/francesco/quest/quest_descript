THEME

The theme of the quest is the graduation in Mechanical Engineering.
Thus, the player needs to study all the subjects of the curriculum.
Then he goes into the University library and wanders around the various 
shelves over there.  The librarian asks for help about an italian word.
A tag is suspended on the shelves which might help to make the italian 
-> english translation.  The player has to type  "whisper ....".  If it 
is correct, then a bookworm of the library is cloned and the player must 
kill it.  When the bookworm dies, a book is cloned which is corresponding 
to the subject of that room,  i.e. chemistry -> chemistry, applied 
mechanics -> applied mechanics and so on. The player can now grab the 
book and then move back and enter a new shelf, with a new subject .... 
and so on until he has done all the subjects and got the corresponding 
credits.  Now he can go back to the librarian and put the books on her 
desk. She will then give him a diploma and then later the dean will give 
him the final degree.  The quest is solved.

COMMENTS AND FEATURES

The rooms are NT and no exits.  Also, there is an invis object in the
room which makes people unable to communicate to other players.  They
cant get hint nor advices while questing.

The quest can be entered only once per reboot and when the player exits
the area, he cannot re-enter.  Thus, he has to carry all the heals 
needed to solve it.

There will be 21 rooms, corresponding to the general subjects of a
bachelor degree in mechanical engineering.

Each room will have about 5 different questions to be made, randomized. 
The player must answer only to the one proposed.

The bookworms are cloned of a level close to the level of the player so
that the quest could be solved at any level.  Their wc is increased 
and their ac is decreased, making them stronger than usual.  The wc
increase is more than the ac decrease, according to the monster.guide 
file.  Further, for players of lev 19, it might clone a 750 hps mob.

Each book has a value corresponding to the level of the bookworm killed 
and can be cashed at the librarian by typing "return book".  Of course
in this case the player will get the coins but not the credits.
If he decides to go for the quest, then he has to put all the books on
the desk and apply for the degree. All books will be destructed.
A complimentary prize will be rewarded.  


CHEAT SHEETS

It would be possible to share all the 120 randomized answers to the 
questions, yet the player will still need to kill all the bookworms 
to get the books.
