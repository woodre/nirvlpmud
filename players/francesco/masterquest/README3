FINALS QUEST


THEME
The goal of the quest is to login into Fran's
computer to get in advance the solutions of the finals.
The player then must find the userid and the password of
that computer to have access to it.  To do this, he/she
must solve two mastermind games, one gives the userid,
the other gives the password.  The player is caught when
he tries to steal the info and then must fight for his/her
life.  After killing two students he will use the userid 
and the password to snoop into Fran's computer. 


SOLUTION
1: goto Fran and listen to him.
2. goto his labs.
3: sneak into his machining lab.
4: solve one mastermind game.
5: kill the student which is cloned.
6: sneak into his foundry lab.
7: solve another mastermind game.
8: kill the other student.
9: goto Fran's computer.
10: type the userid and the password.
The quest is solved.

Note: steps 3 and 6 can be made in any order


HINT
Login into Fran's computer and steal his data.


COMMENTS
The player must solve two mastermind games, 
one numbered and one colored, at level tough.
This could give MC 9.
The player must also kill Fran (easy, optional) and two 
students (tough) to save his/her life.
This could give PC 4.
The quest is not cheatable because the solutions
to the mastermind are always different.
Also, the player must kill the guards alone, 
without any help, in no teleport rooms.
