DESCRIPTION:
-------------
The Meijin are perfectionists.  Once a Meijin reaches guild
rank 20, he must select a sigle type of weapon (ie: sword,
dagger, mace, etc.)  The player then seeks to master that
particular type of weapon.  He will only be able to wield
weapons of that type.  All guild stats and skills are based
on weapon combat.  Meijin have very limited magical abilities.

Meijin have Endurance Points, rather than spell points.
Combat and Skills cost the Player endurance points, which
can only be recovered by resting (non-combat).


-------------
GUILD RANKS:
-------------
The Meijin has limitless guild ranks.  The cost for ranks
rises exponentially.  By design the Player should achieve
maximum skills/stats around guild rank 127.

Rank cost is determined by an (obtuse) equation.  To see how
much guild ranks cost, please clone a guild object (~/guild/gob.c)
and type 'xlevelcost <#>' where # is a guild rank.  You can
view a range of ranks by typing 'xlevelcost <#1> <#2>'.

-------------
GUILD STATS:
-------------
Meijin have specific guild stats that affect how well there combat and
skill abilities work.  Guild stats can be increased by training, using
the practice sessions that are gained when the player advanced in rank.
Guild Stats and skills are raised 3 + random(8) points reach time they
are practiced.
All skills and stats start at 0 and max at 100.


-----------
PRACTICES:
-----------
Guild Members use practice sessions to raise guild stats and skills.
Practice sessions are given when the player advanced in guild rank.
Practice sessions are awarded in the following manner:
	Ranks 1-10:	1 practice session per advance
	Ranks 11+ :	1 + random(4) sessions per advance

Extensive play-testing has yielded the following information:
   Average # of Practices gained per level:        2.4
   (%) Increase of skill/stat per practice:        8.2
   Practices needed to Max skill or stat:          12.2    (100 / 8.2)
   Practices needed to Max ALL skills and stats:   305     (22 * 12.2)
   Number of levels required to do so:             127     (305 / 2.4)
   Guild Experience Cost for Rank 127:		   14,776,266

ENDURANCE:
-----------
--- The endurance system has been changed and this documentation
--- has yet to be updated.  refer to gob.c and combat.h for endurance
--- information.

ADVANTAGES:
------------
   (1) DAMAGE BONUS:
	Meijin get a bonus to weapon-inflicted damage.  The
	damage bonus is calculated by using the players 
	weapon_type skill and strength and agility stats.

   (2) CRITICAL HITS:
	Critical hits multiple the damage bonus.  Critical hits also
	drain the Players endurance.  Critical hits are not possible
	against other players (PK).

   (3) OFFWIELDING:
	When the Meijin reaches guild rank 40 he can gain the ability
	to offwield weapons (wield 2 weapons at the same time).  Many
	guild skills and abilities are not avaliable when the Player
	is offwielding.  Damage Bonuses and Critical Hits (see above)
	are not possible when Offwielding.

   (4) PARRYING
	Parrying is a very high level skill that allows the Meijin to
	use his second weapon to "block" opponents attacks.  Parry uses
	the old Paladin code to increase the players AC.

   (5) INCREASED STAMINA:
	Meijin have a max Stamina of 24.

---------------
DISADVANTAGES:
---------------
   (1) CAN ONLY WIELD ONE WEAPON TYPE:
	Once the Meijin reaches guild rank 25 he must select one type
	of weapon to wield.  His goal is to perfect or master that
	type of weapon.  If and when the Player maxes the weapon stat (100%)
	he may select a second weapon type.

   (2) LIMITED ARMOR:
	The Meijin can armor wear armor types: Armor, Helmet and Boot.

   (3) LIMITED MONEY:
	The Meijin can only carry 50,000 coins at one time.

  *(4) LOSE EXPIERENCE FOR LEAVING A FIGHT:
	-This is still under construction-, but the basic concept is that the
	player would lose guild XP for leaving a fight while the opponent
	still lives.  See file 'shadow.c' for more on this.

   (5) NO AUTOMATIC WIMPY:
	Meijin cannot automatically wimpy from a fight.  This is quite a
	disadvantage to the player, especially in *lag*.

   (6) LIMITED SPELL ABILITY:
	Meijin's cannot use the sonic spell.  Sonic is obviously the most
	powerful mud-based spell and not having it avaliable makes a big
	difference, specially in PK combat.

   (7) REDUCED MAGIC APTITUDE:
	Meijin have a max Magic Aptitude of 14.  This more than offsets the
	+4 Stamina points listed above as an advantage.  This is not such a
	big disadvantage since the player has little need for spell points,
	however I believe it will make a difference.

--------------------------------------------------
MISC STUFF THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO FIT ANYWHERE ELSE
--------------------------------------------------
At guild rank 30 guild members get a "private room" within the guild hall.
This room has the ability to store 1 saveable item.  The room file is:
/players/vertebraker/guilds/meijin/room/personal_room.c

The guild has a "guild vault" that they can place items and money in.  The
money total saves through reboots, but the items do not.  Players can access
the vault remotely after attaining the proper guild rank (see powers/xvault.c)

The guild pet is a special case.  The stats on the guild pet ~can~ exceed
those specified in /doc/build/RULES/pets if the player invests enough
experience in having the pet trained.  Again the experience cost to train
to pet is rather obtuse, please refer to: ~/guild/npc/kitaeru.c for the
functions used to determine the cost.  When the pet is trained to maximum
amounts it will have the following stats:
max hp: 200  (50 + stamina*3) [stamina max=50]
max wc: 17   ( 2 + attack/4)  [attack max=60]
max ac: 12   ( 0 + defense/4) [defense max=60]

The pertinent guild pet files are:
/players/vertebraker/guilds/meijin/obj/guild_pet.c
/players/vertebraker/guilds/meijin/pet-daemon.c
/players/vertebraker/guilds/meijin/npc/kitaeru.c
