This file contains thoughts and notes on the Endurance Point system
for the Meijin guild.

-------------------------------
Endurance Point Recovery Rate:
-------------------------------
Endurance Points recover once every 5 heart_beats.  The amount of
points recovered is equal to Constitution/10.  Thus the max
recovery rate is 10.  Endurance Points recover at at least a
rate of 2 every 5 hb.

At the maximum recovery rate the Endurance Point to Spell Point
recovery ratio is 10:1

I will try to use the 10:1 recovery ratio to justify how EPs
can compare to SPs.

----------------------
Max Endurance Points:
----------------------
The maximum Endurance Points avaliable to a player is calculated
in the following manner:
  max_ep = 200 + (endurance_stat * 5) + (guild_rank * 7)/2

The above calculates to 1244 points assuming max guild rank (127)
and max endurance_stat (100).

If we assume to 10:1 EP to SP ratio, the player only has 1/3rd the
amount of endurance avaliable compared to the equivilent max number
of spell points (353 for a 19+21 level player with magic aptitude of 20).

---------------------------------
Endurance Point costs in Combat:
---------------------------------
Cost for wielding a single weapon : 6  EPs per hb (30 every 5 hb)
Cost for wielding two weapons     : 8  EPs per hb (40 every 5 hb)
Cost for two weapons & parry mode : 10 EPs per hb (50 every 5 hb)

Assuming the max EP recovery rate it will cost the player:
4 EPs per hb for wielding a single weapon (30-10)/5
6 EPs per hb for wielding two weapons (40-10)/5
8 EPs per hb for wielding two weapons & parry mode (50-10)/5

----------------------------------
Endurance Point costs for Skills:
----------------------------------
Spells/Skills will have a cost equivilent to the SP cost * 7.  So
a spell that would cost 25 SPs will cost 175 EPs.  The EP to SP cost
ratio is 7:1

---------------------
Comparing EPs to SPs
---------------------
Although the EP to SP recovery ratio is 10:1, the EP to SP cost ratio
is only 7:1.  The major differences between EPs and Sp are:
  only 1/3rd of total possible EPs compared to the equiv. SPs
  there are no heals to recover EPs like there are for SPs
