messages "Thu Jul 	 | Welcome (Pavlik):**Weclome All to the Meijin Guild!  The guild is currently open in"beta" mode, which means membership is limited to 10 playersand all the bugs _might_ not be ironed out of the code yet.  Ifyou notice anything that doesn't seem right please let me knowASAP.  As always, if you have questions, comments, suggestions,etc please feel free to share those too.  Use this board ismuch as possible so that all the members can put in their say.     Pav**Thu Jul 	 | guild ranks (Pavlik):**just so that you all know, the first 10 guild ranks are what areconsidered 'apprentice' ranks.  you will only gain 1 practice per rankand no new skills until you get past guild rank 10.enjoy,   Pav**Thu Dec 24	 | Vault (Tragedy):**hmph - i've pumped in the 25k for donations and it restarted me @ 0 in the vault - is this normal??  And do I still get bonuses for having donated so much stuff?Thanks,T**Tue Dec 29	 | Donations (Pavlik):**I have to check on the status of Donation Points.  I believe this is not quitefinished yet and I know there are no bonuses being given for donation leadersat this time.  I'm playing with an idea of bonuses to Stats for donationleaders but haven't quite worked it out yet.Please don't let that stop you from depositing useful equipment and items intothe guild vault that may help your brothers and sisters.Thanks,	Pav**Wed Dec 30	 | Important Change (Pavlik):**Meijin now select their weapon of choice at guild rank *20*, not 30.This will allow guild members to start benefitting from special combatbonuses a little bit sooner then before.The approximate cost for guild rank 20 is 200000 xp.enjoy,	Pav**Thu Dec 31	 | blah (Tragedy):**silly...i already selected my wep at 30..hehthat prolly woulda helped*whine*T**Sat Jan 	 | re:blah (Pavlik):**that's the life of a beta-tester.suck it up.  :)P**Sat Jan 	 | Coins limit (Pavlik):**This doesn't seem to be anywhere obvious in the guild docs, but this isa reminder that Meijin may only carry a Max of 50,000 coins.  If youpick up more than 50k it will automatically be converted into donationpointsThanks,	Pav**Thu Jan 21	 | New Skills! (Pavlik):**Read:xhelp vaultxhelp xallyMake sure you take notice of the guild rankrequirement for these skills.Pav**Thu Jan 21	 | Donations (Pavlik):***Hurrah* ... the donation maximum has been dropped to 65k.Thats 65k and you earn an extra practice session!Penny saved, Penny earned.**Thu Jan 28	 | Guild Status (Pavlik):**1/27/99:Boltar has closed the guild because of "additional unapproved guild".What Boltar failed to notice was that the additional code is notavaliable to you as players and is only avaliable to me and my test chars.Despite having this explained to him Boltar insists that Pain (our approvalsenior wizard) must re-review the guild code before the Meijin can havetheir guild objects replaced.I apologize severly for this and hope we will be back up soon.Pavlik**"
