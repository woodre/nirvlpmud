6/19:	Added skill_actions array to keep track of all the add actions.
	This keeps the guild object from having to rescan the powers directory
	everytime it is moved to the player.

6/19:	Add query_ghost check to the pet.  The guild pet will move to the
	storage room and dest itself when the player dies.

6/19:   Updated the README file some.  Basically just expanded on the information
	already there.  Added a new item under Disadvantages.

6/19:   Added 'xdonators' command to list players ranked by donation points.  Also
        removed the current donator bonuses.  I plan to redo that a little better.

6/20:   Added a way for the player to manually stop raging.  It costs an addt'l 10 EPs
	to do this, but will allow the player to get control again.

6/21:   Upped the maximum endurance (changed from [30+(END*5/2)] to [30+(END*3)].
	Extensive playtesting by both Beck and Myself revealed that even under
	conservative methods, EP levels were too low.

6/21:   Added player check in the critical of combat.h  Critical hits are not possible
	when fighting another player, however offwielding and combat bonuses still apply.
	Made notes in README to reflect this as well.

6/22:	Added money limit so that guild members cannot have more than 50k coins.

6/25:   Changed the EP total once more, still looking for just the right mix.  Added
	guild rank into the equation this time, think that will work out well.

6/26:   Add is_pet(){ return 1; } to guild_pet.c  Not having it there was an oversight
	on my part.

6/30:   Changed obj/corpse_bag.c so that it handles weight properly.  Bag now adds 1/8
	the weight of its contents to the player, as outlined in /doc/build/RULES/bags

7/1:    Added money cost to xsummon (guild_pet).  It now costs 1800 coins to summon
	the guild pet.

7/1:    Added some additional doc about the guild pet to README.  I believe the guild pet
	to be a special case because of the amount of experience needed to train the pet.
	This is in regards to what Boltar refers in /doc/build/RULES/pets when comparing
	guild pets to mud kids.

7/2:    Making major changes to the xrage skill.  Will document more when done.

7/2:	Correct xcripple to conform to guidlines set in /doc/build/RULES/stat_alter.  Stat
	reduction cannot excede 25% of WC or 33% of AC.  Monster recovers stats after a
	period of time (recovery is much quicker if the player is not present).

7/2:	Teleport error added to xportal

7/6:	Changed the numbers on the bind skill.  Trying to make sure this healing capability
	stays legal and cannot be abused by players.

7/7:	Yet another major re-work of the endurance point system.  I *really* think I got it
	down this time so that EPs compare well to SPs.  Please read the file EP_README
	for more information.

7/8:	Changes the combat_beat() damage to spell_object.  weapon bonuses are now added by
	using set_spell_dam().  rage_beat() still uses hit_player.  Because of this I also
	have to change the damage for xkick and xstrike to hit_player, so that there are
	not two calls to spell_object in the same heart_beat.

7/9:	Updated the all skill costs to reflect the changes made in EP_README.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1/4:	Upped endurance base from 200 to 300.  Going on the 7:1 spell point to endurance point
	ration, the guild member starts with the equivelent of ~40 spell points.

?  :	Added dexterity check to offwield function.  Offwield weapon class cannot excede the
	(dexterity/10 + weapon_skill/10)

?  :	Added type "amulet" to armor types that guild members are allowed to wield.  Without
	being allowed to wimpy the player might need some help standing toe-to-toe.

?  :	Xally command added.  Allows guild members to make Allies of non-Meijin players.  Allies
	can talk on the guild channel and read basic help files.
	created ~/guild/ally_gob.c for allies and modified xt and xwho commands.

?  :	Xamine command added.  Allows the player to determine what the set_type of a weapon is.
	Finding out that there are ALOT of weapons on the mud without set_type.

?  :	Xmeditate command tested and proposed for guild addition.  Pain turned it down for reason
	that one of the guild disadvantages is not to be able to recover endurance points quickly.

?  :	Xparry command changed code somewhat to allow for different defense modes.  No changes made
	that will affect players.

?  :	Xtumble command added for testing.  This is a weaker version of the parry skill.  Required
	updates to combat.h and gob.c  Not avaliable to players.

?  :	Xrage tweaking.  Still trying to determine the best course for Xrage.  Does not affect players
	since it will be quit awhile until they are high enough level to get xrage.  Need to have the
	skill reapproved once tweaking is done.

?  :	Xvault command added.  Will allow players to put/get into the guild vault remotely.  Does
	not work in realm() "NT" or "NM" areas.  Not currently avaliable to players.

?  :	Updates to gob.c to clean up some of the misc. messiness in the code.  Cleaned up mapping code
	to remove old mapping variables when not being used any more.

?  :	Updates to combat.h -> RAISED critical costs by minor amounts.  These seemed to be a little
	low after more play testing.  Also changed combat.h to allow for the tumble skill (this change
	does not affect players)

?  :	ally_gob.c object added for allies.

?  :	defs.h tweaked.  Added some more defines to make coding a little easier.

2/1:	Added a query_ghost check to the xregister command, so that the player cannot reset
	themselves while dead.

2/1:	Added query_meijin_master(){ return 1; } to guild NPCs for future code possibilities

2/4:	Added guild move function to guild rooms that allows the player to teleport from room
	to room within the guild hall.  See: ~/guild/room/room.h
