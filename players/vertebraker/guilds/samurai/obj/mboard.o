There will no tolerance for anyviolations of the Bushido Code.  Therefore,  I expect nothingbut the best from you all.The Bushido code on respect -  There is a gray area and respect is important.  I expect the enemy to always recieve their corpses back  with their gear.  This shows a great deal amount of respect  for the enemy. So we can battle the enemy once again with honor.  If the enemy does disrespect a Samurai, then that Samurai has the  right to defend their honor. If a Samurai brings shame to their  self, then that Samurai will recieve shame for their actions.  Shame is not giving back corpses, disrespecting other Samurai,  helping those who are evil, not speaking the truth,  engaging in deceitful activities, or not following the Bushido code.   The word Samurai is meant to serve.  Serve the code,  serve the Shoguns, and the Emperor.  If you think a Samurai  made a bad decision, then let the Emperor or LT Shoguns know.  The code outlines everything.  Never bring any shame to the name  of the Samurai.  Follow the code and we cannot falter.  **guild lockers(vertebraker):**There are guild lockers u, w from here.You can store an amount of items equivalent to your rank.**guild is open(vertebraker):**THIS GUILD IS OPEN. FEEL FREE TO SET PK.**changes(vertebraker):**iaijitsu/bladestorm have a chance of cutting you whenyou use them, based on a dex roll.kenjutsu has been wimped by about 20%.diminished a bit of the WC bonuses.**guild(vertebraker):**Guild is back in beta due to administrative difficulties.Sorry, no PK until further notice.**musashi(vertebraker):**Musashi is available to fight for a full suit of Samuraiarmor. See the armory.**samurai armor(vertebraker):**Each piece of the Samurai armor is relatively weak.But when they are combined, .. well, I'll letthe code speak for itself.**back open(vertebraker):**back open. enjoy.**New Samurai(valen):**In order to reach the rank 1.  You learn and live the Bushido code at all times.  All the other information posted here is good to know as well.  You must know the layout of the guild and how to advance in guild rank.  You should know what happens to those that break the code and what happens if you fail to advance the guild rank.  What objects you cannot use in sparring Pai Mei.  Follow the Bushido code and you cannot falter.  Never bring shame to the name of the Samurai.Valen, Emperor**stun/rend(vertebraker):**Stun and Rend no longer work in PK.**samurai(vertebraker):**samurai can't raise their stealth past 20..**iaijitsu/bladestorm(vertebraker):**I raised Bladestorm's cost to 80.Iaijitsu and Bladestorm now work off of magical damage.**kenjutsu(vertebraker):**Kenjutsu now hits with a "magical" damage type.**iaijitsu/bladestorm(vertebraker):**Iaijitsu and Bladestorm now function a bit differently...Not going to say what the change is, but it's not thatmassive.**Emperor's Note's(valen):**Shoguns:Every Shogun has proven they are mighty warriors and the Emperor will listen to them. Every Samurai will do the biddings of the Shoguns and Emperor.  There are no LT Shoguns and only one Emperor. If any issues should arise, then the Shoguns and Emperor should be mailed. If you attain the rank Shogun, then let me know.On Recruiting:The way of the Samurai is following the bushido code.  What we look for in a recruit is someone to follow the Bushido code without question.  The recruit will do the biddings of any Shogun and the Emperor.  All potential recruits for the Samurai must be level 15 from now on.  Once the Shoguns believe the recruit has what it takes, then the recruit will be invited into the Samurai.   The only way to get promoted to Samurai rank 1 is for the recruit to demonstrate his/her knowledge of the Bushido code and pass any trials given by the Shoguns and the Emperor.On PK:The greatest honor is to die in combat in service to the Bushido code.  Setting your pk to fight in battle is what very glorious Samurai desires.  The thrill of the fight and the experience of combat. Once you obtain the rank Shogun.  There is nothing holding you back!  It is strongly encourage to set your pk at this time and join the rest of the honorable Samurai in combat with the enemy.  If you die in combat and you lose all your gear, then find new gear and restore your honor by slaying your foes.  If you are jumped in combat and you are not ready for the fight, then leave and grab what you need to fight the enemies of the Samurai.  Nothing more glorious then dying in combat!On Clans:All Samurai are encouraged to join the Yamato Clan.  The Yamato Clan follows the same principles of the Bushido code.  The advantages are public coins and personal locker systems.  Also with public storage for anyone to take or put into.  If any member of the Yamato clan breaks the Bushido code.  Then let a Shogun or the Emperor know ASAP. For recruitment into the Yamato Clan ask a Shogun or the Emperor.Follow the Bushido Code and we cannot falter.Valen, The Emperor**Shame(valen):**I will shame anyone for thier actions that are not following the Bushido code.  This includes smack talking, killing mudkids/pets, etc...  When it comes to right and wrong, there is no grey area.  Always do the right thing.Valen, Emperor**Changes pretty much complete.(earwax):**I've pretty much finalized my changes to the guild.  I've loweredboth offense and defense.  In your offensive mode, you will nolonger get the defensive bonuses you still were getting before, andvice versa.  For any who feel this is bullshit, you need to understandthat from my point of view it is complete and total bullshit thatnobody was reporting how overpowered this guild was.  This guild had,before my tender affectionate attention to it, by FAR the most offense,indeed, significantly more than dervish.  On top of that, whereDervs have 0 defense at all, literally, this guild had the highestdefense in the game by far.  I can't see how anyone can't noticeexactly how bs that is.  Bullshit is a +22 running through the museumwith a minimal of heals time after time.  Bullshit is blowing throughshit like it's nothing and then complaining because someone catcheson and fixes it.  Bullshit is what I'm going to do to anyone gripingto me on this, because my patience is very very thin with this guildright now.-Earwax**26(vertebraker):**I removed the "self-cutting" chance on iaijitsu and bladestorm.Bladestorm costs 240 sp. That's probably WAY too much.But we still have to finalize "area-effect" spells.**PK(chant):**Ok so I wanted to pk a ranger tonight then I had the quandary  to pk him Honorably.  He was like you cant cause its a good guildI was like well I would have bowed first and not just jump youso I didn't and want to know what the correct course was.**RE: PK(chant)(jacob):**We generally try to stay on good terms with Rangers, being as your Emperor as well as a few otherSamurai are allied to the Power Rangers. We aren't so much a "good" guild as we follow our own moralstandards and values, but I would prefer that we stay on good terms with Rangers and the KnightsTemplar, as like I said, myself and a few others are allied to one or both and I'd like to keepwhat allies we can, since the majority of guilds would rather see us fall as a guild than anythingelse. But, if you are to battle someone, yes, you bow first when you enter the room, and as youare doing battle, do so with pure honor and lack of any fear. I recommend reading 'shelp pk',as that's a somewhat solid file written by Vertebraker himself. If there are any otherquestions or confusion don't hesitate to ask or confront me in person or in a mail.That's what I'm here for, your guidance as a Great Samurai Warrior.Jacob the Emperor'**Killing people.(chant):**I figure we probably need a board that keeps this somewhere as it would be fairly cool.But I have killed Recca 3 times since I have joined the Samurai and I have killedSami one time.  it would be really cool if there was a board upstairs that had every onesname on it and you could look at a persons name and see who they have on their list.**Bushido(valen):**I have transcend to Enlightenment.  I encourage you to always be vigilante and you shall not falter.  Every death was a breath of new life.  I shall not forget the Bushido code.Valen, Ex-Emperor of the Samurai.**Emperor(valen):**The last Samurai Emperor is now Jacob.  He shall lead all Samurai as your Emperor.**Earwax/Nerfs(illarion):**I had a chance to look over the code for the guild today, and found thatyour offensive and defensive bonuses had been not just nerfed, but almostentirely removed.  This has been fixed, although some of the nerfingremains.This means you'll likely find yourself doing more damage, but you'llalso take more damage in offensive stance, so be careful.It also means there are non-RP reasons for using traditional Japaneseweapons again, including Duncan MacLeod's katana.  You won't getthe sp heal, but there are other benfits to using it.Some of you had surely noticed that your stances didn't do much, and thatyou weren't getting any defensive emotes.  If something like this happensin the future, please don't feel you have to suffer in silence.  Send mea mudmail, or a tell if I'm not idle.**Hey(jaster):**Where is the Samurai Guild at? i have seen no one log in, no emperor, no servents. someone, let me know there is still hope for our guild!!!**Emperor(jaster):**I have Been Appointed Emperor. It is time for us to Awaken Brothern. Hear my call. Return us to our former Glory!!!~~~Jaster~~~ S.P.E.**offwield(illarion):**I've made some adjustments to offwield so that it's no longerusing a hodgepodge of paladin and dervish code to work.Please let me know if you detect any issues with it.- Illarion**setmon(illarion):**You can now use the following codes in your setmon:&kamae&&focus&&kiai&If there are any issues with this or you have ideas forany additional codes, send me mudmail- Illarion**"
