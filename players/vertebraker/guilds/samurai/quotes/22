Life is like unto a long journey with a heavy burden.
  Let thy step be slow and steady, that thou stumble not.
  Persuade thyself that imperfection and inconvenience are
    the natural lot of mortals, and there will be no room
    for discontent, neither for despair.
    
When ambitious desires arise in thy heart, recall the days
  of extremity thou has passed through.
  
Forbearance is the root of quietness and assurance forever.

Look upon the wrath of the enemy.
  If thou knowest only whatit is to conquer, and knowest not
  what it is to be defeated, woe unto thee;
  it will fare ill with thee.

Find fault with thyself rather than with others.
