When one has made a decision to kill a person,
  even if it will be very difficult to succeed by
  advancing straight ahead,
  it will not do to think about doing it in a
  long, roundabout way.
  
One's heart may slacken,
  he may miss his chance,
  and by and large there will be no success.

The Way of the Samurai is one of immediacy,
  and it is best to dash in headlong.
