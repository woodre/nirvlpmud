The entire country will soon be in the hands of your master,
  Lord Ieyasu.
  
If this is so, the men who served him will no doubt hope to
  become daimyo by his appointment.

You should know that if such feelings arise, they are inevitably
  the beginning of the end of one's fortunes in 
  the Way of the Warrior.

Being affected by the avarice for office and rank, or wanting
  to become a daimyo and being eager for such things ... 
  will not one then begin to value his life?
  
And how can a man commit acts of martial valor if he values his life?

A man who has been born into the house of a warrior and yet places
  no loyalty in his heart and thinks only of the fortune of his
  position will be flattering on the surface and construct
  schemes in his heart, will forsake righteousness and not reflect
  on his shame, and will stain the warrior's name of his household
  to later generations. This is truly regrettable.
