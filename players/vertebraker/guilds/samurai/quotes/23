Strategy is the craft of the warrior.
  Commanders must enact the craft, and troopers should know this Way.

There is no warrior in the world today who really understands the
  Way of strategy....

It is said the warrior's is the twofold Way of pen and sword,
  and he should have a taste for both Ways.

Students of the Ichi school Way of strategy should train from
  the start with the sword and long sword in either hand.
This is a truth: when you sacrifice your life, you must make
  fullest use of your weaponry.
It is false not to do so, and to die with a weapon yet undrawn.

In strategy your spiritual bearing must not be 
  any different from normal.
Both in fighting and in everday life you should be determined
  though calm.
Meet the situation without tenseness yet not recklessly,
  your spirit settled yet unbiased.

If the enemy thinks of the mountains, attack like the sea;
  and if he thinks of the sea, attack like the mountains.

If we watch men of other schools discussing theory,
  and concentrating on techniques with the hands,
  even though they seem skillfull to watch,
  they have not the slightest true spirit.
