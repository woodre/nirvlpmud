PK

  This guild is designed for PK.  You can choose to opt out, but
  if a fellow Samurai is in need of assistance, you should assist
  them with whatever they need.  It is strongly encouraged that you
  set PK, particularly after reaching the rank of Shogun.
  
  These rules may even be altered later.
