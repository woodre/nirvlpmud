The Sith

----------------------------------------------------------------

Guild writeup by Vertebraker@Nirvana 

----------------------------------------------------------------

The Sith are a race of humanoids, from a faraway planet. They have
landed on Nirvana running away from a Dark Jedi extermination of
their kind. Hoping to preserve their racial magic and manipulation
of the Force, they have started a new Sith Order, recruiting
potential members and altering their DNA, amalgamating their former
characteristics with those of the Sith race.

The Sith race itself is one strongly magic-based. They are masters
of dark and destructive magic. They are most blatantly evil, and
diametrically opposed to all that is Good in the universe.

They are beings of darkness and rest their bones there....,

----------------------------------------------------------------

They have a loose Hierarchy, one that will manifest itself in the
Guild as:

Force Incarnate - Guild Wizard

10. Sith'ari   - Guild Commander
9.  Jen'dari   - Dark Lord of the Sith, Guild Lieutenant
8.  Karzye     - Hero
7.  Meistras   - Master
6.  Maras      - Bane
5.  Sergeti    - Guardian
4.  Ranka      - Hand
3.  Kissai     - Acolyte
2.  Ver'Juslus - Force Sensitive
1.  Suaukes    - Adult
0.  Kudik      - Baby

For each rank, player may learn x of y spells from each rank.
Because of this, players may customize their player versus
another. Even the Sith'ari does not have knowledge of every spell....

Advancement requires XP, Monetary Sacrifice and Live Sacrifice.
Advancement to rank 9  requires the approval of the Sith'ari.
Advancement to rank 10 requires the approval of the Force Incarnate.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Sacrifice -

 a) Monetary Sacrifice

 Sacrifice to the Sith cause is a component of advancement and is required
 for advancement and the gaining of new knowledge. Cash only!

 b) Live Sacrifice

 After a monster has been weakened to 0/10, it may be sacrificed by the
 player. This accumulates points in the gob.

 sac_pts = (monster_xp_value / 100);
 if(sac_pts > 1000)  /* 100k mob xp cap */
  sac_pts = 1000; 

 
----------------------------------------------------------------

Circles -

 Each Jen'dari may form a circle... this is sort of a clan within
 the Sith. From within the circle, players may...

 1) Teleport to each other
 2) Have a communal chat line
 3) Leave messages for each other
 4) ???  needs expansion
