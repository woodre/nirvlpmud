instead of a room loading a monster or three
it loads and encounter daemon
transports the party to an arena of sorts, lets say 5x5
loads creatures based on the level of the party leader
scatters them about the 5x5, but prolly on one side
the daemon keeps track of where everyone is

in addition to the main daemon, there would also need to be
an ai daemon

the room descs actually make a request to the main daemon
and it returns a map of the arena, with the locations of the
enemies and players marked
if a player or creature has a ranged type weapon and is not
engaged they can enter ranged mode
which allows them to target any creature that isnt in the
same room, every heartbeat doing minimal damage
no exp is awarded until the end of the battle
then it is calculated and treasure dropped
I wanted to make it so anyone could use it with a config
file


AI daemon controls monster movement and casting and whatnot
monsters labeled like tank, caster, ranged
