I was walking around looking for a sheep to make bowlegged and i 
had some thoughts regarding noob helpers and noobs in general 
none of these are particularly fleshed, but just thought i'd toss 
them out there for your perusal... 
 
Salvation army box, (poly tug, anything of that nature) - when 
something is stuck in there, set its value to 0, saveability to 
non (except that it can be stored back into the tug, whatever) 
-This way shit doesn't get yanked as sellage 
 
set noob helpers to track xp given to noobs in parties....ie, if 
upus parties up a noob and supplies them with a mil exp, it says 
ooh, upus got this noob a mil exp, let's log it!  (because we don't 
have enough logs)....info might be good later on down the road for 
something i wanna do, i need more thoughts on it, and thinking is 
difficult. 
 
noob helper clanhall kinda dohickey, was thinking mebbe make it an 
addendum to the hall of apprentices or something, or a standalone 
type deal....a little board in there, a non-resetting room, etc 
 
a way for noobs to do feedback on noob helpers and everything in 
general, yeah i know they can mail, etc, but if they had a command, 
or something pop up when they went to gain a level from 8 to 9,  
say hey, what'd you think of noob helpers, did you receive help, or 
what could they do different, anything to add, mail verte, earwax, 
vital, anyone with a pulse, etc 
 
a 'true noob' flag.....ie, if they logon as a true noob, put that 
flag in there for noob helpers to see, i KNOW that's a bad thing in 
the eyes of rp, but come on now, what's rp here....and i don't 
think players would mind so much, cuz hey, noob helpers are really 
lowbie helpers too, *I* know that this guy i'm dragging is prolly  
an alt, but fuckit....it'd just be nice to see at a glance, so that 
if you see someone who's a true noob, or listed as one you can make 
that extra effort to say hey, anything i can help you with, or any 
questions feel free to ask me or use the 'newbie line' .... 
when you see 5 level 1s, you don't really do that individually... 
but if one of them were to have that flag you would i'd hope 
 
in noob helper hall, could have info on suggested gear, (is what 
board would be good for) perhaps a 'condensed suggested gear list)  
or something to be given to noobs....ie, trident of war (on rock 
in rift/ryllian/saber's area) is a really good weapon for noobs,  
BECAUSE .... it heals you up real good when you fight)....or the  
following are unbreakable weapons (which are my favorites to give 
to noobs, they got enough to learn about without fucking with having 
to sharpen and coin for sharpens) 

lowering of standards for regen items 
too much emphasis on heals, let's open it up for regens....there is 
no valid reason in my eyes to keep regens so damn limited....maybe 
there was 10 years ago, but the mud was a lot different 10 years ago 
 
consolidated noob areas....i'd like to see perhaps 'noob portals'  
in the entrances/exits to noob areas....instead of doing the 50 dirs 
to get to/from mash privates or ryllian bandits or trix babies, or 
mael's castle stuff, noobs could just kinda zip through....HOWEVER 
i would only like to see that for the lowest level stuff, part of  
game is starting to learn your way around, it's just extremely  
frustrating at first....i can remember personally trying to find my 
way back from the bandits....it SEEMS simple, but it's not as easy  
just reversing the dirs, you make a wrong turn and you end up in  
strange places....think I died as a semi-true-noob (years ago of  
course) when i started playing again....i imagine anyone who's a 
completely true noob has as well, just finding their way to/from the 
noob areas 
OR have a noob-area-emporium....hell, just house it all under one  
room - it'd require taking some of those areas out of regular wiz  
areas, but why not....i'm sure many would be willing, plus those 
wizzes (there are a ton of them) who ONLY coded a noob/lowbie area 
and then nothing after, well....why not just stick them in one spot 
and free up that backbone space for something a little more involved 
and open to other chars 
 
cheat-sheet ... now, there's all sorts of ways to get dirs to noob 
areas or to things of interest, but nothing consolidated or simple 
to use/take with....how about a 'cheat sheet' or help file for it 
simply listing what, and dirs.....ie 'bandits: 5e,3n,w,step rift, 
2w,enter...blah' and then DIRS TO RETURN from it 
once again, i remember filtering through the list of dirs for noob 
areas and getting frustrated.... 
 
noob 'word of recall' yeah....dikus suck for most part, but that is 
a nice thing on them 
the noob school for godwars muds is also something that's nice or 
worth logging onto one just to take a look....maybe it's rom muds in 
general (diku derivatives essentially) but i'm pretty sure the  
godwars variety all have noob schools 
 
faq - noob variety, intermediate player variety and bigger player  
variety 
 
it'd be nice if all that was on the website....how about offering 
one of the non-coding type wizzes the opportunity to start putting 
this (and other similar type info) on the website as well....i've  
seen muds with good websites and it really helps attract people to 
the muds...medievia's is incredibly thorough if i remember right 

base gear....why NOT give them base gear....come on, that's shit 
in hall of apprentices, with the inflation here, why NOT give them 
something different....this i've heard from some good players 
as well 
 
noob hostels.....storage is probably one of the most frustrating 
things as a noob....you sit there and say hey, i got this stuff, it 
seems really cool but how do i keep it 
it's frustrating as hell, if you don't know the game, believe me 
 
regarding storage: why not open up more lockers or storage....make 
it 1k for first 3 items, 5k for next 3 lockers, 10k for each after 
that, or something... no limit 
even the casa de nirvy gets real expensive real fast for low levels 
especially ones who can only logon for a few hours a weekend or  
whatnot.... 
 
when they die at < lvl 6 stuff stays on them?  
 
< lvl 9 logon and get issued stuffs every logon?  unbreakable noob 
wpn perhaps?  
 
coins for errands and other things.... 
on other muds there's noncombat things that noobs can do for cash 
ie, there's a quest on one particular mud that requires 'stump  
standers' .... to get into area you need two other people with you, 
so the practice used to be to hire standers....people who would 
go to that area to allow you to get in...easy way to make some quick 
cash....things of that nature would be nice, ... haven't thought it 
out any further than that 
 
-------------- 
anyways, i'm sorry this dragged on so far, had a lot more coming 
to mind as i went through, feel free to forward this beast, or a 
condensed version, to any/all the noob helpers for their feedback 
as well, or other wizzes for that matter.... 
 
it's just random shit, some of it's worth some thought at least i 
think tho....anyways, it's a start :)
