short_desc "A [37mgrey[0m warhorse named Blockhead"
long_desc "A stout, strong-looking warhorse with a growling demeanor and astern look on its face. A long muzzle and beautiful brown eyeshighlight its large head.  He snorts occasionally and seems to staredirectly at you. His legs have seen some exercise, and it looks asthough it is very powerful and fast."
