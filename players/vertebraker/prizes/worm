a combo spell i guess, costs some sp and coins. 
1st a sharpen i pay gold for, to sharpen my sword 
and an enchant for my weapon, i was saying fire.. 
but an optional one would be cool.. hehe. 
fire,dark,lightning .. upping the WC awhile and adding that 
type of damage to my attacks.. sooo. Finely Crafted Longsword (inflamed) 
or (Eletrical) or (Shrouded with Darkness) .. something 
like that. but nothing all weak and worthless, hehe. 
tomorrow will be my first day of HELL. 
when i goto Lafayette to get clean.. i'll be suffering 
big time. my doc even said if i went 'cold turkey' i could 
go into sezuires.. ugh.
