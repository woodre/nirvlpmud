Burn's dmg has been decreased.

However, there has been a big change. It now runs off the mud's
damage types.  This means on targets that are unprotected by
fire-resistant armors, you will do more damage.  Some of the
other guild spells already run off of this. Burn is one of the
last to be converted.
