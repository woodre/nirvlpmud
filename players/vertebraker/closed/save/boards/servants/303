Just an FYI.
GT is ally channel.  GPT is shardak only channel.
Don't be talking Shardak business over the ally channel.  Use the Shardak ONLY channel.
I don't trust anyone and will be severely pissed off if anyone outside of Shardak has insider info because one of our own is too lazy and/or careless to use the proper channels.
This is my only warning.
