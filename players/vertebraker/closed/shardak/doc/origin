to the players its shrouded in mystery
he used to be an angel kind of like lucifer.
he fought against god etc etc, killed many
angels because he believed god's purpose in helping
the creatures of the realm made angels inferior
and then he fell.. and god cursed him as a half-dragon, 
half-man immortal creature
he was shunned from society, and in turn started 
slaying people left and right
so eventually an order of heroes trapped him deep within a heavy rock wall
he became imprisoned with aid of their magic
as time went on, the spell binding him within the rock weakened
finally in 2034(or whenever the wastelands is supposed to be), the 
nuclear blast that eliminated most of the human populace destroyed the rock
and blasted it open, freeing him again
why does he need followers? he wants to wreak havoc against the 
land again..build an army.. conquer and slay
he went against "god" because the creatures of this realm (the players) were
 given special treatment
