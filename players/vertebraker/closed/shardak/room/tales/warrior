	A sad sight, is it not?
	I once thought that no stronger warrior than I had walked the
	earth. I gained tremendous powers from the generosity of the
	master of my guild, Shardak. On my own, I learned one or two
	knacks with both magic and steel. Quickly I grew reckless and
	eventually challenged Shardak, confident that I could take his
	place in the guild...

The ghost sighs and continues:
	Now I serve to inform the interested about the guild and the
	immense strength Shardak holds. Speak the word you wish to be
	given information about. I can tell you about Shardak, members
	of the guild, the qualities they have, and joining the guild.
