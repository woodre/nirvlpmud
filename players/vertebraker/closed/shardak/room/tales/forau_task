  Forau smirks at you and begins, "Master granted me great
spellcasting power.  The magic powers granted to me manifest
themselves in the form of a devastating blast of dark energy,
the appearance of which I have complete control over.
I would grant this power to you, but..."
  Forau snickers at something amusing only to himself. "We all
have our own interests, don't we," he implies.  "These potions
you see before you, these very dark elixirs require one element
which I myself cannot produce. For eons, I have turned to Warriors
such as yourself for this key ingredient."
  He glances around furtively, then whispers to you, "The ingredient
is the gore from a demon.  With this, I will be able to create more
potions for our Army of the Dark."  He pauses and stares at you.
He speaks,  "Go now and bring me back some of this demon's gore,
and the spell shall be yours."
