	Fighting ability is stressed most by Shardak. A member of the
	guild must train to become a balanced fighting warrior. A member
	must be wise in all areas of combat. Fighting monsters is an
	important part of the guild, but everyone must also master the art
	of slaying other people. Without this a warrior cannot gain power.
	If a warrior can prove his worth to Shardak, his rewards will
	be great. Shardak is not easily pleased however, so be warned.
