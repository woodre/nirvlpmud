  The priestess speaks in a solemn tone of voice, "The day has
come. Shardak's dark mages have cast the spell that will enable
the power to flow unhindered from Baal and to this reality."
  She pauses briefly. "I am the high-priestess of Baal and the
only person with the capacity to contact Him. If you give me a
newborn child, I shall sacrifice it to Baal and He will grant
you dark powers."
