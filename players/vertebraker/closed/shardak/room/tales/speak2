	People join the forces of Shardak for different reasons. Some do
	not want to join the members of the Cult or the ancients here,
	some just lust for Shardak's power, and some just love to kill.
	The members of Shardak's people are a close group of warriors,
	however they each have their own interests and competition is
	heavy to gain guild powers. It is not seldom that members within
	the group fight each other to the death to prove their worth.
