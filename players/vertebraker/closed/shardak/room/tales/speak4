	If you wish to join the forces of Shardak's people, type
	'join' now.  However, be warned, you must not have ties to other
	groups. Shardak will have you be loyal to no one but him.  Also do
	not join unless you are certain about your choice; the only way to
	leave the group is to have Shardak kill you. After your blood is
	mixed with the other members you are a member for life. Mixing your
	blood with the other members makes their blood flow in your veins.
	Shardak will only let you leave if he drains all of your blood from
	you. And he will not raise you from the dead then...
