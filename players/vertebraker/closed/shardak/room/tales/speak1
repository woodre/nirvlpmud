	Shardak is somewhat of a mystery. Some believe that he was at
	Satan's right hand side centuries ago. It is said he tried to
	take over the power of the underworld and was cast out by Lucifer
	himself. He ended up on Earth in the form of a half dragon-man.
	He was able to keep his great powers, but was doomed to a life
	in confinement somewhere on Earth. The nuclear blast in 2003
	broke him free. He came to the Wastelands to gather forces with
	the little life that was left. Now he trains warriors in the skills
	of death. He grants them with powers as they prove their worth.
