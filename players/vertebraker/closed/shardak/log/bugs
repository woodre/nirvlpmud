Entropy   Jul 13 02:49 : Um priest advance lets you do it a whole bunch and it's bad, Ill explain more in person.
Revenge   Jul 13 09:58 : Uh, I can't get back into the guild hall:)
Someone   Jul 13 10:15 : set a cost on sharpening
Worm      Jul 15 00:01 : burn .. one of them gives a 0 .. dunno if it doesnt hit
Worm      Jul 15 14:35 : light works, thanks.
Worm      Jul 15 17:22 : Cerb has fire cast, i could use his and could use it when i cast mine (burn)
Worm      Jul 16 02:37 : Blaze doesnt cost SP
Worm      Jul 16 03:36 : Layla had a kid, i ran in guildhall, handed it to priestess .. not young enough.. wtf? can i get credit on that? i worked hard to get her knocked up and that baby there on time ;)
Worm      Jul 16 23:29 : HIGH lvl players show up as WIZ on others
Worm      Jul 17 01:28 : sword, longswords etc dont work for slayer .. it says any sword! :)
Worm      Jul 17 02:24 : sacrificing holy items for xp.. ahhh that'd be nice
Worm      Jul 17 02:39 : still get a 0 now and then when i burn
Worm      Jul 17 02:44 : fear testers who never stay and test
Worm      Jul 17 02:44 : execute
Worm      Jul 17 02:46 : conjure and blaze for no sps.. woo!
Worm      Jul 17 12:23 : still gettin a 0 now and then when i burn
Worm      Jul 17 12:23 : should i be able to blaze, watch the room get chewed on then attack when they are like 3/10? (altar boys) i like it!
Worm      Jul 17 12:24 : are all these guildbugs from me? execute!
Entropy   Jul 17 13:30 : Manskin bag, when you open it, it tells you that you are closing it.
Entropy   Jul 17 13:32 : You can get the manskin bag for free, but you can sell it to the merchant for around 500 coins (ya know Im only 1 bug away from getting a special item so all these guildbugs are tempting heh)
Worm      Jul 17 19:44 : i am the viper, ive come to vipe thy vindows
Worm      Jul 17 20:41 : im like the only one i ever see testin.. so.. uhm, just max me so we can get this over with *snicker* of course, that was a joke
Worm      Jul 19 11:35 : in baseball, 1,2,3 you're out.. Man was one, Church was two and this Beest was three.. i havent died 3 times in all the time I played before I dont think.. maybe i'm just not cut out for this shit anymore.. startin to feel like it.
Worm      Jul 19 11:46 : bah, seriously bro.. I dont think you should have to jack that trial down any if you did it twice then it should be fine.. I came into guild at like 5.5 million, im a 2.9 now.. tried to be a good sport about it .. but uhm, fuck that.. the guild is awesome.. i just dont think I can swing it.
Stochos   Jul 19 20:13 : failing trial
Stochos   Jul 19 20:13 : err the flame trial isn't working for me...is lvl checked
Worm      Jul 19 21:13 : confuse dont work on
Worm      Jul 19 21:13 : or is it meant just for me?
Stochos   Jul 21 12:49 : i tried the smiths Buckler, i'm getting sensitive mind errors and can't remove or drop it
Worm      Jul 21 18:36 : Bow would be a good changed emote .. but to what?
Worm      Jul 24 15:34 : Bardiche doesnt seem to work right
Worm      Jul 25 01:44 : I ended up with an item called an "Editor" tonight.. well, noticed it.. used Creator on it, said Balowski made it.. you know of it? anyway, no idea how i got it.. told her if i shouldnt have it to dest it.
Worm      Jul 25 15:58 : Studa tells you: on Worm hails Shardak as lord. you need a \n for the one the room sees
Worm      Jul 26 09:31 : Has the Bardiche been repaired?
Worm      Jul 26 10:04 : I dont know the norm these days.. have a hard time graspin whats good and bad
Worm      Jul 28 11:43 : Heres a problem, we'll open.. be few in number and weak in power.. and between the knights and lucky curse be hunted day and night. What the hell am i supposed to do about that? heh
Worm      Jul 28 12:33 : blaze may need to be checked
Worm      Jul 28 20:15 : Confuse: is it meant to stop all fighting? it doesnt if so.
Worm      Jul 28 21:52 : im gonna deep fry luckycurse
Worm      Jul 28 23:38 : Blaze seems to be hurting me now.. but not others.. heh
Worm      Jul 28 23:40 : I leave, i get hurt .. Symbio leaves, nothing.. heh :)
Worm      Jul 29 01:19 : 4x4 maybe?
Worm      Jul 29 01:19 : too big? 2x2 then ;)
Worm      Jul 29 19:02 : a bug i dunno how to explain.. heh
Worm      Jul 29 19:57 : Ok, i had blaze up.. Korn and kids were there.. we were talkin about how it worked etc.. asked him to leave and come back.. he left, got hit a bit and his kids died.. like 6 times each, 12 corpse an 2 kids still standing each with 4hps remaining
Worm      Jul 30 03:34 : Burn on Cerberus with inferno and blaze .. 5 once, 10 twice, 30 once.. he didnt have much gear
Worm      Jul 30 03:35 : Encircled him as well.. it did no damage to him
Worm      Aug  1 20:11 : maybe course could be pumped up just a tad ;)
Worm      Aug  1 23:14 : I cant remove notes
Worm      Aug  1 23:14 : i dont think my bonuses are workin ;)
Worm      Aug  1 23:43 : oh.. and burn.. i tested it with cerb the other day, very weak .. 5, 5, 10, 30, only hit decent once and even 30 aint that great ;)
Worm      Aug  2 21:19 : bring a corpse of a player to shardak, he'll give you a tad of guild xp depending on players level.. heh
Worm      Aug  5 11:24 : Terror works on mobs... ;) i like it, leave it that way!
Worm      Aug  5 11:24 : hehe
Worm      Aug  5 13:12 : i'd like to be able to see invis members and allies on our gw ;)
Worm      Aug  5 22:30 : whats our policy on blazin a creature next to death then attacking? dont allow it?
Worm      Aug  5 22:31 : ally channel is still actin strange.. when they log out and come back they cant talk.. still see, just no talkin
Worm      Aug  5 23:29 : I've been making up little stradegies for shardak pk.. we need a way to turn the inferno off if we want.. even if it comes at glvl 8 ;) if possible i mean.. heh
Worm      Aug  5 23:35 : Fix Hierarchy help file ;)
Kotcha    Aug  7 23:25 : This is not nessasarilay a bug, but Worm said to tell you.  To alleaviate the lack of good align mobs to kill if wi had a hard time for mobs from -10 - -1000 it would allow for us to kill Neutral mobs
Kotcha    Aug  7 23:44 : blaze should die if your conjure flame gos out, or burn should work if there is a blaze. unless I misunderstand the concept.
Quen      Aug  9 13:56 : the niches Heal an item going into them. ie... a weapons goes in dull comes out like new
Kotcha    Aug 10 21:02 : If you drain a corpse in the hotel room it eats all the inventory of the corpse, not sure if thats a guild thing or hotel thing
Worm      Aug 11 13:30 : Ok, i killed Snatch with Inferno .. he kept stealing our corpses and cash.. newbies dont do that.
Worm      Aug 11 13:43 : If you take heat over it im sorry, didnt think you would because he's a damn thief.. maybe inferno can query level
Kotcha    Aug 12 00:03 : Free xp
Kotcha    Aug 12 00:03 : Ok If I goto a mob cast course and leave the mob will die and I will get xp
Kotcha    Aug 12 00:36 : Boltar fixed the reapeating damage of the course spell so it didn't kill mobs when we were not in the room...8)
Worm      Aug 12 12:09 : Just like servants.. allies, lists em all :)
Worm      Aug 12 14:16 : Confuse all didnt work ..
Worm      Aug 12 15:49 : A dream: The room we spoke of.. with one more little add in.. hehe. Tunnels to several key locations on Nirvana.. tunnels only I can see and access. like 3 or 4 of em .. no sp to use .. just like walking.. maybe a delay of a few secs? :) think thats possible?
Worm      Aug 12 15:52 : i mean, tunnels i can access from both rooms of course .. my room and the exit locations.. to hop in and out ;) hehe
Worm      Aug 12 17:59 : Encircle only works on Shards
Kotcha    Aug 13 20:31 : I am getting a sensitive mind error when I use course 30% of the time.
Kotcha    Aug 16 20:03 : Not sure this is a bug or this is how this works..I type breath (Bishop) in this case 40 Flame points get subtracted and it says 'Your eyes twinkle a deep crimson as you nod at Blood Crusher.' 'Kotcha nods at Blood Crusher.' He didn't seem to breath fire if this is the only emotes that he does and it works thats kewl, but it seems like seeing a dragon engulf a mob in Dragon fire would be a kewl looking emote.  If There is a delay in the breath and I killed the mob before I saw flame spout from my dragon I will send a mail appologising for this bugreport.
Kotcha    Aug 16 20:05 : This may be a Eurale Problem too, I was using a Brandish wand and when it was supposed to dest itself it errorerd and had unlimited charges...8)
Kotcha    Aug 17 22:14 : Not really a bug more an idea...Maybe Dragons could have kewl emotes like (Dragons name) lowers its head and snorts toxic gas in (Targets) face.  (Newline) Targets eyes water or something dark.
Worm      Aug 18 14:10 : Spinal doesnt seem to wear his shield.
Tristram  Aug 20 01:22 : damn sumon slayer "someone is doing it" shit!
Worm      Aug 20 21:38 : Encircle stacks
Worm      Aug 23 18:12 : this would rock .. Mirror Image, Glvl 8, 150-200sp? creates 3 images of you w/ small but decent ammount of hp, they dont deal damage just take it for a few rounds. the trick is it radomly put you somewhere in the stack. IE: when cast there are 4 Vertes in the room, you could possibly be Verte 1, 2, 3 or 4.. even when they're on to the trick it would leave them guessing for a second with it placing you in the stack randomly
Worm      Aug 23 19:19 : drain isnt poppin bones .. ive killed big and small and a good number of both.. no bones
Tristram  Aug 28 14:49 : have initial burn call conjure flame at an add. cost if not already there
Worm      Aug 31 04:08 : invite someone to lobby.. inferno is there, they show and burn you invite and terror and invite and terror untill they're dead *snicker* nothing i'd do.. just thought of it
Worm      Sep  1 12:29 : would it be possible for shards to see invis allies on gw and not allies.. where allies couldnt use it to hunt down other invis allies etc
Worm      Sep  1 12:43 : Spinal wearing shield still doesnt show.. emotes he does but doesnt seem to be when you look at him.
Worm      Sep  1 12:57 : Everything i presence seems to be a "her" .. try it :)
Budman    Sep  5 22:01 : altarboy presenced it...called it a her
Tristram  Sep 15 17:12 : confuse sucks
Tristram  Sep 16 16:38 : let shards enter.. bah
Tristram  Sep 16 16:38 : add unbagall
Beast     Oct  4 01:47 : every once in a while when i try to go east I'm getting the mind message    if I try to go east again it normally works
Sid       Oct 11 18:49 : It says in help conjure flames that the flames are the first step to any pyro spell like burn etc. yet I can cast burn w/out the flames....
Beast     Nov  7 11:35 : using score (score and sc) the first line seems to be bugged...all I see is 0
Beast     Nov 20 15:34 : Don't know if this is a bug or just how you chose to end it but when i ask the priest what my trial is it sends me to the merchant.  The merchant sends me to do the drragon quest again.
Beast     Nov 22 10:33 : conjure flame allows you to go negative into sps  didn't know if you knew or not
Beast     Nov 25 08:56 : counjure flame allows you to go negative in sps (not sure if you knew or not)
Beast     Nov 25 09:00 : i think whatever happens when you die somehow messes up guild exp   I knew I had more then I needed but it wouldn't allow me to advance (guild) for some time. After when I did get rank 7 it said I needed 2mil to advance rank.  I went to advance (game) 2 levels and went back and it said I needed roughly 1.5 mil to advance (guild)  Sorry this was so long but I wanted to make sure you knew what I was talking about.
Beast     Nov 25 09:34 : ignite has no help ... thought you might want to know
Beast     Dec  2 07:37 : check the player files  the top exp list today showed notgone,scathesux,wormrocks,kazerrocks,vertewhore top on list all over 70mil exp
Tristram  Dec  9 22:58 : Ok check fly msgs.  fukt up
Beast     Dec 18 17:40 : course allows you to go into negative sps
Beast     Dec 27 15:22 : sacrifice soul   when u do this and put in the name of the mob and shardak re-grants your power back "he" only re-grants 1 power back   if there has been two powers taken away both do not come back
Beast     Jan  6 15:05 : using the spell storm one of the emotes comes out with lightingshoots   should be a space in there i think
Cerberus  Jan 19 21:51 : when Coda lost his char, he made a new 'Coda' that is a lvl 1 non shardak, but when I finger him it still says the Servant of Shardak, the Apprentice...
Cerberus  Mar 21 02:42 : you can keep emoting the burn spell after you run out of sps...
Tristram  Apr 21 14:11 : Fix it so you don't see msgs after Dragon leaves the room while mounted
Tristram  Apr 21 14:25 : in "blaze". prints your name "holds his right hand" even tho you're the one who casted da spell.l
Tristram  Apr 21 14:25 : Decrease dmg for Dragon against other|fire
Spyder    May  4 22:34 : help follow
VertebrakeSep 25 02:52 : make guild rooms no clean
Dazed     Oct  1 18:31 : . .  .   .    .nEeD sLaYeR!
Dazed     Oct  1 18:31 : . .  .   .    .nEeD sLaYeR!
Dazed     Oct  7 16:44 : after a new ally accepts it tells you "Time has expired.  Carver is NOT an Ally." if when they are ;)
Dazed     Oct  7 16:44 : er, even.
Dazed     Oct  7 16:44 : hehe
Dazed     Oct 13 01:25 : master needs more niches ;)
Dazed     Oct 13 01:35 : encircle isnt workin on others again
Dazed     Mar 11 19:57 : heh
Dazed     Mar 11 19:57 : divine at priestess is fuck up :)
Sunim     May  3 23:38 : I looked for the grotto where it usually is, and it's not there, I use escape, exit out the entrance, and it's still not there.
Sunim     May  4 04:26 : when using the invite command (I don't plan on using it until after beta) but anyways it says 'Who do want to invite into the guild?' as opposed to who do YOU.....
Budah     May  6 03:40 : Law title
Budah     May  6 03:40 : Law title and Senior title aren't working.
Worm      May  6 17:47 : Shardak demands too much gold from me :)
Lloyd     May  6 22:38 : scythe
Sunim     May 10 22:37 : I dunno if the tracker is specific to the guild now, but....I just killed sticks and it didn't record a pk on my tracker
Sunim     May 11 20:27 : I got a little bit of a bug, I have gotten pk kills in the past several days that have not recorded to my pk tracker
Mortarion May 17 12:50 : Perhaps we could have the guild smith make armor for our dragons and spinal
Hal       May 17 13:34 : The smithy should be able to repair armors.  He can make armor so why not repair it?  Overall seems dumb that one round against Zantetsuken can wipe out all your armors and there's nothing we can do about it when it might take you how long to actually get the armors like elemental armors, bracers of speed, etc.
Amiro     May 20 15:38 : today I logged in at the church and died immediately.  i don't know how the fuck it happened...but it was weird. illarion restored my xp. -amiro
Worm      May 28 14:34 : slayer seems to suck! tweak tweak!
Worm      May 28 14:53 : Encircle is fuckin up. Why do we have to cast it on others and cant cast it on ourselve?
Budah     Jun  7 16:56 : dragonooze I was in ooze, mounted my dragon, and soared in the air so that I could go afk and not worry about someone sendin whiteblade after me.. when I came back I landed, dismounted and started to fight the mob when it kicked me out of the ooze.
Worm      Aug 28 14:59 : Where are the boards! Argh!
Baskin    Feb 18 10:49 : I am confused. Why does our own dragon (a thing of fire) take damage from our flames we conjure? This seems kind of silly. It should not take damage from that.
Blake     Oct 11 21:21 : anyway to get rid of the names on servants that are no longer existing, or no longer shardaks??
Tembo     Oct 12 16:00 : shardak light
Tembo     Oct 12 16:00 : shardak "light" fails to light dark areas sometimes.
Tembo     Oct 15 11:42 : missing the help file for "darkness" spell
Blake     Oct 20 12:40 : no help file for ignite
Blake     Oct 20 21:34 : firegrip help says inferno on the top of the page
PestilenceNov  5 17:39 : inv command doesn't even work
Tembo     Sep  4 17:17 : The dark room bug is really annoying, everytime i go into a dark room i am unable to see even with the "light" command and an extra torch
