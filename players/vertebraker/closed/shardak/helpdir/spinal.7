	      |    For this spell you  need a pile of    |
	     /    bones.  With it you can invoke the    /
	    |    skeleton warrior Spinal. Spinal is    |
	    |    able to employ weapons and shields.   |
	     \    It reacts to 'spinal wield / wear /   \
	      |    unwield / drop <item>'.  Spinal is    |
	       \    difficult  to control and  attacks    \
		|    at will.                              |
