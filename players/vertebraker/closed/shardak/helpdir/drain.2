	      |    Drain the wavering essence of life    |
	     /    from a slain foe. The stronger the    /
	    |    previously  living  foe, the  more    |
	    |    health  his  remnants  will yield.    |
	     \    Beware!  If no corpse lies at your    \
	      |    feet,  the outcome of 'drain' will    |
               \    be unpredictable.  You may also       \
                | "drain for bones", for a slightly       |
                | higher chance of getting bones.         |
