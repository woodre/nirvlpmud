06/19/06 Earwax:  Per Fakir's urging and lots of bitching by the 
current members, I've implemented a change.  This change was approved
by both myself and Boltar, and suggested by Fakir, and is implemented
purely pending Vertebraker's return.  As it was, all members of the
guild would take damage upon Shardak's death.  Now, the safe rooms
become enterable upon his death instead.
