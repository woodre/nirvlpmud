   The Journeyman
  - ------ - ------- - ------- - -- --------- -----

   The Journeyman is a notch above a Novice, one
   still in training, but one who has shown the
   ability and willingness to learn from His Lordship
   and support His Will.  The Journeyman will
   support his Commanders and is loyal above all;
   Although his power may not be great, the Journeyman
   makes up for it with gusto and strength in
   combat.
