   The Magi
  - ------ - ------- - ------- - -- --------- -----

  The Magi are those powerful wizards who have resurrected
  Shardak from his years of eternal sleep within the
  Earth.  They have been granted much power by his
  Lordship in return for their very souls .. they
  have been granted immortality, but everything comes
  with a price...

   [The words of the Magi must be taken as though
    they came from the mouth of Lord Shardak, they
    are his eyes and ears on this plane]
