   The Novice
  - ------ - ------- - ------- - -- --------- -----

   The Novice is a new entry into the guild, a young
   virgin unused to the ways of extreme evil and
   destruction voiced through the Servants of the
   Shardak.  The Novice is the meat which is pushed
   through the grinder to create the Warriors
   who populate the guild.  The Novice is not one
   to be welcomed with completely open arms, as
   traitors often show their wicked forms early,
   but it is one to be respected for the willingness
   to learn from the Masters of Evil.
