   The Berzerker
  - ------ - ------- - ------- - -- --------- -----

   The Berzerkers are an intense band of fearless
   warriors who are the Chief Assassins for the guild,
   handpicked by the Law.  The courage of the Berzerkers
   is limitless; they fear not death, but rather embrace
   it when they slay their enemies on the battleground.
   The Berzerkers oppose all that is Good and ruthlessly
   maim, dismember, and slaughter all that stands in
   the way of Shardak and the Servants.

   BERZERKERS:  None as of yet
