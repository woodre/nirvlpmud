/doc/Driver/efun/ and typeof, mapp - I know those two work, I haven't
tried out the others in that directory yet, but I know typeof() and
mapp() work for sure.  Can you cp them to /doc/efun ... just so we
can work on having all the efuns in one place instead of in 
/doc/efun
/doc/efun/DR-driver
/doc/Driver/efun

Etc
