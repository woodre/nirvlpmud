I was thinking about efuns, mainly the ansi/string manipulating ones
How about we have a daemon (/obj/daemons dir would be a good thing)
with ALL the various colour manipulating functions in it.

With that in mind, you make simul efuns for the ones that don't exist,
and to refer to the ones that already did (for backwards compat as well
as simple convenience) to use the daemon

For example - stick delete_colour() code in the daemon
simul efun declaration would then simply be
string delete_colour(string arg) { return (string)TEXTD->delete_colour(arg); }
do that for all the funs

That way we could add line wrapping, other shit to it, lower the loaded 
code in the game (after all, everything inherits simul efun, so cutting
down on that shit i think is worth the eval cost of the function calls)

Just a thought i had, lemme know whatchu think
