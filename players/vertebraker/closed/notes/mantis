Mantis tells you, "I had a fun idea today....make a book....you read the boo
k....and for a certain spell or object...you have to kill a certain monster...(h

inted at in the book) to obtain the spell or object. (both of which would be non

-store and end at reboot.) Sort of a mini quest. The book could be random...so i

t would hint at different monsters each time. A 'password' spoken to the monster

 would enable it to give the object at the time of its death."
