Worm tells you: in general.. a huuuuge wastelands, unlike the old wastes.
i'm talkin after a world war 4 nuked to hell kinda shit..
very few cities and hard to find.. uhm, players start out
with minimal gear (another create a char to play thing)
small town in the middle of wastes.. they go out, wander,
kill bullshit, find shit etc. once they grow they can go
further out.. get better shit etc. players can team up and
really whip ass. later you can build, yes.. Forts! and add
shit on
