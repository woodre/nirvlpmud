One player publicly challenges another, and the message shows to everyone that there has been a challenge issued. A good way of calling someone out without flapping over a public channel. Also, make it so if the challenge is accepted, it goes to a special challenge arena....no leave, no dc, no quit, no tele. maybe make it so if you lose, the winnder gets to pick one piece or something from the opponent's gear, and the coins or something. and get challenge arena win points This would get alot more people interested in pk. maybe even make the death cost less xps. who knows. I just think calling someone out by issuing a public challenge would be better than flapping over a channel. Nyte **crip**Subj: guild ideaDate: Sep 17 04:47A tribal guild..... based off of totems and animal spirits...... as well as a people oriented guild..... have a good running idea and all just ask if you wanna hear some of it! crip **knytemayre**Subj: new guild ideaDate: Sep 17 18:24Here's an idea I've wanted to do myself, but since I'm never going to have enough time to wiz here, let alone relearn how to code LP, I'll pass it on to you. I've always wanted to do an ICP-themed area, and make a Juggalo guild.

How about a guild of dragons!!! some of the details i have came up with: 1.)  Only 5 allowed in the game period, not sure how that would work 2.)  Cannot talk, no tells, no visible says, perhaps "dragon masters" would be able to communicate with them...this could be tied in with a quest.  Or dragon Masters could be a sister guild. 3.)  No weapons, u r a fucking dragon,,,dragonbreath etc.... 4.)  No armor, dragonscales etc..... 5.) 500 million to max guild,,,,just make it way hardcore. 6.)  because of the high exp needed, the power the dragons control would be extreme, when they near the guild max,  I'm talking like 5 rounding mondar, deathmaster etc... So that's my idea for the dragon guild.....the 5 dragon limit could be changed to allow more dragons to exist, but i feel that if you made it hard to get in, not many would walk that path. I would think of the dragon guild as more like a mob, and not a player.  They serve as a background in this game, they have no pk flag, anyone can attack them, and they can attack any pk player. Also they would be immune to any non-teleport room...They are dragons! With the dragon masters they would be immune to the dragons attacks once guild maxed.  They have little power alone but when they control their dragon they are untouchable.  They would be able to understand what the dragons say...etc.... There are problems with this,,,,how many times would they be logged in at the same time? etc.. more ideas i have **tembo**Subj: guildsDate: Sep 18 19:02one guild------> WeaponsMaster Open page here i guess.  Was thinking can use guild weps etc...but the true specialty of the WeaponsMaster is to create his own arsenal! No spells, just specials, or many multiple attacks There would be no guild levels,,,just ranks,  with each rank they master another weapons technique.  First rank they would be able to build a standard sword, they gain no guild expreience while wielding a non guild weapon. Total of 10 ranks i guess. second rank gives another attack technique with the standard sword the other ranks expand the weapons that you can make, as well as how you can use them. The cool part of this is the individual creativity allowed.  The wepons can be customized to an extent, and the techniques can be selected from a huge list. I'm not sure if this has been done before, I haven't been in every guild.

Questing to seek their fullfilment in life as an adult in the knowledge of their ways. They constantly seek power within the spirits of the totems and earth. using animal friends and  their own armor and weapons made by themselves as their only strength against the outside world. **tirnok**Subj: heyDate: Sep 19 13:40Hey man, an old friend of ours stopped by the other day, and I wanted to see if there was anyway you could restore his old char.....

They disdain all weapons but the axe and sword - better to take ones head and be drenched in the blood of your foes.  They collect the heads of their foes and mount them on trophy racks carried about, which gains them the attention of their dark patron.  They also harvest organs from the fallen and incorporate them in ritual defilement for eventual implantation in their bodies which give them more strength. The nurse a total and complete hatred of all life and also hate any and all magic users and spells as the worse of the kind. Killing a spellcaster (mage, BCM etc.) garners them more favor in the eyes of their god.  They lack the mag attrib, but have a new attrib of 'rage' which powers their abilities. They also are dependant on pie as it allows commune with their god.  Str and Sta are maxed at 40 and Rage is  determined by str. Don't have any abilities worked out yet, but will soon.  -Khrell **budah**Subj: mystery guildDate: Oct  9 21:32Hey man, I want to beta your guild, whatever it is.

I was also thinking it would be cool as hell to have a guild level 9.  This guild level gives you the level of 666 on all who screens, as well as some sort of additional attack or special.  One idea i had was to be able to take the shape of shardakbion during battle, or be able to transform for a period of time.  This would lend super strength and higher WC.  Otherwise I had the idea that we could summon a shadow, shardak's shadow, kind of like an extra pet, it lends attacks and AC bonuses.  Just a thought, but I really think the 666 lvl is cool as hell.  Could make glvl 9 worth like 30 million or something outrageous.  Hell, I'd do it!! Just some ideas.   BTW...I would like to see more themed weapons and armors.  I hate the fact that everyone is using the same eq all the time.  I am willing to help if there is anything I can do.  I don't know how to code, and I'm sure Wax is sick of listening to me by now;) But whatever. **fakir**Subj: My IPCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,mizan,star,vital,earwaxDate: Nov  4 00:16My son, Michael has moved back home for  a time, and so will be logging into the game from my ip.

It happened some time ago and i'm a bit fuzzy on the details, and at this point I do not care.  But... when faced with multiple seniors that caught him doing stupid, relatively minor things, he chose not to come clean but instead spread "political" crap accusing me and others of framing him, among other things.  He didn't even keep his story straight and never apologized to anyone.  This part- I do remember clearly as I was often the target of "politics".  He went down by a thousand cuts and can stay down as far as i'm concerned.  If he wants to be a shardak guild wiz- sure. But no levels greater than 30, so he can't see other wizs' files, and can remain focused on his own stuff.  If he hadn't been such an ass about things in the past and just said "yeah i goofed" i would have a more favorable opinion, but too bad.  Just my own "political" opinion. **worm**Subj: sheeshCc: (To: mizan) boltar,fred,pestilence,vertebraker,angel,wormDate: Aug 13 01:59exactly what the subject says.. sheesh, i love mizan, i wouldnt have his babies.. but only because i'm far prettier than him. but i know the story, i've heard a more straight forward version. one from everyone involved on the 'guilty' side. there is one simple fact i will beat until the end. mizan has code used all the time,  so does he. they're both good guys in my book. they could both do whatever they wanted, even desting me, zapping me, jailing and or banning me.. and i'd just be glad it was one of them. one of our own.. one who's been here for the long haul. i'm not taking sides.. and i'm only some lowly player, but i think he deserves respect. and everyone slips up. cheating? seriously? .. i could toss names but i wont. but there are others who've cheated.. and would never be punished. Pestilence has been.. and if you all knew the whole truth behind why, you'd all (Mizan included) shrug it off. No, he didnt come clean.. and now he's paid.

Not sure what's causing the bug, specifically - probably the attacker object isn't getting properly passed to the weapon function.  This won't really be fixed until there's a better way of implementing additional attacks - something else I've been looking into but haven't done anything about yet. **highlander**Subj: heal scrollsCc: (To: boltar) star,angel,illarion,mizan,shinshi,fred,vertebrakerDate: Oct 19 21:29i just had 5 full heal scrolls get destroyed in my casa room.  is that supposed to do that or what.... get back to me please with resolution if any. thanks **rumplemintz**Subj: AFKCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,vital,angel,khrell,sparrow,star,mizanDate: Oct 28 12:23I'm switching jobs so I might be away from the game until I get settled.

I want to granularize (sp?) some code and it makes logical sense to me to have them in directories that define what the modules are.  My goal isn't to change anything right away, but to bring some existing stuff up to date and make it easier to work with. The end result as far as players are concerned will not change - at least not with existing stuff.  Take for example /room/room.c - our base room object.  It contains all the code for exits, descriptions, light, properties, etc... but soem other objects use descriptions, properties.  Why not make those basic modules, that anything can inherit and use instead of having to code them into the base object.  These would fall into the /basic directory, as basic modules.  Anything that inherits multiple modules and defines some more functions that are unique to itself would become an example of a complex object (such as the room)  We could continue to keep these in /obj or /room - but i think those are better suited for actual items or rooms, not modules or base objects.  Of course there would have to be backwards compatibility built in or none of this matters.  Keep in mind i'm not trying to change the way anything that already exists works.  I'm just trying to lay some framework so that when we decide (if!) to move to LD that there is a solid foundation to work with for adding NEW stuff.  Hope that explains it!  Any questions let me know. **rumplemintz**Subj: LD / QuestsCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,fred,illarion,vital,mizanDate: Dec 15 01:16All quests that are currently in game have been fixed/verified on LD I ran my test char through all of them that are still active.  Any idea how far we got with testing the guilds?  I'd feel comfortable with switching over to LD during the hardware migration if we have the guilds and quests working.  **rumplemintz**Subj: simul_efun_ldmudCc: (To: boltar) mizan,vertebraker,illarion,fredDate: Dec 15 16:54Forget that last one, here's the correct one... kept thinking i was in a full editor last time  ;)  From/Current:  object * all_inventory(mixed ob) {   object obj;   if(stringp(ob))   {     call_other(ob, "???");     obj = find_object(ob);   }   else      obj = ob;   return efun::all_inventory(obj); }  To/New:  (allows calling all_inventory without arg)  object *all_inventory(mixed ob) {   object obj;    if (!ob)     return efun::all_inventory();    else if (stringp(ob))   {     call_other(ob, "???");     obj = find_object(ob);   }   else     obj = ob;    return efun::all_inventory(obj); }   Hope that makes sense, thanks! **rumplemintz**Subj: simul_efun_ldmud.cCc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,illarion,fred,mizanDate: Dec 15 23:00One small change to that last email.  Since all_inventory assumes this_object, have to pass previous_object() if no arg...  so    if (!ob)     return efun::all_inventory(previous_object());  instead of the   if (!ob)     return efun::all_inventory();  that i had stated in previous mailings.  Sorry about that. **mizan** Re:   LD / QuestsCc: (To: rumplemintz) boltar,vertebraker,fred,illarion,vital,mizanDate: Dec 15 23:35Hey all, I just wanted to keep everyone abreast of the situation with the hardware upgrade. The current server is a traditional Linux server running the CentOS 4.7 32 bit distribution. This is an 'end of life' product which has been superceded by the CentOS 5.x series.  What I am planning on doing is replacing the server with a newer machine that runs a hardware assist virtual machine environment. In English this means that the new machine will be hosting several virtual servers, one of which will be a dedicated machine just for Nirvana. These virtual machines run completely independent of one other. The changes will be imperceptible for most of you, but what is happening under the hood will be a major change. I am going to try migrating the OS to Ubuntu Server 9.10, 32 bit.  This will be a gradual process. First I need to move the server to the datacenter, the timeframe of which will be sometime in January.  Once the hardware is installed, the process of trying to move things over will start, and will be the 'slow-and-steady' parallel process.  I have zero intention of 'hot swapping' the old machine with the new without having anything tested. Things are subject to change but I will keep everyone posted.  Thanks, -tij **highlander**Subj: quests and qptsCc: (To: boltar) illarion,mizan,star,fred,aingeal,vertebraker,highlanderDate: Jan  7 00:28ok i have done 2 quests tonight and only got credit for one of them in my points i did the phastasm quest and got 15 points for that one and i just completed the fiendsville quest i started with 106 qps and only have 121 phantasm quest is worth 15 and the fiendsville quest is 13 so i should have 134 qpts correct **boltar** Re:   quests and qptsCc: (To: highlander) illarion,mizan,star,fred,aingeal,vertebraker,highlanderDate: Jan  8 08:34goto to the clinic and register.
