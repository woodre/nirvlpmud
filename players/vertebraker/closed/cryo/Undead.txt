				[...:The Undead Guild:...]
                       Guild Summary by Vertebraker
                             Updated: 5.24.04

  The Undead is a "unique-ability" oriented guild, whose powers cost
hit points, spell points, and assorted other minutia. Each member is a
brother in the whole scheme of the "Undead", but there isn't a real
official guild hierarchy or anything like that [i.e., no guild channel,
no guild teleports, or any of that nonsense]. The Undead are creatures
of vast hunger, so they often have PK in mind, because the corpses of
players taste much better than stupid monsters.
  The Undead are intended to be very competitive in PK because of the
myriad disadvantages they must endure being creatures of death and
decay. They also are fairly strong fighters, although certainly not
the best in Nirvana. They start off weaker than any other guild
in Nirvana, but obtain some of the best and most unique powers
available.
  An extremely difficult guild to get the hang of, the Undead are
unconventional in the extremes. Those who join will either love it or
hate it, and the drawbacks are not kind in the slightest...
A newbie player unless helped during his infancy faces practically
nil chance at success.

Requirements for joining:
  Players must be >= L5 [hopefully larer]. Those who may initiate
  are both guild wizards and players who have been appointed by
guild wizards.

Disadvantages:
 [1] No mini guilds.
 [2] No non-guild pets. [They do not obtain a pet until rank 3.]
     *Pets are scared of the undead.
 [3] Fixed attrib loss. It is impossible to raise one's willpower,
    piety, intelligence, OR charisma over the rank of 1. This
    will have longterm repercussions through the myriad amount
    of items that have been coded that take attribs into effect.
 [4] Some abilities require both SPs AND HPs to perform.
     Players can die by using abils that cost HP.
 [5] Cost to max guild: 15.75 MILLION xp.
 [6] All abilities have some chance of failure in them.
     They still swipe HP/SP if they do fail.
 [7] Hunger. Undead have an insatiable hunger for fresh corpses.
     If this hunger is not abated, they begin to eat themselves.
     Undead players will literally chew their arms, legs, (and head)
     off. This leads to temporary restriction of abilities as well
     as a massive loss in HP/SP. Players grow less hungry as they
     advance in ranks as long as they keep killing and eating.
 [8] Extremely difficult low rank raising.
      *The first rank, mistform, cannot wield weapons nor wear
       armor AT ALL. It only has a random(20) spell_object()
       with which to do damage. This spell_object() is only
       usable AT rank 1.
      *The second rank, skeleton, cannot wear armor save a shield.
       Its only method of attack besides its weapon is detaching
       its own bodyparts, which may be caught by its targets
       who may hold onto them indefinitely [or til they are
       slain]. Detaching ones bodyparts denies the possibility
       of certain abilities, however...
      *The undead does not get a reliable attack spell
       until rank4 [when it has already invested 3.75 mil xp].
 [9] Equipment rotting.
      Undeads have a permanent curse on their character where
      all items that they carry, even in a bag, will rot
      and eventually destruct. They spread this curse to
      all objects, even if touched for only a second. This
      curse NEVER goes away but is abated through periodic
      guild ranks. Equipment that is worn and wielded
      is affected nearly DOUBLE due to its close proximity
      to all those festering sores and wounds :)
      This also depreciates the value of the item.
      Also, these items cannot be saved. Which means
      Undead have NO savable eq.
      [SAMPLE #s:]
                 -per worn/wielded eq-
       Rank      Avg Secs           Minutes
        1         750                12.5
        4         3000               50
        8         6000               100 [1h40m]
                   -per other item-
       Rank      Avg Secs           Minutes
        1         1350               22.5
        4         5400               90 [1h30m]
        8         10800              180 [3h]
 [10] Damage from infusion.
      Other players may cause MASSIVE damage to Undead
      through healing or other method of infusion.
      Those who heal the Undead player will actually
      do (2*healing_amt + random(amt)) other|good dmg.
      It is quite conceivable that a vengeful higher level
      Healer could instablick an Undead.  In addition,
      the Undead will take considerable constant other|good 
      damage while its infusion remains above 0.  This
      is the major weakness of the Undead.  This never
      depreciates no matter the guild rank.
 [11] Adding Experience.
      Undead do NOT gain experience from partying with players
      other than fellow Undead or Vampires. EVER. Seeking out
      someone to powerlevel them will be extremely difficult.
 [12] Random Attrib Loss.
      Since Undeads are constantly decaying, they face constant
      loss of their physical attributes (the ones that AREN'T
      already set at 1...) ...
      The formula looks like this:
        - if(!random((luck/5 + rank)*400)) EVERY heartbeat.
      This is a constant curse which again, never totally goes
      away but slightly depreciates with time.
 [13] Constant HP/SP decay.
      Unlike the living players of Nirvana, Undead constantly
      decay. They do not heal in the slightest.
      They lose 4 - rank/2 HP & SP per autoheal() call in
      player.c, which is currently every 10 beats.
 [14] Mudkids.
      The Undead may not reproduce because in realistic terms
      this would produce some f'd up looking kids.  I don't
      currently feel like playing with this feature so I'm
      leaving it out.
 [15] Alcohol.
      The Undead can't drink alcohol. Have you ever seen
      a wasted zombie? Didn't think so. Alkie has no fx.
      [Note: I haven't seen a zombie eat splooge or drink
       lemonade either, but I don't feel like having
       any more friggin' drawbacks... SHEESH]
 [16] Death on joining, no xp brought in.
      When joining the guild, the player must be REBORN.
      Therefore, they must die first. They take a real
      death, after which any extra xp they may have is sucked
      away.  NO extra experience may be brought into the guild
      in any way.
 [17] Player level advancement. Requires a certain
      player level to use ranked abilities (denoted below).

The Good Stuff:
  With all the drawbacks to the Undead, only the real 'core
players will likely be able to survive. Therefore, it is fitting
that the guild be powered appropriately and thematically.
Abilities in the undead are quite unique and unlike any other guild
on Nirvana and wizards who advised to consider the extreme drawbacks
of the guild before they pass judgment on any abilities contained
therein. With that in mind...

Advantages:
 [1] 100% Resistance in Poison.
    -This is theoretical entirely. Instead of a guild 'cure'
     ability which would make no sense, the Undead gob checks for
     a poison on the player every beat. If present, it's gone.
     Also, the undead has a 100% resistance to the other|poison
     dmg type. Hey, they're corpses reborn.
 [2] Dark sight.
    -Since the Undead were born from darkness and death,
     they can see in it. No lights required in this guild.
 [3] Increased stuff/soak detox.
    -The Undead's natural metabolism increases because they're
     inherently rotting.  - (1+random(rank/2)) soak/stuff a beat.
 [4] Guild hall.
    -If multiple undead or vampires hook up in the secret crypt
     within the guild hall, their health regenerates faster.
     However, the entire guild hall is open and ppl can be PK'd
     if they aren't at the keyboard.
 [5] Vampires.
    -Undead have numerous abilities mainly for the benefit
     of Vampires. Such as drain_blood, revive, dim, etc.
     Also many powers ALWAYS work on vampires, or DON'T,
     depending on the power. They have a rather makeshift
     unofficial alliance with the Vampire guild.
