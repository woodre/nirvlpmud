Chapter I.   Storyline.

"In the beginning, there was light."

The Creation of the Universe was marked by intense debate in
the internal sanctums of the Higher Order. The gods' distinct
personalities clashed with each other with sometime alarming
results. Incapable of harming each other, the gods decided to
often end their intellectual duels with a new endgame: they
created warriors to fight in their image against each other.

The consequence of these divine chess matches were the
creations of immortal beings with varying levels of power and desire:
the Order of Wizards, the vile demi-god Shardak, the
elemental Lord Omni, and Mortus the High Necromancer to name
just a few. Because of the gods' omnipotence, each advancement
of a piece (Shardak's destruction of the elvish city of Mul'gar, e.g.)
was met by an opponent's block (the sealing of the Great City of
Phengala by the Elementals).

As one would expect, such well-played strategy would often
leave the gods bored and indifferent to the ways of men.
Tiring of the day-to-day business of running an infinite
empire, the gods created avatars to represent themselves
on their "playing fields". These avatars were known as angels.

Like popular myth and religion, these true angels had wings.
But certainly no halos. These angels were bloodthirsty
warriors incapable of emotion, their entire souls dedicated
to destruction of their deity's enemies.

As the gods allied themselves among each other, their angels
too chose their allegiances and formed too separate societies:

the light angels  and
the dark angels.

The light angels were dedicated to restoring the purity of
the Universe and preventing the corruption of the dark side
to intrude into the ways of men. They obliterated necromantic
magics and the ways of the demons and undead. They exorcised
spectres and cast light into the world where darkness had
long taken root. They alone imprisoned Shardak into his
resting place and pushed the Shadowbeasts into separate dimensions.
They banished the dark fae magiks and forged holy essence
into legendary weapons of destruction. 

The dark angels were the brethren of chaos and disorder. Their
role was servant to evil. Wherever they traveled, decay and
shadow followed. The sun was obscured by the darkness of their
souls, and the earth rotted beneath their feet. They slew
men and animals alike, without remorse or trepidation.  They
devoured the souls and moved on to destroy more life. The dark
angels were responsible for the extinction of the treants
in the First War of Sin'tara and the elimination of that goodly
realm entirely, as well as the slaying of the Elementals.

As the realms of Nirvana began to form, the chess match for
the gods had ended.  A stalemate had of course held over the
game for some time, and the gods were all too ready to dispense of
it when Boltar cast light on his first creation.

The angels, now useless, were eradicated by the gods in an event
known as "The Great Purging". However, the demi-god Shardak
knew of the true value of the angels and willed their souls
into his possession, even in his ancient slumber.  His magik
bound their souls into small stones which he hid in his earthen
tomb away from the prying eyes of the gods who had long
ago forgotten about him. He bided his time and waited.

Shardak's seeming omniscience was well-rewarded with the catastrophic
nuclear blast that created the Wastelands.  His prison walls were
shattered, and the stones were inadvertently fused with nuclear
radioactivity, causing the birth of new slaves for His will.
These golems were neither man nor angel, but rather monsters.
However, deep within them burned the power of the gods, longing
to be awakened. They dug his network of tunnels and channeled
their energy into him.

As Shardak was repelled the first time, the golems were released
and took umbrage in the foothills of Snow Mountain.  As a group,
they braved its heights and creatures.  They reached the pinnacle
and spoke with the ancient wizard Glarvinthal.  Amazed to hear
of their resilience, Glarvinthal at once began researching how
to reverse Shardak's lasting enchantment.  Though they were no
longer mentally bound to their lord, their physical forms were still
of mud and rock.  After years of research, Glarvinthal finally
managed to expel their souls from their forms and cast them into
the Elemental Plane.  There, their energies mixed with the life
and elements swirling throughout, and they emerged whole again.

The War of the Angels followed as each side's core differences
manifested themselves time and time again.  Nearly all angels were
slain in this conflict, with only two angels left, each representing
the light and the dark respectively.  While seeking each other,
the two lone angels attempted to enlist Glarvinthal's help once
again. Fearing the end of the amazing and mythical angel race
forever, Glarvinthal tricked both of them.  He offered each one
of them an instant teleport to their enemy.  Blindly accepting
the good wizard in faith, each angel in turn was the subject
of a magical spell.  However, the spell caused the angels'
souls to rupture and tear.  Much of their powers were weakened
by what was in truth a capturing spell.  Glarvinthal fused their
essence to his robes and searched for a way to restore the
races once again.

He found it in the lost books of the ancient order of dark mages.
Drinking the blood of gods and eating the heart of a demon,
the ancient wizard cast an encoded incantation to grant himself
the power to create new angels. Fearing their numbers and another
genocide, this time he created only six and spread them out
around the realms of Nirvana.  He destructed the essence from
his robes and allowed the angels to propagate as they wished.
