1] OVERVIEW -

 My new area is out near the southern forests, starting with
a small forest area [~/swamp/forest/] linked to my castle [castle.c],
stretching into a small village with a few interesting items
[~/swamp/village/] where a little girl has gone missing.
The town elder [~/NPC/juribel] drops hints that the girl
is in the swamp, but does not no for sure.  What the player
does not know is that the girl is already dead, as result
of a changeling <a shape-shifter> attack.  What this provides
is a theme/mini-quest for the player to delve into, hunting
for the girl.  Also, themewise, this area is well-crafted,
and has thematic links to Zeus's area.

 As far as the swamp goes, that is the meat of the area.
Originally I made the swamp and intended it to be a stand-alone
area, but I thought up the idea of the village and figured
it would be a bit more thematic than the standard "swamp"
exit at my castle ;).  Movement in the swamp is very limited,
it checks stealth vs random(25) just_to_move.  With
half of the rooms no-teleport and all of the rooms pk, this
is very deadly.  Also, 1/3 of the time that moving fails,
random(-10) heal_self dmg is called on the player [he trips].
So it is very taxing...  The monsters are random [SEE SECTION III]
so players cannot just go to a room and expect a kill, they are practically
forced to wander.

 The swamp is a very unique area, and I hope you will enjoy.
