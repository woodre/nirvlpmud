PROJECTS:
   Apartment: 100% and in game (Have you met your maker?)
   Neo Symbiote guild refurbishment/reopening: 100% and in game (Make me proud!)
   Movie theater area: 52% and still occasionally working
   
Accepting ideas for new, modest areas, any level range. Must be very unique ideas or something that would attract the masses to come play it.
Still just playing the game as a player mostly, when I am actually on. If you don't know me when I'm on as another name, there's a reason :)
