          Chip's Room Corrections Part #2
          
          
     Ok, guess I will start with the bad news first.
     
     1)   You have 40 rooms and 24 are apartments that are the exact
          same. That is a bit of an issue.  It is one thing to have
          2 or 3 similar rooms but 24 exact rooms is too much.  You
          need to make some modifications to the rooms descriptions.
          One Idea would be for each floor have a different desc for 
          the rooms.  Also each room does not have to be completely
          different. If you have 4 sentences then make one or two of
          them a different line and not just the last line with 
          direction.....  Get with me if you have any questions
          on this, I know it is a big one and I did cover it with 
          Fred first before I sent it to you. 
        
     2)   The second issue is the use of "YOU" in your descriptions.
          You can't use it, sorry. It was hard for me to get use to 
          as well. I know some old areas still have it but it has not
          been allowed for a long time. A simple fix could be 
          "This is" or "It appears this is" just NOT "You stand".
          
     File: /players/chip/room/apartment/apt1.c thru /apt24.c
          
      --Add "bed" to your items with a description
      --In items "newspaper" it say "It is wall wadded up" I think you 
        ment "It is all wadded up" else I dont know what it means
      --Holes is worded awkwardly.  You could try:
        The walls and ceiling have many openings, which explains the debris cluttering the floor
    
      File: /players/chip/room/apartment/enter.c
      
      --remove the YOU
      --fix holes in items, same as above
      --spelling should be blatantly, not blatently
      
      File: /players/chip/room/apartment/f1h1.c thru f1h3.c
      
      --remove the YOU
      --fix holes in items, same as above
      --spelling should be blatantly, not blatently
      --you have a run on sentence in the long desc
        put a period after "nostrils" delete ", and"
        then cap The.
      
      File: /players/chip/room/apartment/f1stairs.c
      
      --remove the YOU
      --In items "banister" remove should be removed

      --spelling should be blatantly, not blatently
      --you have a run on sentence in the long desc

        then cap The.
      
      File: /players/chip/room/apartment/f2stairs.c 
      
      --remove the YOU
      --fix holes in items, same as above
      --Add "banister" to items
      
      File: /players/chip/room/apartment/f3h1.c  thru /f3h4.c
      
      --remove the YOU
      --fix holes in items, same as above
      --spelling should be blatantly, not blatently
      --you have a run on sentence in the long desc

        then cap The.
      
      File: /players/chip/room/apartment/f3lndlrd.c
      
      --In the lon desc take out "very" before slightly 
      --fix holes in items, same as above
      
      File: /players/chip/room/apartment/f3stairs.c  
      
      --remove the YOU
      --fix holes in items, same as above
      --Add "banister" to items
      
      
      Now I said I was starting with the bad news so I am guessing you are wondering 
      where the good news is.  I had Fred review the mob file we worked on and Fred
      was fine with the hp,wc,ac, and coin level.   :) 
      
      The next file I create will be on the mobs for grammar and spelling
      
      Correct make all correction I have given you up to this point and I
      should have the mob file soon. once all correction are made I will
      make one last sweep to see if I missed anything or if any other 
      correction need to be made, then we can go to the final approval.
      
      Any question just ask....  trying to knock it out quick for you.
