            ROOM CORRECTIONS for Chip's APT's
            
	OK before I start just a couple universal items.
	   
	   1) Add a header to all files.
	
	   2) All files should be uniform, neat and clean.
	      this will make it easier for the approval wiz
	      to get through your code and easier for you to
	      go back later to know what you did. 
	      
	   3) All object files (monsters, rooms, items) will have
	      as the first line:     #include "/sys/lib.h"
          This is the standard definitions file for code.  It
          contains the definitions for ansi color and the lib
          inherits, among other things for the LD conversion
          that is being worked on.  We need to add it in before
          the conversion.

       4) I noticed that you did not keep the "items" set up the same.
          They need yo be formatted the same way in each file.  follow 
          the format below for all files.
      
          I am giving an example of a good format for your first room  
          /players/chip/room/apartment/apt1.c
          Notice I moved the mob in between ::reset(arg); and if(arg) return;
          This is for it to be called correctly.  
          Also, spacing from the left is important. When spacing, space in 2's.
