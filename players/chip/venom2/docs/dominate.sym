Dominate will allow you to force your will upon
a fallen monster that has been previously knocked 
unconscious.  By implanting a piece of Dark 
Matter into the brain of the creature, you will
gain dominance over it and it will become your
pet slave. This pet cannot be controlled beyond 
the ability to 'destroy' it.  It will follow you
around and fight alongside you. Damage taken
by the pet slave cannot be repaired.
