Create Bag is a formidable ability that will
allow you to shape Dark Matter into a deep
bag that can hold a large number of items, and
cannot be grabbed up by other players. Beware
though, just because they can't grab the bag
off the ground doesn't mean they can't loot
things from it while it's laying there.

Cost: 150 Mp and 150 Sps
Skill Level: Creation 4

Usage: 'createbag'
