TO DO:

Artos reported: just a suggestion, on the convert exp command, perhaps put an ability to type convert all, and it'll convert all free exp to the guild

Fervens reported: i think there should be a wep2 spell in the blank LV5 ability slot in combat, cost 60sps, MY idea is that is should do something like form the unarmed arm into 2 weapons and do two attacks for the 60sps, only useable if you are being attacked and have special bonuses in hypermode, mabey something like more weapons being formed or the weapons hitting more than once each

Fervens reported: again i refresh that there should be a some sort of light ability, it could take the blank spot in lv4 creation, like have the tentacles glow with matter, have it have an upkeep cost and call it shine, or something like i originally said and have a tentacle assigned to light and have it 'feel' the room and report the findings to you, call it feel obviously ;)

Fervens reported: i have thought of an ability to make as the lv6\lv6 ability for control and combat, dual wield, only useable while being attacked and have special bonues in hypermode, extra chances to hit per round or something

*Fix up /players/chip/closed/deepbag.c  so it works the way it should
