The Cinemas will be a staging area. Several concepts:

1. Cinemas will be a standard low-mid level area with mobs to kill/items & coins to gain. 
2. Heals will be available and likely additional toys/items.
3. Tickets to view movies will be for sale at the ticket booth. Tickets will be generic, offering entry to any movie.
4. Movie tickets will allow the players to enter the movie - 
	conceptually becoming part of the movie. They will "progress" through the movie with cast members and will be able to
	interact with cast members to a degree. Progress will not be saved - if a player dies their corpse will be sent 
	to the lost and found area in the theater. Whether or not there will be a timed reentrance hasn't been decided.
	The thought behind this is that for players who successfully make it through the entire movie, there will be some
	type of quest reward at the end.
5. The first movie to "play" will be The Cube, a Canadian horror flick. I have several ideas of movies to follow, but 
	they will NOT be huge block busters.
6. Movie posters with movie descriptions will be posted in the theater lobby.
7. Movie 'realms' will be coded as accurately, with as many details to the movie as possible. If there are puzzles to 
	solve for the cast - those puzzles should translate to the realm also.  
7. The game room will also offer opportunities for additional areas - wherein the player can "play" the video games. 
	Conceptually, if they successfully play the game they will be able to kill the "mob boss" at the end of the game.
	These will be mini-realms and may possibly spin a quest.
8. Many added extras to add a unique twist. All will be for players who explore and will not necessarily be announced.
9. ASCII will thematically be used, just for kicks, as it fits into the theme.
