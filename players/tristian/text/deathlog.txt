  A long stairway leeds northbound deeper into the pyramid.
The smells of rotting flesh, and blood swarm over the room.
The walls are covered  with large, intricate cobwebs.  Looming
columns line the eastern wall.  Dust has settled effortlessly
on the floor.
    There are five obvious exits: east, southeast, south, northeast and stairway

Crip tells you: come pray i will hand you the corpses

[Power Ranger] Someone says: the spell hit u the same hb you left i would say


As you can see i was clearly in the room adjacent to the spirit and died the next round. I got the hunting message from the spirit which should indicate the fight was over, or that i had run in time to prevent dying.  If i am mistaken on this, an explaination as to how this could happen would be good.
