1.	Main description:  Try not to use "you" (e.g. "You have entered...",
"you see a table...", "You think you have....")

2.	Main description:  The first sentence is a run-on sentence.  The 
logical sentence break is between "area" and "you see a table...."  Also,

2/8/03	Completion of walk-through.




ALL rooms -- be sure to even up the length of the lines in your descriptions.
Some are hanging over.
Also, you may want to consider putting in some combat chats for your mobs.

g_room9.c:
Recommended changes or errors:

1.	Main description:  The first sentence needs to be split into two
sentences.  (The break should be after "bare here.")  The description also 
refers to a corral (singular) in the first sentence, then to corrals (plural)
in the second and third sentences.  
	The sentence beginning "Some tents stand over...." should be split
into two sentences.  (The break should be after "by the corrals" and a new
sentence started with "These tents are....")  The second half is also not
grammatically correct.  Hrm...it's probably easier just to change the second 
sentence as follows:  "Some tents stand over by the corral which are slightly
larger than the tents in the rest of the camp."
	The third sentence either needs 1) a semicolon in the place of the
comma, or 2) "and" inserted before "even the ever...."  Also, "by corrals" 
should be "by the corrals".

2.	You need an item description for "water troughs".

3.	In your main description, you describe the troughs as "water
troughs"; however, in the item "troughs" you describe them as "food or
water troughs".  These need to be consistent.

4.	In the description for the item "carcass", "grizzly" should be "grisly".
Also, "half eaten" should be "half-eaten".


5.	You should have the wolf clone the wolf pelt when it dies, rather 
than having it carry the pelt.  (It's not realistic to have it carry its

own pelt.)

6.	(two typos)  The wolf's description should read:  "A snarling wolf 
whose rider lies dead on the ground."




7.	You need to even up the line length of the main description.  ("Over"
		hangs over past the rest.)


g_room10.c:
Recommended changes or errors:
2.	Main description:  The first sentence is a run-on sentence, and the
second half is inconsistent with the first (i.e. bare and containing practice
dummies).  A better alternative might be:  "The clearing is bare, save for some
practice dummies that are off to one side."  
	The second sentence is also two sentences stuck together.  You could
1) restructure the sentence as follows: "Straw that probably came from inside
the dummies is strewn about the ground."  or 2) substitute a semicolon for
the comma.
	"scribed" should be "inscribed".

3.	There is a type mismatch in the description for the item "clearing"
(e.g. the hard packed dirt did not come from the foot traffic).  You might
try something like this instead:  "An open area where the ground is packed
hard from frequent foot traffic."

4.

5.	You need item descriptions for: practice dummies, ground, circle


g_room11.c
Recommended changes or errors:

1.	Eliminate "you" and "your" from the main description and the mob
descriptions.  

2.	The "listen" description is in conflict with the main description.

3.	Main description: The first sentence is a run-on sentence.  The natural
break is between "area" and "the camp".


4.	The "listen" description is inconsistent with the main room description.

5.	The description for item "tent":  The first sentence is a run-on
sentence.  The natural breaks are between "days" and "it probably", then
between "caravan" and "chanting".  Again, stylistically it would flow better
to say "blows the flap open" rather than "blows open the flap".

6.	You need item descriptions for: flap, ground, scrub grasses, grasses.






g_tent2.c

1.	Main description: There should be a comma between "hot" and "and".
"Hang" should be "hangs".  "the contents" is referring to "a low cot" --
if you mean that the balls of fire are shedding light over the contents of
the room, you need to add "of the room".

2.	The description for item "tent" doesn't match the main room description.
(The item description is in plural, rather than singular.)  Also, eliminate 
"you" from the description.  "previous ones" doesn't make sense from inside 
the tent.  Perhaps "other tents in the goblin camp" might work better.

3.	You may want to add "smell" to this room.

4.	You need item descriptions for: fire

5.	In the item description for "books", eliminate "you".  Also, there 
are typos ("dont" rather than "don't" and "thier" rather than "their"). 
Perhaps this would work better:  "Spell books, written in the gutteral 
language of the goblin.  They have little value to one who does not read 
their language."

6.	In the item description for "scrolls", you have a run-on sentence.  
The break should be between "goblin" and "The figures...."  (Also, you need 
a comma after "page".)

7.	The pentagram is uneven at one point on the right-hand side.  
(Nifty idea, though!)

8.	In the goblin wizard's chat, "breathe" should be "breath".

9.	In the goblin wizard's description:  "mutting" should be "muttering".
"breathe" should be "breath".  The second sentence is a run-on sentence.  
You can either: a) split it into two sentences (...high quality.  He is 
muttering....), or b) put a comma between "quality" and "and" (this 
technically fixes the sentence structure, but is less readable than 
splitting it into two sentences.)

10.	Velvet robes description:  You have a run-on sentence.  You can either 
break the sentence after "robes" (where you have the comma) (preferred), or 
after "clean".



g_room12.c
1.	Main description:  (First sentence) "sparrodic" should be "sporadic".
(Second sentence) You need a comma between "tents" and "and".

2.	You need item descriptions for: grasses, cook fires, stump

3.	You really should spell out your single-digit numbers (i.e. one fire 
rather than 1 fire)(This is in your description for item "fires".)

4.	In both item descriptions for "trash" and "debris", you need to 
uncapitalize "garbage".

5.	The description for item "forest" does not describe how the forest 
looks. Eliminate the use of "your"-- "tower overhead" would work just as well.
Also, there is a typo in the first sentence ("dazzaling" should be "dazzling".)

6.	In the description for item "picket", "stick" should be "sticks".  
Eliminate the use of "you".

7.	In the description for the mobs: "lookin" should be "looking".  
Eliminate the use of "you".


g_room13.c
1.	Main description:  The first sentence is a run-on sentence.  The 
sentence break should be after "...across the area."  The next part of the 
sentence doesn't make sense -- what does the dirt share the landscape with?  
This should be a full, grammatically correct sentence.  "uptight" is not 
the correct usage for that word in the last sentence -- did you mean next 
to the tree line?

2.	In the description for item "grass":  "sparrodic" should be "sporadic".

3.	In the description for item "stream", there is a run-on sentence.  
It should break between "water" and "buckets".  Also, "laying" should be
"lying".

4.	In the description for item "trees", there is an extra period at 
the end of the sentence.  Also, delete the comma and insert "that have" 
between "pines" and "probably".

5.	You need an item description for: tree, fence

6.	In the description for the goblin: "looking" instead of "lookin".



g_room14.c
1.	Main description: The first sentence is a run-on sentence.  The
logical break is between "camp" and "small trees".  Typo -- "brids" should
be "birds" and "farther" should be "further".  "Amongst" should be "among".

2.	Description for item "forest" -- same as above.  It doesn't describe
what the forest looks like, and eliminate "your" from the description.

3.	Description for item "trees":  "ten" instead of "10".

4.	You need item descriptions for:  grasses

5.	The description for item "grass" is inconsistent with the main
room description.

6.	Eliminate "you" from the description for item "picket".

7.	In the description for "smell", it should be "waft" instead of "wafts".


g_room15.c
1.	Eliminate "you" from the main description.

2.	Description for item "grass": eliminate "you".  Also, you should make
this a grammatically correct sentence.  Perhaps: The taller grass, about
waist high, makes a perfect hiding area for a goblin.

3.	Description for item "trees": see above.

4.	You need item descriptions for: zones, kill zones, lines, sight lines

5.	Description for item "forest" -- same as above.  It doesn't describe
what the forest looks like, and eliminate "your" from the description.

6.	Description for "goblin sentry": "lookin" should be "looking".

between "days" and "rust".

2.	Descriptions for "north", "east" and "west": Eliminate "you".  

3.	Description for "south":  Run-on sentence.  Break between "goblin
camp" and "there is".  Eliminate "you".  There should be a comma after
"corrals".  Sentence break again after "fire pit."  

4.	Description for "goblin sentry": "lookin" should be "looking".
Eliminate "you" from the description.
