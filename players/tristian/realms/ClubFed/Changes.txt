Changes for ClubFed.

/obj directory --

crack.c - 
  it should sell for 4,500 coins not 1,800.
  In the set_long() there should be a space between "the" and "'crack'"

eightball.c -
  You have set_name to "eight ball" and an add_alias to "eight ball" which
  is redundant so I changed your add_alias to "eightball".

  You have set_type and set_type_single as 'dopes' and 'dope'.  It's up to
  you but if you look at the eightball it lists "There are [3] 'dopes' remaining".
  To me 'shots' or 'hits' or something would make more sense.

  This should also sell for 4,500 coins instead of 1,800.

  In the set_long() there should be a space between "the" and "'dope'"
    
heroin.c -
  In the set_long() there should be a space between "the" and "'crank'"
  
  This should also sell for 4,500 coins instead of 1,800.

cig.c - 
  For the bartering of this I'd rather see you add something like 
  "joey_the_snitch" to the id() in joey.c and check for 
  present("joey_the_snitch", environment(this_player()))
  Just a more unique identifier.  Otherwise you have lazy asses like
  myself that just name my pet "joey" and I can barter them without
  actually having to find/goto the mob.

/mobs directory --

bank_fraud.c -
  I'm fine with messing around with wc/ac/hps on a mob but this is a
  pretty basic mob and should be strictly lvl 20.

blackmail.c - 
  Same as above, should be a lvl 20 mob.

counterfeiting.c -
  Same as above, should be a lvl 20 mob.
 
For ALL mobs.
  I'm guessing the above lvl changes are the case for ALL mobs so I'm 
  going to stop listing it.  Just set all the mobs to lvl 20.

  All the mobs have a spell msg about stabbing me with a shiv.  This is 
  thematic but once I kill them there is no shiv.  I suggest coding a 
  shiv.c to put in your /obj directory and clone it to all your mobs
  when they die in the same way you do the cigarettes.  Just make it a
  generic wc 15 or something with a value of like 700 coins.  These are 
  all basically 30-40k mobs but 5 cig's is only 2500 coins.  Adding in
  the shiv brings you up to 3,100 coins.  This however is still "low" 
  by most standards.  If that's how you want it that's fine.  Otherwise
  feel free to change the cigs to like 500+random(500) or something when
  you barter them.

/rooms directory --

court.c - 
  On the sign that you read you might want to change your 'Guilty' to 'guilty' 
  since your check only recognizes lower case.  Or add to your arg check. 
  if(arg == "guilty" || arg == "Guilty") return guilty();  Same theory with
  the not guilty and no contest.
  
  In your not_guilty_2_1() final should be finally.

Cell_B_10.c - 
  For 'call guard'.  Just for theme instead of just cloning the guard maybe
  just add a msg or along the lines of "A guard enters the cell and relocks
  the door behind him."  Just something explaining where he came from instead
  of just poof he's in the locked cell.

hall_A_shower.c -
  Same as Cell_B_10 note.

hall_B_shower.c -
  Same as Cell_B_10 note.

joey_cell.c -
  Change the 'list' and 'buy' to reflect change in heal prices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/mobs directory

guard.c -
  set lvl to 20 like the rest of the mobs.

  in the load_chat() Your should be You're

  the other load_chat() should be a load_a_chat() I think.  Seems like that would be when
  you're actually attacking him.

  long descript and some spells list things like billy club and mace.  Could do like
  the convicts idea and just make a generic of it to clone upon death like I mentioned
  with the shiv.

shower_con.c - 
  set lvl to 20.

  Maybe code and clone a bar of soap on these guys as well.

joey.c -
  Add to his id() something more unique joey_the_snitch, joey_prison_bitch, whatever just
  something unique for the trading of cigs.

  set lvl to 20.
