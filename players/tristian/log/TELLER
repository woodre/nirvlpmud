Thu Jul 23 22:01:52 2009 Feyth smiles brightly.  "I'm well, sweetie.  How are you tonight?"
Thu Jul 23 22:02:34 2009 Feyth tells you: FYI, it's rated G for awhile...I have a house full of kids (mine and my friend's 3 year old twins), with my husband on his way home and my friend coming to get the kids in the next hour.
Thu Jul 23 22:04:25 2009 Feyth sighs softly.  "All I can do is say I'm sorry.  I've had my hands mega-full for weeks now.  I haven't even had an hour to myself, let alone an hour ALONE to myself."
Thu Jul 23 22:06:31 2009 Feyth tells you: The second day of the child abuse seminar, unbeknownst to me, I was appointed to represent two kids in one of the worst cases of physical and sexual abuse in the past decade in our region.  Two kids under 5.
Thu Jul 23 22:06:41 2009 Feyth sighs.  "I've been unbelievably busy ever since."
Thu Jul 23 22:10:13 2009 Feyth shakes her head.  "No, sweetie, as in real life.  The youngest girl was beaten so badly....she fell asleep in my arms two days after the seminar when I visited her."
Thu Jul 23 22:23:37 2009 Feyth shakes her head.  "Yes, and no.  The criminal charges are just in the charging stage.  This is the proceeding where their children are removed from their custody, which happened as soon as it was discovered."
Thu Jul 23 22:23:45 2009 Feyth tells you: Oops, afk again.
Thu Jul 23 22:47:34 2009 Feyth tells you: I'm finally sane again, dear.  Sorry about that.
Thu Jul 23 23:00:00 2009 Feyth grins.  "FYI, Devon is my rl husband....just a head's up."
Thu Jul 23 23:26:57 2009 Feyth blinks.  "Who, my husband?  Have at it."  She winks at you.
Thu Jul 23 23:29:51 2009 Feyth winks playfully at you.
Thu Jul 23 23:38:07 2009 Feyth whispers, "Goodnight, lover."
Thu Jul 23 23:38:29 2009 Feyth kisses you gently, then whispers, "Sleep well, sexy."
