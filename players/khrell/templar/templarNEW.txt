mount types

 mule: lowest mount type.  Can't be mounted
       more or less a portable bag, but it
       will defend it self if attacked.
 
 warhorse: operates as the old standard templar
           horse.  except this one can and will
           fight in combat. (even if ridden)
 
 unicorn: (females only) Magical mount that can
          increase healing rates of all knights
          in the same room as it. Also it will
          fight in combat.  Can teleport to 
          the guild hall if needed.
          
 pagasas: (males only) magical mount that can
          increase healing rates of all knights
          in the sam eroom as it.  Will fight in
          combat to assist master, also can fly
          to 'remembered' rooms.
          
 wyvern: tempermental but fierce beasts that can
         fly.  Hard to tame and WILL eat any
         children that remain around it for too
         long of a time.
 
 griffin: Noble and ideal mount for a templar.
          Strong and fierce as well as loyal to
          its master/mistress.  When fully trained
          a griffin can scoop up a fallen owners 
          corpse and bring it to its masters side.
          
 drake: Greatist of the templar mounts.  Though
        powerful and strong, this mount requires
        intense devotion, and had a hearty appetite
        of food and treasure.  Also requires at least
        2x the experience to train.  Posessess a 
        natural AC/WC bonuses, also can breathe a
        stream of holyfire upon its foe.
 
 Mounts must be actively trained and will need at least 50,000
exps invested before they will allow someome to ride them.  The
mule being the exception.  Mounts do not have levels but have
stats.   

mount stats: Attack -  starts out at 5.  Also contributes to the
                       special abilities of the mount (if any) the
                       larger mounts will use their combat abilities
                       (if any) once they have over 10 in attack and
                       each point raises the WC of the mount by one 
                       point. 
                       5 - 10 costs 10k per point
                       11 - 20 costs 40k per point
                       21 - 25 costs 100k per point
                       
             Defense - starts out at 1 (also adds to hit recovery)
                       each five points will give one extra hit per HB
                       to the recovery of the mount.  Each point raises
                       the AC by 1
                       Also remember knights can get more AC for 
                       their mounts by forging barding.
                       NOTE: Barding does NOT aid in HP recovery.
                       1 - 5 costs 20k per point
                       6 - 10 costs 50k per point
                       11 - 15 costs 100k per point
                       
             Life -    starts out at 5 and each point trained
                       increases life by 10.  
                       5 - 10 costs 1k per point
                       11 - 15 costs 5k per point
                       16 - 20 costs 10k per point
                       21 - 30 costs 15k per point
                       30 - 40 costs 20k per point
