	A summary/overview of the next installment of the
Underways. (Previously the Goblincaves introduced some
of it.  This is another part of what will eventually
be a (hopefully) epic scale area.

	All rooms for this leg of the area are contained
within "/players/khrell/area/underways". All the
monsters are in "/players/khrell/monster/underways".
There are no weapons/armor/items to speak of here,but
additions to the Underways will introduce some.

There are only 19 rooms for this part and are labled/numbered
'undermdh1.c - undermdh19.c'. The mob (yes one mob entry) is
a random level, hits, WC/AC critter and name is also random.
It is not a filler. the mob is called 'golrnd.c'.

The area is a ruined dwarven hold in the Underways populated
entirely by the golem servants of it's former occupants.
