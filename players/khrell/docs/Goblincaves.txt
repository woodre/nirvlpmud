   This is a brief summary of the first area coded by Khrell.
   
   First off I have placed all rooms in a file folder;
     "/players/khrell/area/goblins.."
   Rooms begins with gobrm1 and go through gobrm16, as I do not
   feel it necessary to give them super long or complicated names.
   
   Secondly, I have placed mobs, armors, weapons etc. in separate 
   folders in the different dirs.
   
   "/players/khrell/armors/goblins.." - contains all armors
   "/players/khrell/weapons/goblins.." - contains all weapons
   "/players/khrell/monster/goblins.." - contains all mobs 
   
   Current difficulty standing for the area is about level 10+ for
Players, solo.   
   
   The theme if the area may seem vague at first but eventually with
the addition of more areas it will be more and more clear.  The basic
idea is a very large mountain willed with many dangers and surprises.
First part is primarly goblins, and their mineworks.  Eventually there
will be additions that are part of the 'story' for the area.  The mobs
are generally mid levels.  There is one higher leveled mob that is 
deeper within.  It's more or less 'crude' by current standards of the
high traffic areas.  At this time my skill of coding is rather limited,
but with work etc, I'll put in more, and tweak and modify current content
as needs be or see fit.
