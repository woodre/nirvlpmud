 
After a day of work, I put together a PC and log in via modem and
see what is by far the worst I've ever seen in 10 years
of mudding. make that nearly 12 years.
What is worse, is that people have believed him without so much as
talking to me. I find that very sad. They have damaged the mud, but
it will go on.

Relflex has written a long rambling piece of text of falsehoods in
order to assinate my character. 

]First, reflexes quotes are accurate, except he has left out their
]meaning. It was that I wasn't the out-of-touch person he thought I
]was. He wondered how I found out about him starting up a mud. Someone
]told me. Yes, people tell me things. heaven forbid that I actually
]have friends.
]
]2) Record every single action of all players at all times. I cannot
]believe anyone falls for such nonsense. While I suppose it may be
]technically possible, I dunno how. Even more perplexing is why? Honestly
]I don't give a crap what you people do so long as nobody complains
]to me.  I think that in the last 12 years, people would know this.
]Even if recorded, we know that reflex is lying, as no human could
]sort through such data, why would anyone want to? It would take
]weeks to go through a days worth of activity. If what reflex said were
]true and a person spend 24hrs a day on it, they might now be getting
]to january of 1993 falling further behind each day.
