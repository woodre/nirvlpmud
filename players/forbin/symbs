Symbiotes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview

The symbiote guild is one based on a symbiotic relationship between the
player (the host) and the symbiote mob.  Guild is joined by the player 
touching a ball of dark matter - as they do, the symbiote enters their
body and forms a bond.  Players will give their symbiote A name.  The
player will have no special powers until they 'changeform', letting the
symbiote cover them with darkmatter.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Drawbacks

 Randomly attack everything ... .
 
   ESPECIALLY other symbiotes ..
   
 1. Most abilities require the use of MP or matter points to use them.
    MP are gained from draining corpses or items and this amount is
    saved on the gobj over boot, etc. [essentially an added cost]
 2. Abilities require 'changeform'.  When unchanged, player receives no 
    special powers and cannot use the general mud spells.
 3. No mud pets or kids.  The symbiote is a jealous organism and will 
    fight at ALL costs for your total attention.
 4. No mini guilds.
 5. Major weakness to "other|fire".  [one and one half damage]
 6. Severe weakness to "other|sonic". [double damage]          
 7. Reduced SPs.
 8. Reduced spell point healing rate.
 9. Infusion harms the symbiote.
10. Take greater damage than normal players.
11. Extreme damage can cause player to revert to normal [quite painful
    to the symbiote and therefore the player as well]   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages

1. Increased WC.
2. Increased physical resistance. [10% res]
3. Major resistance to "other|mental". [75% resistance]
4. Increased HPs.
5. Increased hit point healing rate.

Abilities (given in general order acquired)

mimic other players temporairly.


changeform [costs sps and MPs]
  Allows symbiote to cover player with dark matter.  Most of the guild
  abilities do not work when player is not changed.  The exception is
  'absorb'.
say [auto ability]
  When changed, says and tells are changed to support the host/symbiote
  relationship, i.e. I = We, Me = Us, etc.  [mainly thematic]
absorb <living> | <item> [no cost] <automatic>    
  Allows player to absorb an enemy into the symbiote at 0/10 for MP.
  Can also absorb items.
tentacles [auto ability, pushed through gen_wc_bonus()]
  Tentacles are an automatic ability that either attempts to attack or
  defend based on player specified settings.  Players can assign each,
  some, or all of the 10 tentacles to either defend or attack.  The
  amount in each mode affects its effectiveness (sort of like having to
  home in on a target).  The amount of armor that the player wears 
  while changed affects the number of free tentacles (mimicing armor
  does not affect the number of tentacles). [note:  later in the guild, 
  the player gains the ability to place tentacles into either burn off 
  or regen, also]
  Tentacle forms: Axe, Knife, Shield, Regen, Digest, Carry, Wear, Wield [2x]
  Tentacles constantly drain MP. Need <num of tentacles> MP to continue.
                   
web [cost sps]
  Player can shoot a weblike substance at an attacker causing them to
  stay in place and lowering ac.
mimic [costs sps and MPs]
  Player can touch armor/weapon and mimic it, giving the player 0 
  ac/wc and the special from the armor/wep, at 1/2 of its return value.
  Mimicing an armor/wep will destroy it.
swing <dir / speed> / memorize <locs>
  Webswing around the mud.  Can swing to level / 10 memorized
  locations.
wallcrawl
  Retreat from combat.
create [costs sps and MPs]
  Player creates a ball of dark matter that can be 'form'ed several 
  into MP storage for themselves or other symbiote.
KO [costs sps]

  Player receives no exp when KO'ing a mob.  Mob will eventually wake
  up.

ambush [costs sps]
  A strong initial attack.  Can only be used once on a given mob, and
