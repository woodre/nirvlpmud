                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               


----[ The Order ]--- [new dark mage guild] ---(General Overview)-----

REQS - players must be level 6.

ADVANTAGES -    1. players are healed by the presence of other 
                   players in a room with wimpy set (this is thematic 
                   to the books where the Hunter feed off of others'
                   fears).  For each person in the room with wimpy
                   set, the player receives 1 hp/sp 3 seconds (up to 
                   a maximum of 3 hp/sp per second). ALSO NOTE THAT
                   MEMBERS OF THE ORDER MAY _NOT_ SET THEIR WIMPY!
                2. players gain xp from sacrifice at the rate of
                   sac points/1+random(3) on all things save the 
                   sacrifice of players level.
                3. increased spell casting powers.

DISADVANTAGES - 1. players is hurt by light - based on total light.
                   value of the room - i.e. light 3 = 3 hps/3 sps of
                   damage every 3 hbs or so.
                2. player gives up 1/5 of xp from each kill
                3. player cannot 'quit out' while in combat.
                4. player cannot use alcohol based heals.
                5. player may not have mini-guilds.
                6. player may not use standard mud-pets.
                7. player takes constant dmg if wimpy is set.

FAE - an independant stat that ranges from 0 to 10.  Each additional
      point of fae will cost the guild member 5,000 xp. Each fae point
      adds an additional 8 spell points as well as being used to determine
      how much fae the dmage can draw upon before things go bad. See Fae
      text document.

TASKS - there will be 8 tasks that are used to confer new levels on
        the player.  Once a certain fae and game level have been 
        reached - the player will sense a message in the fae (the 
        message will appear when the criteria is first reached, then
        every random 45 minutes, and at each login - until the task
        has been completed).

      - There are also several spell tasks that must be completed in
        order to use powers of a new found level.  Players will know
        which spells are task dependant - it will be up to then to
        read the books and discover what to do. These tasks has a high
        chance of failure resulting in the players death. Death will be
        a common thing to a dmage.
