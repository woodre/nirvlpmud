The Ruins Path: /players/maledicta/ruins
The Ruins were made to be a midlevel area, with a few exceptions to entice
high level players.  It has 23 rooms, multiple secrets, and interesting
items. The average midlevel player should be able to come here, get some
decent experience and also gain coins at a moderate rate.

        +$+  secret entrance/exit
        :H:  Hidden Way
        
        
  R1 : The entrance to the area. From here a player can either use 'path' to
       enter or 'circle ruins'.  Circle command is found by talking to
       Eghyron the hunter(found in R4). It is an easier way in after the
       initial encounter. A reward for listening and reading. 
  R2 : A guardian has been placed here. He is level 20 with 650 hps, wc 32,
       and ac 10. He has a 10% chance of doing 20 damage each round. He has
       an anhk of light on him. This item will heal the player who wears it
       for 50 hps. It has a one time use and is also ac 1 with light.
  R3 : This room has one special exit to it, 'climb pillar', which will
       clone a mob called 'darkling' to the room the first time it is
       done. Darkling is level 13 with 250 hps, wc 25, ac 8, and has a
       special that does 20 damage on a 10% chance. Darkling will block
       all exits except for west.
  R4 : This is the room for the hunter. Here he will tell you of a secret
       exit, 'move shelf', then 'enter hole' and also that you can use
       the command, 'collect bounty' when holding an object from the
       archangels. the bounty collected is 1500+random(500) for the 
       normal archangels, and 4000+random(2000) for the cloak used
       by the Archangel of Shadows. Eghyron is a weak fight, and is
       made to be so, so players can screw themselves over when they
       don't consider what he does for them.
  R5 : nothing of note.
  R6 : nothing of note.
  R7 : This room is where the first archangel is encountered. This one
       is of type Ice. He is level 15 with 300 hps, wc 22, ac 14 and
       does 10+random(10) damage on a random 15% chance. His corpse
       destroys itself and leaves behind his weapon.
  R8 : This room contains an Archangel of Fire. Similar to the Iceangel
       only it has a wc of 25 and ac 10, with a higher damage special
       that does random(16)+10 with a 15% chance per round.       
  R9 : This room contains another iceangel and a shadowmane. Shadowmane
       is level 12, with wc 20, ac 7, and hp of random(50)+200. It also
       has a special that does random(15)+5 damage on a 15% chance. When
       shadowmane dies it leaves behind an amulet that if worn will do
       20 points of damage to the player. An amulet is worth 50 coins.
       Shadowmanes are also aggressive and necessary to fight if you
       want to kill the iceangel. A secret entrance can be found by using
       'push lever', it takes the player to R17.
 R10 : This room contains a fireangel and an exit down.
 R11 : This room contains a fireangel.
 R12 : nothing of note.
 R13 : This room contains a shadowmane and a secret entrance into R23,
       which is where the Archangel of death is. Enter by using,
       'turn pearl'.
 R14 : This room contains a fireangel and shadowmane.
 R15 : This room contains a fireangel.
 R16 : This room contains a fireangel.
 R17 : This room contains an iceangel.
 R18 : Nothing of note.
 R19 : This room contains an iceangel.
 R20 : Nothing of note.
 R21 : This room contains an iceangel and shadowmane.
 R22 : This room contains 3 shadowmane and the Archangel of Shadows.
       the archangel carries a whip, shield and cloak(see below). The
       Archangel of Shadows is level 20, hps 600, wc 23, and ac is 14.
       His special does 30 damage at 20% chance. He blocks the exit
       out also. The 3 shadowmanes are aggressive.
 R23 : This room is entered by using the secret in R13. The Archangel
       of death can be found here, he is level 20, with 650 hps, 28
       wc and 18 ac. He has one special that can do 20 damage with a 
       20% chance. His other special is called from heart beat and
       does 20 damage while at the same time healing itself for 20. 
       This occurs on a 20% chance. When dead he drops the gloves
       of lifestealing*(please note below). The player may leave
       the room by using the same method as in R13, 'turn pearl'.

  Special notes on weapons and objects:
  
  Fire weapons: Fireweapons are used by the archangels of fire. They are
                all similar in description and wc with the same special.
                I used this method of similarity because I saw no reason
                to make individual weps for each since it follows theme. 
                Types are as follows:
                   Type:      WC:  Weight:   
                     axe -    17     3        
                    mace -    15     1
                    maul -    17     3
                  scythe -    17     2
                   spear -    16     2
                   sword -    16     2
                **Firespecials: if random(19) > 16 then 7 damage, else
                                if random(19) > 9  then 3 damage.
  
  Ice weapons:  Similar to the weapons of fire, there are 5 types:
                    Type:       WC:  Weight:
                  cleaver -     16     1
            military fork -     17     3
                   hammer -     17     3
                 lajatang -     17     2
          footman's lance -     18     6
                  trident -     17     3
                **Icespecials: Same as Fire with one exception, Lance does
                               7 & 4 damage on specials.
                               
  Gloves of lifestealing <wc 16>:
                           This is a unique item that took alot of thought
                           when coding it.  First, it shows up in the
                           inventory as 2 separate items, even though it is
                           a single. This was done by:
                                set_short("glove of lifestealing [left]\n"+
                                          "glove of lifestealing [right]");
                           When wielded the short is changed to:
                       set_short("glove of lifestealing [left]  (wielded)\n"+
                                 "glove of lifestealing [right]");                                        
                           this gives the illusion of both wielded. The short
                           is changed back on a drop or unwield.
                           Its power is the ability to hit twice on a 25%
                           chance per round. When its special goes off it does
                           up to 26 damage to the opponent, and heals the user
                           for half the amount done. 
                             Drawbacks: When wielded it does 25 damage.
                                        If the player is not fighting and
                                        stands around too long it will
                                        randomly do 10 damage on a 15 
                                        count call_out() at an 8% chance.
                                        Also, if a shield is detected worn
                                        in the inventory, the gloves destroy
                                        it. 
                                        I have multiple checks and loops to
                                        make sure that there are no loose
                                        ends on this somewhat complicated
                                        item.
                                        It is also non-save.
                          NOTE: this weapon is somewhat powerful, but
                                with strong drawbacks, not to mention that
                                Archangel of Death is a hard fight with
                                his healing ability and overall strength.
