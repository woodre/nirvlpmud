Entrance area is outside of Hampton Coliseum
There is a ticket stub at my crystals that will take you there
if you 'wish' it
you can leave to return

There is a dealer that sells dots of different colors...right now,
only blue...blue takes you to Fee area if you place it on your tongue
dots cost 100 coins

Can only enter area every hour, it resets itself each time like the 
mystic caves - that way it can always tell a story.
