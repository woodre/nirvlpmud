Subj: Ideas/Suggestions

Cc: (To: fred) forbin

. Here are the suggestions I think might improve the guild.  By          
. no means do I think they are underpowered as some people have 
. suggested, but there are little tweaks that might make the 
. overall experience more enjoyable. 
.  [1] Honor:  
.       -Increase both the rate honor is gained and the rate at  
.        which it is lowered so that if a player takes some time 
.        off, they are not hindered too much by having low honor. 
.       -Make a higher level duration ability, bloodtrance that  
.        lowers the cost of bloodhonor requirements (make it  
.        drain sps on continuous basis like dodge). 
.        You could create another mob to defeat in order to be  
.        taught this power. 
.  [2] Weapon slots:  
.       -I think we need perhaps two more weapon slots, giving  
.        the player a total of six to choose from. 
.       -I still like the idea of having forged weapon costs 
.        increased to around 150k or 200k (something that has 
.        to be actually worked for - especially now that coins 
.        are a little harder to come by) and having to store  
.        them in a weapon rack that we'd have to purchase for 
.        our guild room.  (This would clear up any questions 
.        about weapons being so EASY to get once you max them) 
.  [3] Guild attributes:  
.       -At the higher levels, attribute gain comes much too  
.        slow, perhaps lower this a little bit. 
.  [4] More BF equipment:  
.       -Not neccessarily BF only eq, but put in some more  
.        arena mobs that can be challenged and have them 
.        drop new equip or reward the winner of the battle  
.        with new equip that gives bonuses to gobj. 
.  [5] Socket/Unsocket:  
.       -Have gem rarity, guild level, dex, luck all play a 
.        role in successful unsocketing.  Right now, 1 in 2 
.        chance is terrible. 
.       -Also, increase gem costs to 120k or so to make up  
.        for easier unsocketing. 
.  [6] Attack spell: 
.       -I'd like to see this attack have increased damage 
.        (maybe 100-130 based on stance) and be usable only 
.        once on a mob.  Have it clone an object that will 
.        not allow you to use it again if you have already 
.        used it. 
.       -Also, if you do that, make player need to be fully 
.        rested (maxed endurance) and have no current 
.        duration abilites working in order to use it. 
.

Subj: unstorable items & museum

Is there any specific reason some of your items do not store, other than 
past storage rules.  I'd like to make your nightpike and legendary 
platemail storable now that the rules have changed, but I wouldn't want to 
step on your toes if you have them unstorable for a reason. 
 
Secondly, is there any chance we can re-open your Museum.  I know it could 
be a slaughter house at times, but it was something the players were fond 
of, and currently our playerbase stinks.  Perhaps letting them have a 
little fun would help.  I, for one, would like to see the Museum again.  
 
Let me know what you think about these two issues.  Thanks.

I have no clue what policies are like now or how the game has changed.  I 
am in no position to write code or even change my own code without first 
puutting in a lot of time which I don't intend to put in to nirvana.  if 
you feel so strongly about this, go ahead and make a copy of the museum 
code, make whatever changes you feel are necessary, and reopen it.  just 
redirect the transpot room to the new file directory.  i dont even remember 
what i wrote when i made that stuff so I certainly can't say why it is the 
way it is.  i'd never wanted it to be an area where players could easily 
kill everything but i guess it doesn't matter anymore.  do what you want.
