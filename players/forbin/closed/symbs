Symbiotes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview

The symbiote guild is one based on a symbiotic relationship between the
player (the host) and the symbiote mob.  Guild is joined by the player 
touching a ball of dark matter - as they do, the symbiote enters their
body and forms a bond.  Players will give their symbiote A name.  The
player will have no special powers until they 'changeform', letting the
symbiote cover them with darkmatter.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Drawbacks

 1. Most abilities require the use of MP or matter points to use them.
    MP are gained from draining corpses or items and this amount is
    saved on the gobj over boot, etc. [essentially an added cost]
 2. Abilities require 'changeform'.  When unchanged, player receives no 
    special powers and cannot use the general mud spells.
 3. No mud pets or kids.  The symbiote is a jealous organism and will 
    fight at ALL costs for your total attention.
 4. No mini guilds.
 5. Major weakness to "other|fire".  [one and one half damage]
 6. Severe weakness to "other|sonic". [double damage]          
 7. Reduced SPs.
 8. Reduced spell point healing rate.
 9. Infusion harms the symbiote.
10. Take greater damage than normal players.
11. Extreme damage can cause player to revert to normal [quite painful
    to the symbiote and therefore the player as well]   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages

1. Increased WC.
2. Increased physical resistance. [10% res]
3. Major resistance to "other|mental". [75% resistance]
4. Increased HPs.
5. Increased hit point healing rate.

Abilities (given in general order acquired)

changeform [costs sps and MPs]
  Allows symbiote to cover player with dark matter.  Most of the guild
  abilities do not work when player is not changed.  The exception is
  'absorb'.
say [auto ability]
  When changed, says and tells are changed to support the host/symbiote
  relationship, i.e. I = We, Me = Us, etc.  [mainly thematic]
absorb <corpse> [no cost]    
  Allows player to drain corpse for Matter Points.  Based off of corpse
  level, however they receive slight bonus if they absorb corpse while 
  changed.
tentacles [auto ability, pushed through gen_wc_bonus()]
  Tentacles are an automatic ability that either attempts to attack or
  defend based on player specified settings.  Players can assign each,
  some, or all of the 10 tentacles to either defend or attack.  The
  amount in each mode affects its effectiveness (sort of like having to
  home in on a target).  The amount of armor that the player wears 
  while changed affects the number of free tentacles (mimicing armor
  does not affect the number of tentacles). [note:  later in the guild, 
  the player gains the ability to place tentacles into either burn off 
  or regen, also]
web slam [cost sps]
  Player can shoot a weblike substance at an attacker causing damage.
mimic [costs sps and MPs]
  Player can touch armor and mimic it, giving the player the half the 
  ac but not the special from the armor.  Mimicing an armor will 
  destroy it.
darts [cost sps and MPs]
  This is a fairly strong attack that can only be used while in combat
  and while not being directly hit.
burn off [cost hps, sps and MPs to start, hps to maintain]
  Player can put tentacles toward burning off toxins (soak/stuff/intox)
  in their body.  The more tentacles put toward burn off, the quicker
  and more effective it is.
absorb <item> [no cost]
  Allows player to drain item for Matter Points.  They receive slight 
  bonus if they absorb item while changed.
suffocate [costs sps and MPs]
  Player tries to suffocate an attacker with dark matter.  Can only be
  initiated when attacker is at 3/10 health or less, chance of failure.
  Causes damage over time.
fatal [costs sps]
  General fatal ability.  Can only be initiated when attacker is at
  0/10 health.
regen [costs sps and MPs to start, sps to maintain]
  Player can put tentacles toward regenerating hit points at an 
  increased pace.  The more tentacles put toward regen, the quicker and
  more effective it is.
wep [costs sps]
  Causes the player to shape a weapon from dark matter and lash out at
  opponent with a one time attack.  This ability can be used at the
  same time as webslam or darts, however the player must have a free
  hand to use it.  (weapon and no shield, or shield and no weapon)
create [costs sps and MPs]
  Player creates a ball of dark matter that can be 'form'ed several 
  into different items: an armor, a weapon, an attack spell, a web 
  spell, a heal spell, or MP storage for themselves or other symbiote.
KO [costs sps]
  Allows player to knock a mob unconcious.  Player can then drag this
  unconcious mob around and either: devour, feed, or later dominate it.
  Player receives no exp when KO'ing a mob.  Mob will eventually wake
  up.
devour
  Allows player to essentially 'eat' an unconcious mob for a heal based
  on the mobs stats [note: heal is better than normal corpse healing]   
feed
  Allows player to slowy (over time) 'eat' an unconcious mob for a heal
  based on the mobs stats [note: heal is better than 'devour' healing]  
camouflage [costs sps and MPs]
  Total invisibility, unseen by any player except wizards.  Moving 
  forces visibility, so only useful as an ambush tactic.
alarm [costs sps and MPs]
  Leave a piece of dark matter behind to alert you to someone else 
  entering the room.
ambush [costs sps]
  A strong initial attack.  Can only be used once on a given mob, and
  player must be camouflaged to use it.
wound [costs sps and MPs]
  An attack that can wound a mob with dark matter.  Use is delayed to
  simulate player looking for the right opportunity.  Does damage over 
  time after successful wounding.
dominate [costs sps and MPs]
  Player subjugates an unconcious mob as a weak pet.
frenzy [costs sps and MPs]
  For the duration of combat, gain possiblity of up to two extra 
  attacks per round.  Can only be initiated from combat. [note: similar
  to bloodfist bloodfury]
