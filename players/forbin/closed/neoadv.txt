Neo Advancement

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I know you wanted to increase the cost of advancement in the neos, and
here is the idea I originally had when I was going to rewrite them.

The original neo guild had three skills: creation, control, and combat, 
and each skill could range from 0 to 6.  I propose making the guild have
these three skills range from 0-8.  This would give us a little more
freedom to add some nice features to the guild.

Players could convert normal mud experience to guild experience at a
1:1 ratio.  They could then use this guild experience to raise a given
skill by a pt.  The cost for each point (1 through 8) would increase
incrementally.  

In order for the player to increase a given skill, they'd have to use
powers tied to this skill.  This would be very similar to the old
warrior guild - in order to advance, you'd first have to work up to
a proficency with the powers associated with the skill you want to
raise.

Players would be limited to 21 total points, so they would have to 
choose which three slots they leave free.  The player could max the 
guild in a balanced fashion: 7/7/7, they could skew towards two skills 
at the cost of the other: 8/8/5, or could be somewhere in between: 8/7/6.
Because each increased point costs more than the last, players would max 
the guild at different experience costs, based on their choices.  Below 
is an outline of costs as I see them:

1st skill point in given skill:    300,000
2nd skill point in given skill:    400,000
3rd skill point in given skill:    500,000
4th skill point in given skill:    600,000
5th skill point in given skill:    700,000
6th skill point in given skill:    800,000
7th skill point in given skill:    900,000
8th skill point in given skill:  1,000,000

If player maxes guild at 7/7/7, total cost is 8,700,000 exp.
If player maxes guild at 8/7/6, total cost is 8,900,000 exp.
If player maxes guild at 8/8/5, total cost is 9,250,000 exp.

On the other hand, we could just let them get all 24 skill pts and 
ear the entire list of guild powers.
