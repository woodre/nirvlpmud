Here is some more ideas and fleshing out I had for the trial.

** REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TRIAL **

- must be a 19+5 level Dervish.
- must have piety of 30.
- must read a scroll or tablet or what have you to receive instructions
  for the trail and hints.
- must collect the 10 required items or power.
- must seek and find the entrance to the Caves of Nar-Tuith.
- must battle and defeat the sandstorm that blocks the entrance to the
  cave.
- must sacrifice the items on an altar within the caves to open the
  doorway to the caverns.
- must seek inside the caverns to find the scrolls of Nar-Tuith and 
  learn how to 'invoke' their power.
- player then sacrifices himself at the altar.


** BENEFITS **
Players will see the following benefits:
  - race becomes HIR+"Sandstorm"+NORM (which enables to dual-wield at 
    any level).
  - +3 str benefit, allowing player to have a maximum of 21 str after 
    completing test (this still keeps dervish considerably lower than
    the majority of the mud).
Players will not see this benefit:
  - !random(4) chance that sand pt won't go down in check_sand().

** ITEMS OF POWER **

I'd suggest a list of 30-40 acceptable items, but make two lists, one
of non-store items and one of storable items, and have it randomly 
call which items are need for a given player.
This would perhaps cut down on people telling someone else all the 
items to get.  Perhaps have it require 6 storable items of power and 
4 non-store.  This will make the task slightly difficult, as the 
player will have to get the remaining 4 items, prepare for the test by
coining and eq'ing, then search the desert for the sandstorm, defeat
the sandstorm, sacrifice all the 10 items, then enter and search the
caverns, after which they find the scrolls of Nar-Tuith, they must
figure out how to use or 'invoke' them.

On the balance front, this task would give the player marginal benefit, 
while forwarding the Dervish theme.
