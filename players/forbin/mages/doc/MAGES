Guild Advancement ----------------------------------------------------

The guild is broken down into 7 guild levels, with the player starting
at guild level 1.  So players will be required to advance through 6
levels of increasing experience costs.  But unlike most other guilds, 
the guild levels do not determine most abilities.  All mage abilites 
except for basic guild functions are based on the level of four guild 
attributes: Power, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Will Power, and the eight 
schools of magic: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, 
Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation.  

  Advancement in the Mages Guild follows a four path method.  
  
[2] Guild Attributes:
As the player fights, attribute experience is gained at the rate of
10%.  Once the player has enough experience to advance their 
attributes, they gain 'free' attribute points that can be 'spent' at
certain guild NPCs to raise guild attributes.  Players gain a total of
350 attribute points.  This makes it impossible to max all four stats,
and requires players to pick and choose.

[3] Magic Schools:
Again, as the player fights, school experience is gained, however,
school experience is gained at the rate of 15%.  Once the player has
enough expereience to advance their schools, they gain 'free' school
points that can be 'spent' at certain guild NPCs to raise given school
levels.  Players gain a total of 675 school points.  This again makes
it impossible to max all schools, and requires players to pick and 
choose.

[4] Spell Train Points:
Spell train points are gained directly from casting spells.  Players 
receive a point value each time a spell is cast.  The value is dependant 
on whether the spell cast is failed, miscast, or succeeds, and sometimes 
there is a damage or effect modifier - all of which is again modified 
by the target mob's level.  Once a player reaches enough points for a
new spell train point, it is automatically rewarded.  The player may 
then visit a guild NPC to attempt learning a new spell.  This is done to 
simulate practicing the spells gained.  The number of spell trains are
unlimited over a mage's lifetime, as learning a new spell can be 
difficult, especially with low attributes.  A limited number of 'spell 
slots' limit the number of spells a player can learn.

[5] Learning New Spells:
Learning spells takes two things:  free exp and training points.  Each 
spell level requires the same number of free training points; i.e. to
learn Magic Missile, a level 1 spell, would take 1 training point, while
learning Sunburst, a level 5 spell, would take 5 training points.  The
higher a spell is in level,  the more free experience is needed.  The
player will then find one of the guild NPCs that train spells, and
will be able to learn a spell.  Players are only shown a list of 
spells that they can learn based on their attribute/school levels.
When starting the guild, a player is given 4 free level 1 spells of 
their choice, with no training pt or free exp required.

Advantages -----------------------------------------------------------

[1] Increased Spell Damage:
Instead of a max damage equal to an average of 28 (as max legal sonic 
does), mages can have a max damage equal to average 60.

[2] Improved Spell Damage Costs:
Mages are able to cast spells at 2/3 the rate of the normal spell 
damage cost chart.

[3] Increased Magical Ability:
Mages may have a maximum mag stat of 100.  This will give mages a
total possible increase of 140 sps at maxed stat.  (This increase in
magic is controlled by the guild attribute of Magic.

[4] Increased SP regeneration:
Mages heal sps at the rate of 1 + POWER/25 each autoheal.  POWER is 
a guild stat that ranges from 1-100, so the max a mage can heal sps 
each autoheal is 5 sps.

[5] Shortened Spell Delays
Mages can shorten the time needed to cast a spell by "preparing" it 
in advance.  This basically fills a preperation slot with a spell 
for instant casting.  Mages have a limited number of these slots 
based on guild attributes and the act of preparing a spell takes 3 
times as long as casting - the benefit being instant casting while
the player is in combat.  Spell failure can still occur at casting.

Disadvantages --------------------------------------------------------

[1]  Low AC:
Mages are prevented from using all 'armor', 'helmet', and 'shield' 
armors and all extra worn items that may have AC.  While there are 
certainly many good AC 2 'boots', 'rings', 'amulet', and 'misc' 
pieces on the mud, players will have to work harder just to achieve 
an AC of 8.  They are stuck with this max of 8 until they learn the 
stoneskin spell (which gives an AC of 10, while preventing the 
wearing of any additional armors) or enchant armor (which for a high
cost, can embue an object with +1 AC (this will allow for Mages a 
MAX AC of 12 (4 AC 2 piece with +1 AC enchantment each).  Keep in 
mind is is much less than the maximum an unguilded player can achieve
(5 AC 'armor', 6 2 AC pieces, and a 3 AC red lace teddy equals 20 AC).  

[2]  No Weapons/Extremely Low WC:
No spells can be cast while a mage wields a weapon, however, should a
mage wish to fight without magic, they are restricted with a WC cap 
of 5 (unless the weapon is enchanted, which gives +1, making the cap
6 WC).  The actual effective WC is also lowered by weight, with 
heavier weapons having lower WC.  This will allow Mages to choose 
their weapons and still have returns and extra effects, but still 
have a much lessened effect in battle.  Let's face it - Mages are 
magic wielders, not warriors.

[3]  Chance of Spell Failure/Spell Miscast:
Even when maxed, Mages will ALWAYS have a chance of spell failure and
spell miscasting.  Spell failure is when the spell refuses to work
(i.e. nothing happens), while spell miscast is deterimental effects
when the spell is cast incorrectly.  These error will be school level, 
guild attribute level, and practice based.  EVERY SPELL (except for 
general guild abilites HAS A FAILURE RATE!

[4]  Spell delays:
Many spells have a casting time, which requires several rounds for the
spell to take effect.  Players cannot cast any other spells while they
are currently casting unless first using the 'stop casting' command,
which takes 1/3 the sps of the previous spell.  Severe damage taken
during this casting time, as many other actions could disrupt the 
spell, causing spell failure.

[5]  Lower Stamina:  
Mages have a maximum sta stat of 15 points.
       
[6]  Lower Strength:
Mages have a maximum str stat of 15 points.

[7]  Clarity:
       Clarity is a GUILD level and POWER level dependant
       pool of 'energy' that a player uses to cast spells.
       ALL SPELLS (except for general guild abilities) 
       drain this pool at different rates.  When the pool 
       is drained, the Mage must restock it before casting
       any more spells.  Clarity can only be increased by 
       one of two methods: 
         [1]  It recharges it at a standard rate outside of
              combat - ONLY while in the Mage's Tower.
         [2]  A GUILD level 50 ability, Trance, may be used
              to recharge it OUTSIDE OF COMBAT, if not 
              within the tower.
