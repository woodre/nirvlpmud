The strength potion is a powerful elixir that will create a unity between
you and your weapon, giving you a temporary weapon class of 30.  The effects
last for about 45 seconds.  When the potion wears off, the player will be
so weak, he will stop wielding the weapon.
To use, type "drink potion".
This item will destruct after one use.
