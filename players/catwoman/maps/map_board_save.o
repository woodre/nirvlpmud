If your locker isnt used that often then	the least used or idle lockers will be sold to new tenents.	remember I am limited to 100k of storage space for lockers.** ps rember I still take requests**-Catwoman**DON'T Forget about the jewelry shop(catwoman):**jewelry shop is located on the boardwalk right next to the boat dock to the islandsso now you can carry more than 60k in coinswhen you sell the rubies you take a 16% loss not bad for autoloadingrubies they are there when you logon just like the quicktyper**"
