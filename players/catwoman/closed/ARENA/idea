the Idea of this room is to allow guild wars with no casualties
each guild would choose thier champion and the guild member would enter the 
arena with no weapons or armor.  the arena will supply equal weapons and armor.
there will be a room where players may cheer thier guild member.
no exp or money will be lost or gained but a trophie will be awarded
to the guild thier must be at least 3 guild members on for that guild to participate
a chalange will be anounced then you respond by players responding whom the would like to represent thier guild
the player of choise either accepts or rejects the vote
