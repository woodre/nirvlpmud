long_desc "The House of Ill ReputeYou enter the room through large double doors only to find when you turnaround they have dissappeared into the wall of bookshelves behind you.In fact, as you look about the room, you discover that bookshelves coverevery single wall, floor to 12 foot ceiling, and are filled with rowafter row of bound leather volumes of many types.There are two exceptions:  a large stone fireplace takes up the middle ofthe far wall, and to your right is a curtained alcove.Your feet sink into the thick, blood-red carpet.  Matching overstuffedchairs and couches surround the fireplace in a semi-circle.  The room islit only by the fireplace and the many candles placed about the room."
items ({"shelves","The shelves are made of mahogany, like the furniture.  They are filled tobursting with beautiful and interesting books.","books","The sheer amount of books astounds the eye and the mind.   How could onepossibly read them all?","fireplace","The fireplace is made of beautiful gray stone.  Perhaps you could'light' it.","alcove","Behind the thick red curtains is a small alcove that contains a gorgeousmahogany four poster bed that is clothed with red satin sheets and a redstuffed velvet comforter.  Behind the bed is a gorgeous picture windowthat lends an eerie glow to the alcove.","bed","The bed looks horribly comfortable and inviting.  Perhaps you could 'lie'in it.","window","The large window takes up the entire back wall of the alcove and depictsthe lovers, Tristan and Iseult, in a passionate embrace.",})
