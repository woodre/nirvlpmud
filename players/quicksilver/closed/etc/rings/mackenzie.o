short_descr "A platinum celtic wedding band"
long_descr "   This platinum wedding band, with its muted celtic knotwork etchings, bindstogether three unique stones.   Held within a heart-shaped bezel, the center stone is--quite naturally--adiamond.  The diamond, modest yet brilliant, is deep cut.  As light fallsupon it, the fire for which the stone is famous dances within.   The brilliance of the diamond also falls radiantly upon two black opals,seated on either side.  Both contain strong hints of blue-green hue.  But asthe refracted light cast from the diamond dances across the surface of theopals, deep reds with fiery orange accents emerge.   The complex nature of this ring is bound together in a unique fashion, rifewith intricate meaning.  The clear, yet radiant, diamond would appear torepresent the purity and clarity of a marriage bond, while the opals signifythe ever-changing complexity of the relationship."
