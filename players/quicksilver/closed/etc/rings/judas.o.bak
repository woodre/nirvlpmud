inscription "@{--,--The Lover Tells Of The Rose In His Heart---`---All things uncomely and broken, all things worn out and old,The cry of a child by the roadway, the creak of a lumbering cart,The heavy steps of the ploughman, splashing the wintry mould,Are wronging your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart.The wrong of unshapely things is a wrong too great to be told;I hunger to build them anew and sit on a green knoll apart,With the earth and the sky and the water, re-made, like a casket of goldFor my dreams of your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart.                                -- William Butler Yeats"
