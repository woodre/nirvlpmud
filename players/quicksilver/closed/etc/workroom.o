The cavernis eerily dark--the only illumination comes from two red candles burningcalmly on either side of a large black velvet sofa.   You turn to look at the wall opposite the sofa and are overwhelmed by atowering bookshelf.  Gazing at the spines of the tomes, you realize that noneof them bare a title of any sort.   You shiver slightly as you attempt to allay your fears."
