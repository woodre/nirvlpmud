~*~Mizan~*~: I just uploaded the first draft and boltar hasnt yet seen it
[idle 6] You tell Tira, "he gave him permission to use his character?"

You atell Arrina : scuse me mam.
->> ~*~Mizan~*~: Not even the dumbest of the dumb, like the guy I knew who tried to put an 8" floppy into a 5 1/4" drive needed written handholding
~*~Mizan~*~: Or the guy i knew who kept sticking CDs into the crack between the CDROM and the floppy disk thinking it was the real CDROM drive, etc
atell tira is the brother of blackshadow the one with sharing...shes here telling me that there was a plan between the two people involved...and they both knew about it ...and would continue if something wasnt done.  she is here and says she will tell the complete story if needed.
~*~Mizan~*~: I have told you, there is a process, and now you must wait since you keep arguing with me.
Tira tells you: I told him it was wrong and unfair when he did it. His first
mistake was telling me about it.  It was a deal made between
him and Monkey, Monkey needed something and in return, he
was to work Blackshadow up a few levels.

You atell Arrina : tira is the brother of blackshadow the one with sharing...shes here telling me that there was a plan between the two people involved...and they both knew about it ...and would continue if something wasnt done.  she is here and says she will tell the complete story if needed.
