This area has the 'Elite' players in mind -
A +100 character could purchase a likeness of himself to immortalize him/herself as a monster.  
The player could help design what the monster would drop and help describe the monster.
A player gaining over 1000 kill points could also immortalize him/herself this way.
Kill points will be gauged on Mortal Kombat Scar or a guild pk list, points will be based on levels killed.
