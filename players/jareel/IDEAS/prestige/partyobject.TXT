A Party Object that works for prestiged players to promote parties.

Why a Prestige Party?
Bonus Prestige powers
  In a prestige party you "Pool" the prestige powers everyone has chosen, and
  add the bonus to the group. Examples:
  Cooper Has 8 Points   Dreadbane has 5 Points   Chant has 1 Point
    +3 Bonus Exp          +2 Bonus Exp             +1 Bonus EXP
	+2 WC                 +1 Detox
	+1 AC                 +1 Sp Regen
	+1 HP Regen           +1 Hp Bonus
	+1 HP Bonus
So the total bonus pool would be
   +6 Bonus EXP, +2 WC, +1 AC, +1 HP Regen, +1 Sp Regen, +2 HP Bonus
   The Party object would add all totals up in the party and/2 to give the
   party an extra bonus for having a party.

   
Party Shares - Power leveling is just a joke as it is shares should be simple and non-adjustable
Party shares - Base Level + Prestige Level/Party Members 
  Cooper level 19+43 {8} 
    would have 27 shares in the party but would contribute the most powers to
	the party so the five and take would be worth the exp suck. Also the drain 
	exp is not so crazy as once you hit level 19 as it is now where level a 19
	has little want to party with a +100.
  Chant Level 19+5 {1}
    Would have 20 shares in the party he would contribute less extra power wise 
	to the party.
  Dreadbane Level 19+87 {4}
    Would have 23 shares in the party and so on and so fourth.
  Mode Level 19+20
    Would have 19 Shares in the Party but could still party


Some interesting Ideas on Prestige party objects.
  Party Add
  Add Chant -> Dreadbane would like to add you to the party do you wish to join Dreadbanes party <YorN>?
  
  Make it a quest item or a Raid Item, once you have one you have one but you have to earn it.
