                    -- The Crimson Bat --

        This is a Specialty guild built by the Red Goddess to 
        care for and feed the Bat.  In binding the demon, she
        gained some control over the beasts hunger, finding a 
        low maintenance level so that the bat could stay on the
        mundane plane without the sacrifice of thousands of
        people each week.
