                    -- The Chaos Rune --

        Descriptive of those who are descended from the
        enthophy of that Form.  They are usually bound
        to some Form, since even Chaos must obey the Laws
        of Time, but it might be combined with any other
        Rune.  Nothing is totally safe from the taint of
        Chaos.
