                    -- The Beast Rune --

     This Rune is also called the Dragon's Eye, and is
     supposed to represent the armor plate over the dragons
     eye.  Dragons are thought to be the progenitors of
     all beasts(at least those with four or more legs) 
     though no one has had the nerve to ask the Dragon's
     about it. It is thought to have origionally been a 
     Dragonnewt Rune, and its complexity would indicate 
     this.
