The Guild of "Yelmalio(The Sun Dome Temple)"

  History
    Legend states that Yelmalio is the son of Yelm, the sun.  During the fighting
  between mortals who supported their gods.  He led his people from the warm 
  lowlands, carrting high magic and the power of his father.
    Yelmalio was a commander and a leader. He met and fought many beings for the
  cause of his father in the Gods War. But at the hill of gold he was disarmed 
  by Orlanth, and then he was abushed by Zorak Zoron, who stole his fire-powers. 
  The son of the sun fell and bled out his life-giving heat. His favored weapons
  of bow and sword fell also, and were absorbed into the knowlege of the whole
  world.
    During the darkness Yelmalio's wounds did not deter his truggle.  He joined
  with the lord elf and others to fight against the relentless of chaos.  He
  survived, and greeted the rise of his father, the Sun at the start of time.
    Since that time Yelmalio has lived in the mountains and hills, and even the
  staunchest Orlanth worshiper admits the presence of the sun.

  Runic Associations
   The Fire/Sky rune - Symbolized as a circle with a dot in the middle, this rune
                       represents the tie of the sun to the sky.
   The Truth rune    - Symbolized as a Y, this rune represents the struggle Yelmalio
                       endurerd agaist the flood of Chaos during the god war.

   Theme
       This is a god built around the worship of light, and its eternal struggle 
     against the darkness.  The Guild has continued its existence amid the hostile
     Storm worshipersbecause of the sacred pacts signed in Mythical times wherein 
     Orlanth and Yelm grudgingly admitted each others right to live.  
       Yelmalio's worshippers are a famous source of mercenaries, and many people
     obtain military training at theit temple.  Those so trained are skilled in 
     bow, but specialty noted for their use of the massed long pike in battle.

   Drawbacks
     -  Damage taken when in the the dark.

     -  Yelmalio's Geases Unique drawbacks ranging from never use an Axe - never wear 
        armor.

     -  Players may never party with a member of the storm.  A player using the weapon 'Air"
        qualifies as this.

                      'Final' Death is defined as being drawn into the Abyss and being Banished

                      Hero Quest can bestow great powers for the player but requires thinking
                      and requires a prowess in combat.
