** Yelmalian Culture
--Recognizing no central authority except the sun itself, the Yelmalians
are broken into many scattered communities of temple towns.  In the past,
some individuals have temporarily unified many of these temples under
their personal leadership, especially if they held the legendary Orb of
Sovereignty, but this is an exception rather than a rule.  As is typical 
with Elemental-worshiping organizations they are friendly with similar 
worshiping groups.

--Each Temple has a Single High Priest.  The priest has three administrative
assistants who report to him.  A Chief Priest(Priest), a Light Captain(Rune
Lord) and a Light Keeper(Priest).  Promotion is possible only when the High 
Priest dies or otherwise retires or heroquests.  The senior most Chief Priest
moves into the position.

**Weapons of Choice
--Weapons are all enchanted with the guild spell lantern, which emits a vast
amount of light.  Items not enchanted with this spell will work at 1/2 efficiency
to its wielder.  The weapons taught and used mostly by members are as follows.
-Pike
-Two-Handed Spear
-One-Handed Spear
-Shield
-Two-Handed Spear W/Shield
-Bow
-Javelin

**-Instructions for Sword will not be given for any price.  The guild does not
prohibit sword use but does not encourage training in the weapon that slew its
gods father.

**-Club and Mace are prohibited due to the long-standing antipathy toward the Dark.
