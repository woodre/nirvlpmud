Wed Apr  2 22:05:20 1997 These are files that explain my changes in each realm...
Wed Apr  2 22:06:07 1997 -----------------------------------------
Wed Apr  2 22:06:24 1997 /players/scathe/CHANGES_SNOW
Wed Apr  2 22:06:34 1997 /players/trix/CHANGES_SNOW
Wed Apr  2 22:06:45 1997 /players/dragnar/CHANGES_SNOW
Wed Apr  2 22:07:07 1997 /players/hawkeye/CHANGES_SNOW
Wed Apr  2 22:07:20 1997 /players/bastion/CHANGES_SNOW
Wed Apr  2 22:07:29 1997 /players/hippo/CHANGES_SNOW
Thu Jun 19 21:29:24 1997 Changed mechs to new format - very low hp, high cost, high heal rate, high damage (return is_pet() so 20k laserball can be killed in side_attack), low ac. Rollingmech is high hp, low damage, lower healing.
Fri Jun 20 02:29:01 1997 Added a shogun bonus of 2 to weapon damage and -3sps to strike attacks
Mon Jun 23 16:03:43 1997 put Snowfire back into the master ring lineup /players/saber/closed/master as he is still in the shop lineup. I assume he was taken out before due to unauthorized use of Snowfire name while deleted
Wed Jun 25 16:06:10 1997 added a couple rooms to my ~/ROOMS/death area.. now there is a passageway to get to the ogre mage - players must defeat a demon in each room to continue toward the mage. Also, I made the lair room NT and players unable to leave unless they kill the 2 demons and the ogre mage... at least they have plenty of warning...
Tue Jul  8 03:46:27 1997 changed the ninja weps so that special attack chance would occur on random(14) instead of random(20). this means a chance of 60/140 chance for a special at max guild level.
Tue Jul  8 04:40:46 1997 changed guild strike attacks to conform to spell_object regs where formerly cost was set to hit_player direct damage regs.
Wed Jul 16 17:38:42 1997 lowered required CyberNinja guild xp for belt levels. Now requires 480,000 to get to black belt and 1,480,000 to get to max 10th degree black belt. Of course, this is in addition to the 800,000 needed for guild levels (plus coins). Still a hefty sacrifice but a little more reasonable considering the current state of affairs.
Fri Sep 12 16:13:02 1997 Installed attack modes in CyberNinja Guild. Defense lowers damage and raises ac. Attack raises damage and lowers to 0 ac.
Tue Sep 16 18:07:04 1997 Reimbursed Terral 15k coins for about 40k of items lost due to reimprisonment (my fault)
Wed Sep 24 03:22:00 1997 reinstated Fury at ex-lev 18 and full guild stats
Thu Oct  2 04:46:44 1997 Have placed a follow function in my ~/ITEMS/feeler and dfeeler that allows players to follow other players inside my realms. It will not work in the cyberninja guild rooms for deathtrap reasons and cuts off if the followed exits my realms.
Mon Oct  6 00:45:44 1997 Restored Terral's xp to what it was previous to his deaths vs. Shadowking (who killed him outside of the room unfairly)
Wed May 20 15:50:23 1998 Changed CN overload enhancement damage to heal_self - made overload do hit_player without checks (can kill player) plus chance of double damage to player. Plus chance of loss of stat.
Thu May 21 17:15:52 1998 added high density supergoop and proteinblast heals. potency 50, stuff or soak 6, uses 3, cost 3000
Sat Jun  6 02:17:48 1998 changing cybers over to shadow armor system
Thu Jun 18 04:41:02 1998 restored Kazer's lost 1.35 mil xp after death in Feldegast's sparring arena. bug had to do with a failed catch in a CN guild spell. bug fixed
Wed Jun 24 14:58:06 1998 changed droids to not function in any way if master is a ghost
Tue Jun 30 20:07:08 1998 Changed the lowest mech, flakemech, to not is_pet() as it falls into the non-pet range according to rules. it costs 2000 coins and has 50hps,ac4,wc10(wc15 40% for total wc of 12)
Wed Aug 12 15:41:54 1998 reduced wc of all cyber weapons by at least 2, plus raised the weight on naginata and ninjato to go along with descriptions
Wed Aug 12 18:54:13 1998 added another negative 2 to damage for having positive alignment
Wed Aug 12 18:54:50 1998 on the cyber weapons re: previous
Tue Sep 15 14:59:37 1998 Removed droids and refunded cost
Fri Sep 18 02:10:14 1998 made my Vortex/Gate have a chance to be pk
Mon Sep 21 02:41:33 1998 Changed defense shadow to give -20% defense for being Renegade honor. Changed p1-p3 spells to lower damage rate for Renegade (-2) and Defense mode (-5) while raising damage by 1 for Attack mode
Tue Sep 22 01:21:18 1998 made Renegades unable to use guild channels. also made renegades unable to hold guild positions.
Thu Sep 24 03:59:34 1998 Made a casting cost for power wield commands to lower spell spam.
Thu Sep 24 04:00:36 1998 lowered weapon strength on naginata, ton-fa, and nunchaku. these weapons had mysteriously risen in power at some point.
Sat Sep 26 17:45:52 1998 Upped damage taken by ninjas in attack mode from +10% to +15% (meaning ninjas take more damage when they are in attack mode, not that they do any more)
Sat Sep 26 17:46:53 1998 Changed conversion to subtract 1 sp when it is ended. This should reduce the frequency of ninjas turning it on and off quickly to transfer hp->sp more quickly
Sun Sep 27 20:03:02 1998 Increased damage taken by ninjas while in attack mode to +25%
Sun Sep 27 20:23:52 1998 Changed cost for ending conversion to -4 sps
Mon Oct  5 14:47:43 1998 changed cyber guild entrance to pk with full guild powers. there is a warning in init() that it is a cyber guild zone. also, there is no reason why anyone other than a cyber would go there. it is also NT so that party follows are not abused
Tue Oct  6 14:47:50 1998 Opened up the Elemental Test. The rewards are a storable ac2 amulet with special powers, a storable sword with special powers, 80k coins, or 100k xp. There is a huge risk of dying so I think these rewards are suitable.
Tue Oct  6 14:49:24 1998 Players must be at least level 19 to attempt the Test so there is a risk of significant xp loss.
Thu Oct 22 02:58:37 1998 changed cost for transto error to 40 from 200. if it does not get the player there, it should not cost 200 sps as it is the highest rank ability cybers have
Sat Nov  7 12:24:33 1998 due to the common aspect of speedsters now, I have included speeding as a guild ability and removed it as an enhancement.
Mon Nov  9 17:11:15 1998 withdrew casting cost penalty for power attacks. this was unfair restriction due to lag restraints
Sat Nov 14 13:59:40 1998 changed flakemech price from 8k to 1k as it is a standard and very weak guild pet. also changed location of blades damage from fake_beat to shadow as it is more realistic that way (called when player w/blades is hit rather than on call_out)
Mon Nov 16 13:45:57 1998 reinstated Legion to the guild levels I could find in the logs. somehow he lost everything in the guild update
Tue Nov 24 17:34:54 1998 lowered mech cost - laser from 60-40k, shuriken from 45-25k, rolling from 30-15k, whirli from 15-10k. This due to testing that shows damage slightly higher than a 10k generic pet for laserballs plus nearly 100% death rate in fights vs. lev20 mons for lasers and shurikens due to side hits
Tue Nov 24 17:37:35 1998 changed bionics damage bonus from random guild level to a simple 3
Tue Nov 24 18:45:32 1998 made new command "stun" that basically stops monsters from wimpying for a maximum of 30 secs at max guild level for a cost of 60sp. does not affect players
Thu Dec 10 01:47:37 1998 set cap on honor so top honor levels are much harder to maintain
Mon Dec 14 21:35:33 1998 changed UltraMorph heal to same stats as goops and blasts, created high density ultramorph with same stats as high density goops and blasts
Mon Dec 14 21:40:05 1998 Changed Knights in mountain area to crime_to_attack
Tue Dec 22 20:11:21 1998 Made my shadowgate area all pk
Tue Dec 22 20:15:39 1998 Made ChAoS a pk area again.
Wed Dec 23 15:53:55 1998 Changed upwho to the standard showing query_invis < player level. upwho does not show wizzes at all

Tue Jan  5 17:41:26 1999 updated work filer
Tue Jan  5 17:42:04 1999 changed starlight to add -50 hit points if used in combat in the nexus (with no heartbeat fix)

Wed Jan  6 07:05:53 1999 Reinstalled bartender in newbie bar so newbies can buy bar food and drink

Tue Jan 26 23:53:10 1999 approved Illarion's dkatana2.c for game use
Thu Jan 28 01:52:09 1999 Made ranger and dark ranger ac max of 12 until changes are made
Fri Jan 29 20:10:08 1999 Made cyber guild full pk guild - many high level abilities are not usable unless pk, p3 included. maximum damage and chance for damage by weapon was lowered for non-pk. no raises in power made
Fri Jan 29 20:34:14 1999 added sp costs to mech fighting. cost is 3 for laser, 2 for shuriken, and 1 for rolling (per hb)
Mon Feb  1 10:13:11 1999 Disabled /players/catwoman/obj/menu2.c as it allows remote selling of objects at full shop prices (values up to 1100 coins) and has no weight or other disadvantages
Mon Feb  1 10:25:13 1999 Gave /saber/monsters/dream.c a random20 chance of being wc45 and random20 chance of ac25. This is to help stop bot use in the area
Mon Feb  1 21:06:35 1999 approved ranger forms wolfpack and parry
Tue Feb  2 14:36:00 1999 Approved ranger pack (weight/6, pp create cost only while morphed, 100k xp to gain ability) and blast spell (hit_player guildlev/2, cost guildlev*2. MAX = 40 damage for 160pp)
Wed Feb  3 20:06:36 1999 Changed heroin/hunting_grounds/preds/bioarmor,biocloak,bishield,booster, and predclaws from insanely high values to 800-1000 values each. Will have to look at the area more to determine final values
Fri Feb 26 15:15:37 1999 rm'd /mizan/closed/poly/thanatos.o so that a new thanatos could join the guild

Mon Mar  1 17:00:45 1999 changed the vamp wolf corpse eat heal from an automatic heal_self(15) to heal_self(corpse heal value)
Mon Mar  1 17:18:16 1999 /mizan/closed/poly/PDM.c - changed hit_creature to check if monster is a ghost, if damage is greater than monster hps, and to lower damage so that the call_out does not kill

Thu Mar  4 18:26:50 1999 re: palsword - players can't use the weapon with low alignment but it probably should not kill them.. it's not that great a weapon
Thu Mar  4 18:50:56 1999 changed cyberninja digest to digest soaked instead of intox (makes more sense), took out healing, kept sp cost same
Thu Mar  4 18:53:32 1999 fixed self_destruct in mech
Fri Mar  5 14:09:50 1999 put extra check in mech special hit function to avoid bug log

Fri Mar 19 14:08:14 1999 changed dishonor to not be broadcast on the guild channel. This is to encourage dishonoring

Mon Mar 29 16:48:22 1999 /morgar/hall.c changed if(!mirror) to if(!present("mirror")) to belay multiple cloning
Mon Mar 29 17:04:10 1999 set borealis' level to 5 as xp was reset on dervish guild entrance but level was not.. good thing we are beta testing
Tue Mar 30 18:43:53 1999 consolidated some exits in ~/gate.c and put them in ~/nature.c
Wed Mar 31 16:56:54 1999 made a flux return message so that ninjas could see how much of the flux (vaguely) is actually hitting the opponent
Thu Apr  1 03:45:54 1999 trix/castle/town/monst/president.c - set whimpy since bank presidents might not want to fight to the death when their coins are at risk
Sat Apr  3 23:44:17 1999 altered Dervish init() to only work if is_player to avoid problems with mudkids

Sun Apr  4 06:50:38 1999 added a ::reset(arg); line to wocket's bloodlust, replaced Aelic's bloodlust with a non-buggy version
Sun Apr  4 21:08:38 1999 set maximum damage reduction for cyber in defense mode of 20 (before there was no max)
Sun Apr  4 21:13:52 1999 changed chance of loss from rejuvenate from 10% to 50% (loss of 1/2 hp->sp transfer)
Sun Apr  4 21:17:15 1999 put in automatic 20% loss on high conversion rate for cybers

Mon Apr  5 19:02:19 1999 reset kitiara's guild status as boltar saw fit to restore her
Tue Apr  6 17:19:04 1999 dervish heartbeat.h stat check - added a reset(); after the save to reset the hp changes from stat reduction. Also added a message so people know their stats are being reduced
Wed Apr  7 13:10:22 1999 reorganized dervish help files (getting too big)
Wed Apr  7 14:30:46 1999 dervish stat restrictions now do not affect wizzes
Thu Apr  8 17:58:10 1999 hurtbrain/castello/gang/rifle.c value changed from 300 to 50 due to monsters over value
Thu Apr  8 18:00:12 1999 gang/rifle.c changed back - either coins or equipment is fine for value
Thu Apr  8 18:01:57 1999 removed a bad exit from gang/gang4-3.c
Fri Apr  9 13:53:44 1999 set unsane/closed/monsters/judge.c hps from 1000 to 10000 due to this monster being an integral part of the realm and, because of that, needs to be cloned by players if dead. Killing it and cloning it again is not beneficial now
Sat Apr 10 15:47:06 1999 put in help file for Dervish guild leave command
Mon Apr 12 20:23:51 1999 emerson/weap/pencil.c added checks for this_player() and is_player()

Tue Apr 13 14:26:03 1999 Upped the level for nexus pk to minimum of 15
Tue Apr 13 19:56:09 1999 Put a check into the cyber shadow so that guild defenses function normally vs. players (i.e. if player is hitting ninja for more than the damage cap, damage is reduced to the damage cap so that defenses are doing something)
Tue Apr 13 21:43:13 1999 set the cyber heartbeat to remove spell damage from the player if the player is not in combat - i.e. if(query_spell_dam() && !query_attack()) removed spell_dam. this so cybers can use spells to attack even if they cast a spell that wasn't used (that set their spell damage)
Wed Apr 14 12:14:11 1999 removed cyber shadow damage cap - hopefully abilities that are going way over cap somehow are fixed
Fri Apr 16 01:52:19 1999 For the Elemental Test. I made the test rooms pk areas, changed granite's level to 19 so he could register as a player and still be attacked, added xp bonuses of 10,000 to each test monster (50k for finishing the test) - I don't think people will do this for the xp
Sat Apr 17 13:47:04 1999 modified poly PDM.c to allow killing with the damage function if there is a this_player()
Wed Apr 21 02:47:06 1999 /llew/closed/crystal/demon.c made it so the monster doesn't lose big attack when players leave the room. I believe the monsters were approved because of this large attack. since players can easily avoid it, it is kinda silly
Fri Apr 23 17:43:27 1999 Took away the honor bonus for recruiting as it is expected the player get honored by guildmates for recruiting
Fri Apr 23 20:35:38 1999 made cybereyes actually function correctly - as in cybers can see in dark up to -2 if they have that enhancement
Sat Apr 24 14:30:29 1999 added more titles to Dervish titles
Sat Apr 24 16:50:58 1999 snakespear/zultayne/treasure/staff.c changed return chance from ~60% to ~30% as it is storable and there is no notation why it would not conform to the storable weapon rules
Sat Apr 24 16:54:46 1999 changed snow/MONSTERS/cleop.c to be a little more powerful
Sat Apr 24 17:11:55 1999 shadows/mon/death_knight.c made slightly more powerful
