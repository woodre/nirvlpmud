Wed Apr 28 20:27:49 1999 replaced Beth's lost xp to a second death as a ghost. I will fix the poly ob since it is continuing the fight after death
Wed Apr 28 20:54:31 1999 mizan/closed/poly/PDM.c and gob.c removed monitor (as used in call_out) as guild monitors are now illegal and it serves no purpose
Wed Apr 28 20:55:07 1999 mizan/closed/poly/golem.c and tetrapod.c put in check for ghost in attacks so the fight doesn't keep going after the player dies
Fri Apr 30 12:10:28 1999 made poly golems unable to cast sonic (as they should never have been able to cast sonic)
Mon May  3 00:48:12 1999 changed saber/fur/selcoffin2.c to weight 20 from 7. Players are carrying this around and resetting it at various places. more should be done but I don't have the time right now
Tue May  4 15:53:16 1999 approved Zeus changing demon system to destruct, approved Zeus taking most of the the stat requirements out of his gdagger.c as it falls within the realms of normal storable weapons
Tue May  4 18:42:50 1999 changed saber/armor/aura.c to ac2 and weight 3 - now it will be unstorable as it should have been always (plus the weight of 6 before was just plain wierd for an 'aura')

Tue May  4 20:14:24 1999 On the Fakir situation - confirmed he was dc'd by Arrina who was icq'ing with him at the time
Thu May  6 17:39:38 1999 promoted Wocket to level 70 for good work with the CyberNinja guild over the last year. He has gained a lot of knowledge and is a lot more responsible than he was when promo'd to 60

Thu May 20 03:45:22 1999 made wocket/turtleville/OBJ/heal_potion.c and regen_potion.c unstorable. This due to very high power. When storable, high price does not limit quantity as players can save up and go at monsters, quests, and tests with possibly 18 stored. Note that this does not limit quantity as players may buy as many as they want with the money they can gain in a boot (which is nearly limitless given the help of other players)
Thu May 20 04:03:34 1999 moved wocket/std/stand.c to wocket/turtleville/tville_fount.c
Thu May 20 04:07:12 1999 commented stand.c out of wocket/castle.c

Tue Jun  1 19:02:40 1999 approved /beck/MortalKombat/MKMonk.c as a promotion for the new and improved MK tourney to be put on the Green until the tourney begins (unless serious delays develop). Statue will be moved if it causes annoyances

Thu Jun 17 15:11:44 1999 approved ranger weapon cost to 2*KarateLevel + random(KarateLevel), approved an 'encourage' command that unrandomizes karatelevel damage in combat (approved unrandomization of KarateLevel basically)
Thu Jun 24 02:06:34 1999 Due to usagi's repeated logging on for hours with different obscene and annoying names and spamming anyone he could, I reduced him to nothing, along with his other chars.

Sun Jun 27 22:36:52 1999 approved wocket's snail workroom with a change from instablick
Sun Jun 27 23:51:42 1999 approved ranger encourage and tactic multiple player stacking. will keep eye on how it works out
Mon Jun 28 12:49:29 1999 changed /mythos/amon/forest/snake.c to leave if snake weapon is not wielded
Tue Jun 29 18:39:48 1999 cut off 12 rooms full of sergeant by making /hawkeye/room/newbie3.c the end of the newbie area. 200 sergeants, 20 corporals, and 10 privates just does not make sense. there are still 30 low level monsters in the newbie area. If someone wants to make it more interesting, that is fine
Tue Jun 29 18:47:39 1999 set a reset(1) destruct on /pain/NEW/mon/korean.c so they would not fill up MASH
Wed Jun 30 00:02:48 1999 made a bouncer command to keep aggro level 20 monsters out of hawkeye's newbie area. hawkeye/room/newent.c

Mon Jul 12 20:48:04 1999 Changed dreamspeakr/WEDDING/NPC/hera.c wedding message from channel msg to channel junk. It's on the same level as logs rolling
Tue Jul 13 11:47:39 1999 dreamspeakr/mesa/OBJ/rmaker.c changed to 2-handed because it seems logical for a staff and it was causing problems with offwield
Tue Jul 20 13:37:40 1999 approved maledicta's town area for opening - with Eurale's approval of rooms and heals
Thu Jul 22 12:40:13 1999 Promoted Dragnar to level 70 due to his good work with MK, willingness to comply with rules and regulations, and continuing work with a variety of projects

Thu Aug 19 12:33:23 1999 approved zeus/taus/OBJ/onyx_platemail.c for sp gain. it is a hard item to get and is in a pk area. also limited to access by time
Thu Aug 26 13:12:38 1999 Approved Zeus' ~/museum area for test period with logs. The items are pretty exceptional but so are the monsters.
Thu Aug 26 13:19:54 1999 Approved Maledicta's cave ar (dependent on Eurale's approval)
Fri Aug 27 19:23:14 1999 llew/Other/misc/obituary.c added /n to notify_fail message
Sat Aug 28 02:02:52 1999 lew/lounge2.c added an exit to lew/easthall/firstfloor.c since it seems like there should be an exit to there and players need to get to easthall/firstfloor.c to be able to do the quest
Sun Aug 29 14:28:45 1999 Fixed non-functional function in eurale/Cave/cav6.c
Wed Sep 15 13:40:47 1999 Promoted Feldegast from 60 to 70 due to his adopted channel histories
Wed Sep 29 17:47:00 1999 added a freeze to picking the rose in saber/tower/tower20+2.c  - now whoever picks it will be frozen for 60 secs - not necessarily lethal but scary (most of the time frozen, the wraiths are not cloned yet)

Mon Oct 18 17:09:19 1999 Temporarily closed feldegast/arena/npc/vendor1.c due to most heals having a price well below the base price as documented in RULES/heals/heal3 with no apparent approval or justification. If the heals and prices were approved, this injunction will be removed
Sun Oct 24 03:47:17 1999 Changed Obituary Notice to not show deaths of players under level 5 (thus preventing easy spamming and also easy stealing newbie corpses)
Tue Oct 26 15:28:22 1999 Edited the vshadow.c to help ease the bad move_player light problem. instead of the full fix (which would require a lot more code), recommend having vamps reset the guild ob when they encounter a bad exit
Thu Oct 28 13:44:02 1999 /players/saber/armor/overload.c changed to avoid possible abuse (armor dest while keeping ac)
Mon Nov  1 18:29:25 1999 Imprisoned Kazer for multiplaying Melko quest with Blackstar - Blackstar killed all the monsters then Kazer logged in to kill the final monster and get the quest points
Sat Nov 13 03:04:39 1999 Made fishing hat and converse shoes effective as good armor in hawkeye's areas only. might modify later. I know a fishing hat would not protect me from anything other than sunlight on my ears

Wed Dec 15 18:02:37 1999 moved damage in /players/nightshade/weap/hammer.c to weapon class from weapon_hit(). was a wc1 weapon that returned 8+random(10) all the time. now it is simply wc16. this to avoid certain potential abuses related to guild uses
Wed Dec 15 18:18:27 1999 reset daredevil's spell_dam to 0 so he could cast guild spells.. of course a single combat round would do the same and I let him know that

Thu Dec 16 18:50:02 1999 removed a return 1; if the vamp wolf is present on the command levitate. because the doggy is dested doesn't mean the command should stop
Thu Dec 16 18:51:53 1999 jailed Tiffany for incessant tells to me about her failed online relationships after I told her I didn't want to hear about it. she was blaming me for not desting everyone involved
Sat Jan  1 05:41:19 2000 updated Llew's obituary board for Y2K

Sat Jan 15 14:20:02 2000 changed function save_ranger() to SaveRanger() as save_ranger is undefined. in RangerCommunicator.c
Wed Jan 19 17:42:01 2000 Changed Moon's OldTitle to her current level title. was at level 11 title. mailed Beck re: OldTitle updating
Wed Jan 19 20:21:01 2000 Added a missing { in dreamspeakr/WEDDING/NPC/hera.c
Mon Jan 24 12:29:28 2000 Changed room exit 'north' to 'newbie' in persephone/rooms/hall.c  to reduce confusion (there is a trap for non-newbies using the exit but no clue)
Mon Jan 24 12:43:50 2000 persephone/monster/warglea and wwolf.c changed to better fit description and level (coin values reduced on warglea and level raised on wwolf)
Mon Jan 24 13:07:15 2000 Changed navigation commands in junpat2.c and junpatd.c so that players could move around without looking at the room code (it was not very user-friendly)
Fri Jan 28 16:24:46 2000 commented lockrae.c and lockmil.c out of loading in mizan/castle.c these chars no longer log in and the constant call_outs are drain
Tue Feb  1 11:37:51 2000 approved Traff's new version of Delnoch arena (6 of each gladiator type, rather than 6 total, so that both low and high level players can enjoy it)
Fri Feb  4 14:10:22 2000 Changed emerson/mons/manager.c to level 16 from 20. Too hard to justify level 20 on a repeat monster with no description and no logical reason for being powerful. left coins fairly high due to the managers being guarded and wimpy. emerson/weap/pencil.c changed value from 1000 to 300 and wc from 17 to 15. Even if it is a special pencil, it is still a pencil.
Mon Feb  7 12:49:47 2000 altered and restored Spiral's hps to test his unworking wimpy theory. no result
Tue Feb  8 03:42:17 2000 restored 34.7k exp to Arete for double death

Sun Feb 20 22:18:46 2000 re-released Lightning due to Dragnar's release not functioning. actually had to reset his wkrm and home since the free did not work
Sun Feb 27 03:01:49 2000 /players/pathfinder/detroit/monsters/bloodleader.c removed excessive cloning call_out
Tue Feb 29 01:54:34 2000 put check in necromancer dis_burial.h so that it will not function in the town area (this due to aggro spirits killing newbies)
Tue Feb 29 05:49:51 2000 /players/deathmonger/CASTLE/shop.c changed random(800) coin bonus to random(50)
Thu Mar  2 15:47:30 2000 catt/NPC/missionary.c changed alias from repeat of 'missionary' to 'demon'

Sun Mar  5 04:27:28 2000 maledicta/town/rooms/t10.c upped average intelligence for shopkeeper to 20. There is a haggle function that compares shopkeeper int with player int to drop or add price.. with players averaging 20 and shopkeeper averaging 10 (before change), this basically reduced heal prices
Mon Mar  6 13:12:04 2000 closed /players/deus/castle.c until players can logically leave the area without teleporting and some rooms are given fairly clear exit commands. right now it is a trap for anyone who cannot teleport
Mon Mar  6 18:23:43 2000 approved maledicta/nhall newbie hall for player use. changed newbie dispenser in green to be more interesting and move to newbie hall
Mon Mar  6 20:35:47 2000 Changed newbie_dispenser to new format. replaced /obj/bag with pain/NEWBIE/newbie_bag

Sat Mar 11 19:38:38 2000 updated some monsters in Beren's Olgyo area to have a little profit as well. mid-high level area
Sun Mar 12 14:22:52 2000 moved Ultramagnus' castle 1 room west (from vill_shore2 to jetty) so that the south room exit in vill_shore2 will be accessible. were 3 castles based in vill_shore2 and none in jetty, so I moved the castle rather than changed the entrance command
Mon Mar 13 19:12:54 2000 Dune's Amerasu fixed for catch_tell recursion loop
Wed Mar 15 13:41:54 2000 fixed some load errors in Ultramagnus (base object was used rather than clone.. changed to clone)
Wed Mar 15 14:33:28 2000 approved Zeus X area as non-pk
Thu Mar 16 12:43:43 2000 zeus/dealer/room.c commented out dealer until changes are made (dealer should not keep money spent on heals)

Fri Mar 17 14:13:26 2000 Fixed /players/saber/closed/evil/para.c (Yuki's paralysis) so that it no longer causes heartbeat errors on wimpy
Tue Mar 21 03:58:36 2000 promoted Fakir to level 40 for excellent work on second area, continuing contributions to game play ideas (and helping take care of Templar guild), and to help him learn faster. He shows good judgement, good attitude, and willingness to learn.
Thu Mar 23 03:49:29 2000 Changed Issiac hps from 485 to 850, due to the power of the trident of war. it is a very good storable weapon and should not be so easily obtained
Thu Mar 23 16:56:07 2000 Approved Fakir's low level woods area for player use
Fri Mar 24 12:52:12 2000 Changed monsters in hawkeye/monster from evil alignment to neutral, in cases where the description indicates a good or neutral disposition. Changed Pain's korean sapper from good alignment to evil, as this makes sense given the monster's description and circumstances of the area theme. Monsters with evil descriptions were left as evil.
Fri Mar 24 13:43:19 2000 Promoted zeus to level 60 for quest completion and approval, as well as continuing area work
Fri Mar 24 19:06:13 2000 Approved jenny's dukes are for player use
Thu Apr 27 21:08:16 2000 put in required code line for damage types in templar obj

Wed May 17 13:44:32 2000 Added wc bonuses to mourning coil, alchemist, and keeper of the red tower (daranath qualtor)

Fri Jun  8 03:14:58 2001 testing new cyber hide in shadows with snowtest. seems to work as designed
Fri Jun  8 03:23:31 2001 modified the dervish confusion shadow to fully implement the functional changes. The shadow was originally a heartbeat (presumably the heartbeat was failing, thus the change) and now it is changed to a straight call_out. However, heartbeats run on a 3 sec call_out timing so the time in call_out needs to be multiplied by 3 to simulate the original heartbeat specs. so I did that
