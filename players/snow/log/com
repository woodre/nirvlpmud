Fri Aug  6 23:08:25 1999 sticks says: Sticks is now in a position to be a newbie helper, and would like to apply for the position.  Although he has pk set, it is in no way an indication he has intentions of killing those in low levels. I simply wish to expand my areas of hunting, and having pk set should indicate to others I do not fear them, and am perpaired to defend myself at all times. No sence hunting in pk areas without pk set. At any rate, Id like to help true newbies.
