Chaos is an area of great danger and great reward. Some of the monsters have
many coins, full heals, etc. The individual monsters, though some are very
difficult to kill, might not be as tough as their reward might indicate.
However, the monsters in this area cannot be peaced, they can and will gang up
on players, and nothing is predictable. This leads to an extremely high death
rate. Most players are too afraid of Chaos to enter. If the rewards start to
outweigh the risk (i.e. many people entering and none dying), I will adjust
the treasure and power levels accordingly.  - Snow
