Am currently experimenting with a new reincarnation/race format.
Just wanted to warn people not to mess with actual player races
in relation to this concept. Basically, it's fine if you read
the code and have fun with testchars. But if you enable actual
players with it, you will be demoted to non-wiz status. -Snow
