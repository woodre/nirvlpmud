   all healing objects with charges must not save in hotels,lockers,houses,etc.
   The cost of a item with charges will cost players based on following:
   cost=#ofcharges*(cost_per_charge)
   the items will have a minimum weight, weight=#charges/3
   Sobering items, cost=#ofcharges*(cost_per_charge) until the total 
   sobering reaches 30, at which it must be above 10000.
   sobering items will have a weight equal to the number of charges.
Healing Over Time
  Healing over time will cost the same as it would if it were done all at once
  with a small discount of 1 coin for every point healed.
