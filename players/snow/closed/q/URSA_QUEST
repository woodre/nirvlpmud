*Ursa Major Quest*
 
What the players need to do:
 
1) Find the soul of a vampire. This is fairly difficult since the
   souls are found on my dark vampires - which randomly
   clone in my Dark Arena area (pk zone with unpeaceable, fully
   aggressive, following monsters). The entire area is hard to find
   since it is connected through Pain's TinyRealms area.
 
2) Find a cold sphere of healing. Relatively easy. The Ice Spheres
   are found on my Snow Demons (which put up a fairly good fight).
   Snow Demons are, however, found only in one room in a very 
   dangerous area.
 
3) Figure out how to reanimate Ursa Major. Basically, they figure
   that Ursa Major means "big bear" and find the largest of the
   three bears in my areas - the Polar Bear. Once they kill this
   bear, on it is a bear hide that they can wear, eat, or use the
   command "reanimate" with. If they have the Vampire Soul, the
   Ice Sphere, and the Hide, they can reanimate and the quest is
   solved.
