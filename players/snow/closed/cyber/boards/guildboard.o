tmp_text "if you have good ideas about guild emotes, only in room emotesplease mail eurale with it, he asked me to post this note.thank you brethrenDrakkar -Minister**The honor system lately has been the cause of a great dealof trouble within the guild.  The concept of our honorsystem is fantastic, but in order for it to work perfectly,it would have to be used by perfect people. None of us areperfect. When it comes to honor, the concept is so vague andour perceptions are so individualistic, that conflict isinevitable.  The one part of the system that particularlyconcerns me is the dishonor command.  Anything that has anegative connotation is bound to cause problems when it'splayer controlled.  As a solution, I would like to proposethe following modifications:1. Take away the automatic dishonor command.   (I hope that this will eliminate conflicts)2. Take away all degrees of honoring/dishonoring except small.   (This changes the nature of honoring to more of a compliment)3. change the procedure so that any dishonoring, or honoring   to a degree greater than small, must be submitted as a   request to the guild officers (Minister and above).   The request must then be approved by three officers before it   goes into effect.  This should be a coded officer function.   (my reasoning here is that if three officers agree on it, it's   probably a good reason for honoring/dishonoring)I hope that perhaps these suggestions will eliminate futureconflicts about the honor system, and we can become a unifiedteam of killers once again.My $.02,Wulfe, Guard Minister of the CyberNinjas**I believe that as a guild we have lost our focus.  Although Ifully understand, and agree with, the idea that we can choosewhether or not to PK, we must acknowledge that our guild is(or at least was originally intended to be) a PK focused guild.With the loss of the Shardaks as a prime enemy, those of usthat thrive on PK are left somewhat bored by that aspect ofthis game.  The problem, I believe, is that we no longer haveanyone we love to hate.  We loved to hate the Shardaks,everyone did.  But in doing so, we have turned into a bit toomuch of a goodie two shoes kind of guild.  Say the wordCyberNinja... does that sound like a goodie guild to you? No.We were originally intended to be heartless, cold-bloodedcalculating killers.  The original members of this guild wereexactly that, and were damned good at it.  We have lost thatedge, that attitude, and it grieves me.  We need a focus, andthe MUD needs a new guild to love to hate.  I am proposing thatwe abandon our nice sweet cuddly nauseating path that we seemto be following now, and get back to the days when CyberNinjaswere feared throughout the MUD, yet noone could set theirPK flag fast enough because they were dying (literally) to gettheir hands on us.  In the past they used kid-killing, pet-killing,corpse-stealing, and whatever else they could to motivate peopleto come after them, to set PK, to attack them in the Wastelands.And they had the time of their lives doing it!!  Granted, someof us personally object to pet killing or kid killing, just likesome of us don't want to PK, but that's a personal decision.Ninjas aren't built to be toe-to-toe honorable pkers, notice ourabilities to see who's in battle, to see in the dark, to hidein the shadows!  We are a guild meant to work together to useteamwork to bring fear to others!  I want our attitude back,and I want to know how you all feel about it.  I have quite abit of unofficial support, but I really want to know what youall think, so that perhaps we can get some of the built-in honorrestrictions removed.Once again,Wulfe, Guard Minister of the CyberNinjas**Because of an apparent lack of guild issue resolution,the following guild law is now in order: The Court of Ninjas.For each guild conflict/issue there will be two postings that reflect the facts and opinions of each side of the issue.There must be only one posting per side of the issue, so eachside should be sure to present an accurate and well-representedarrangement of ideas in its posting. The header of each postingshould include the pre-title of "Issue #(argument): ", where# is to be a number starting at 1.Comments by others at a later time can be added to one of thepostings (that they support) in a reposting. This means that theprevious posting must be removed for a new posting.The arbiter(s) of an issue can make judgement once both postingsare on the board. The pre-title of judgement postings (which theremust only be 1 posting of) is to be "Issue #(resolution): ".Note: arbiters MUST be neutral (not belonging to either side ofthe issue).Arbiters can be any ONE the following groups:1 Shogun, 1 Minister, or council of 3 Senseis.Once a judgement has been made, all other future judgements arenull and void. However, judgements may be over-ruled by aShogun (if the arbiter was a Minister or Sensei Council),Regent (if the arbiter was a Shogun or lower), or an Emperor.**The Court of Ninjas is now an actual CyberNinja guildoperation. It is in the guild documentation:'cyber operationmenu'Dune**I would just like to further clarify my position on guild focus.I had to leave rather abruptly last night, and may not have totallymade myself clear.  I DO NOT want us to become like the Shardaks were.We are a guild of assassins, we kill for revenge, we kill for honor,and we kill for profit, we do not just randomly slaughter. Keep inmind that kill stealing is -extremely- profitable, both for xp andfor coins.  That is why I support that behaviour, it seems to meto be appropriate to our theme.I also want to emphasize that I don't want us just randomly picking onpeople.  I believe we should not victimize newbies, nor should we justpick on anyone... the whole idea here is to make the game fun andchallenging, I do NOT want us to ruin anyone's enjoyment of this game.Pick on people who you know might set PK, who are aggressive and willingto fight back.Another point I want to greatly stress is that I really reallyDO NOT WANT US TO BE A GUILD OF FLAPPERS AND WHINERS!To me, flapping and whining are both dishonorable offenses,punishable through the honor system.  Don't arrogantly proclaim yoursuperiority over every channel, shut your mouth and go prove it.We should be SILENT killers, our actions should speak louder thanwords.  Make your bite feared, and don't bark at all.Thanks,Wulfe, Guard Minister of the CyberNinjas**A few notes on PK... a fair fight is a stupid fight.  Don't fight fair,fight to win.  Work with each other to get kills.  'ncon' will show youhow your teammates are doing, use a chatter box or the guild channel tokeep in touch with each other, have one person hide in shadows and fourothers ready to use 'transto' to go attack on cue.  Organization,precision, and information are our strengths... use them!  Another thing,disconnection, running, logging out, guild escapes, these are things thatkeep PKers alive!  Don't criticize yourself or your opponent for usingthem! Almost every stupid flap conversation I hear is started with thephrase "bah we had you, you disconnected, you suck!" or some other similarcrap.  Knowing when to use those methods is part of a pker's skill.Use every available method to win, and DON'T WHINE when people use thosesame methods to escape you.  Doing so is dishonorable!  Shut up and hit themfaster and harder next time, so they can't escape.Thanks,Wulfe, Guard Minister of the CyberNinjas**I believe if we are going to have a new location for our guild then it should be in a pk zone.  On this note why don't we slap our old enemies in the face and have the location some where in the wastes.Protection for a price,Master**Honored Ninjas -	This is my first note as your new Daimyo, and I haveto say that I consider it both a privilage and a honor to serve the guild in this manner.  I hope to bring back some ofour more time-honored abilities, namely, the martial arts forms and combinations, as well as possibly help redesignthe guild hall.  If I can find the time in real life to putinto this guild, you will see some nice things soon.  ;>	I must say that I like the new leadership that isrising out of this guild with members like Wulfe steppingforward and being willing to take charge.  I hope we gaina Shogun worthy of working with the leadership to our benefit also.  	On the issue of moving the guild, that was my idea,and Dune liked it.  I feel that traditionally Ninjas werelocated in the mountains or hidden away from society, notin some blatent place anyone could reach.  They used theirskills for protection, power, and profit.  We are much likethe traditional Ninjas, with the advantage of CyberneticEnhancements to augment our already incredible physicalabilities.  We embrace the traditions of the old Ninja clans,while at the same time moving forward.  	I would like to say that with Dune's approval, Iwill award a special title(with color) to the player whoselects the site most appropriate for our guild location.  Each of you can only submit 1 location, andonce submitted, you cannot change it to another, so think hard before submitting the change.  Post yourideas for location on the idea board and Dune will review them.  The location can be anywhere in Dune orSnow's realms.	Mail me with any guild suggestions, please4bear in mind that I don't have a ton of time right nowto do much, but I do intend to do quite a bit in the coming months.	Thank you for your time.				-Lord Reflex the Daimyo**I would like to see the guild located high upon Snow'smountain area, above even the fortress.  This allowsus some seclusion, access to some really wicked monsters,it's appropriate for our guild, and since the area iscurrently fairly simple, I think it could be a primeplace to put in a new PK area around the guild, whichI hope will happen sometime in the future.Wulfe, Guard Minister of the CyberNinjas**I'm not sure why the guild has to move, I kinda favor where it is now... allows easy access to nice heals and makes us be totally ready for battle alot quicker.  This also allows us to bang people while they are getting heals... which is always funny..But if it has to move, I would rather see it put within the Dune's area...   I would tell ya the name, but I can't spell it right...  something like Lotherian OraclehehI would like to see the area around the guild to be full pk, because I wish to be able to protect my guild with my life, and not have to rely on some coding tricks and wingdings.  Anyone heard of Omni? heh.. imagine our guild entrance there:) woot woot-Shiv**ok, i personally like where the guild hall is, BUT, if we have to change, i think it would be cool tohave it underground, and we could have a command to travel underground, and have a holw new 'CyberWorld'... just something to think about.**I'd like the new guild headquarters to be entered through a one-way pk area.  With the only exit from the pk area is into the guild hall  and i'd like the guild hall only enterable by guild members.  I think it would be a perfect trap.waiting to set his pk.Hugh**i'm going inactive for another 2 wks, most/all of you don't know me, so .... anyway, email me at kbilly@erols.com; if any1 is interested in the actor robert duvall, of "godfather" and the newly released apostle, my web site is www.erols.com/kbilly/ ...later,INACTIVITY4EVER,\/ [- |2 -|-**WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTIME TO DROP YOUR SOCKSANDGRAB YOUR COCKS......CAUSE WE COMIN AT YA WITH FULL FORCE!!!-The Rooster-**The new guild is open!!Use the updater, in this room, to update yourself.**All guild variables will be transferred over to the new guildexcept for the following:honor will be reset, this is because the change to the very    old version of this guild wiped out honor anywayspecial configurations will be reset: this means all auto's    will not be saved, which is no big deal anywayEverything else will transfer over correctly.**My implants apparently are rusty now thateveryone is upgraded to teflon.
