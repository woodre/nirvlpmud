I leave tomorrow to head back to what was home. I don't know what will happen and if/when I will be able to come back. i understand that you need a Shogun present to lead you into battles and deal with everyday strains. Fight fierce, family, I will return one day and be colder than I have been before now.I'm on the shortend of Life's stick at the moment. But as always, I will prevail in one way or the other. I hope I can find a way to stop in here occasionally and keep my status. Time till only tell.--Shiverheart the Cybernina Shogun         Cyberninja too:)**okay.. i can post on this board..   -pan**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
