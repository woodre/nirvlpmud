Notes posted on one board will be seen by all.Feel free to use this board for all appropriate matters.**Hey....I know some of you guys are leaving/have left the Shardak Alliance....great i guess...*shrug* whateva, but some of us are in it and plan on staying...don't even try to force us out of it...There is no need to start shit like that...you guys that do nothing but pk, i fully understand why and hope ya kill them all....I have more ties with the Shardak and all....So i will be staying for a while longer...dunno what i am gonna do eventually.  My plans are to wiz and i hope i can help out our guild...i am tired of not having a wiz here....for several reasons.  Most of you know tht i am also Caleab, so you can talk to me as such.BTW...we Sensei's need to be on a bit more, some of these guys need training, and can't get it...you prolly know what that is like...thanks Gren and Falcon for logging in and asking over net...'Anyone need training??'  Mode also....hehe  *snicker* some of you others, we have to track down and almost beg...that sucks...Shiv/Caleab (soon to be a sensei)**How lon are we goin to sit around and tlet the shardaks build their strengths then attack us. We should start kicking their asses soon, we cant let em get tougher and we know we got the best pkers. so lets do something about it. tell me what you think.**It has begun, the end is close to the shardak. They have wronged the wrong ppl. Mode and I will actively attack all shardaks. I have resurected myself only to find that my circuits were somewhat disoriented.I went to the Chop and got a check up, and have found that i suffer from Cyberpsychosis. This is a disease that happens when you are overloaded with cybernetics. It will not take my life, but makes me enraged and forces my circuitry to sorta flip out. The only thing it knows it loyality to true Cyberninjas, excluding those that kill other Cninjas' kids.  I do not know what will come to be in the future....                              but i will control it as long as i can hold it back.Friends like you come one a dozen....                                     Shiverheart**fear that message by you shiver. I am glad to see cybers are dominating the mud once again. lets all keep up the good work.**Where art all my bros and sises?
