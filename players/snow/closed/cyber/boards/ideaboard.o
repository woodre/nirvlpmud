tmp_text "Ok, I am getting all your input and I thought I would make anote of what is being implemented, what isn't, and why.First, the weapons will not be made any more powerful. They arepushing the limits already.The offer command has been removed due to the possibility ofabuse. The weapons are disposed of automatically.Potions that alter alignment I disagree with in principle soI will not be making any. I have, however, made several monstersof good alignment that are not difficult to kill in my beachareaBreaking weapons, altering opponent stats, paralyzation have allbeen given the nix by higher ups so they will not be implementedAttack mode and set strike are both found in the scan commandI have put in the attack modes so a variation of styles is available in combat.I did change the power emotes as well.That's about it. -Snow** laughs so hard his FluX generators spark!grins cybernetically.bows honorably to you.I have these in my quicktyper already... I have them set as follows:claughcgrincbowIt would be nice to have the option of directing these at people, solo, or use them at people in other rooms :)I would love to see these put into our daemon.. woo.. let's go guys.. give some more ideas.--Shiv the Shogun**I hate for this to sound totally and uterlly sarcastic and rude, but please please! fix this guild...it has had so many error and things that have had to be removed that it is becoming less and less fun to play with.  I come back and the goportal as well as the guild teleportation room is removed, as well as the immersion room and the mech prices raised...if everything is so illegal why aren't the rules changed.  Nothing is possible anymore with this guild and I wonder when it is going to change??		XENA , loyal cyberninja***Xena -	Nothing was removed.
