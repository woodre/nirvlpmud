Matter Converter
Usage: conversion
       overload


    The matter converter is a miniature power plant imbedded
in a body's musculature. It feeds off of body's physical matter
and releases energy into its environment. It costs no sps to
start or stop. 'conversion' is a toggle command.
    These devices can be forced to overload and burn extreme amounts
of matter. This can be dangerous yet effective when used in combat.
