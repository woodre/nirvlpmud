Electric Flux
Usage: eflux


     Electric flux is the ability to create massive electric fields
in the air, causing localized electrical breakdown... upon a certain
target.  A few hi-tech charge plates are installed inside your body,
which causes this flux upon command.  Flux damage varies with quality
level.
