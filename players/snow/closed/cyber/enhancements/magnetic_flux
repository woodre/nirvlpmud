Magnetic Flux
Usage: mflux


     Magnetic flux is the creation of large magnetic fields and
changing electrical potentials which, when centered on a chosen
target, causes severe organic disruption.  Magnetic flux, as with
all fluxes, are installed inside the body, unseen from the 
outside.  Damage varies with quality level.
