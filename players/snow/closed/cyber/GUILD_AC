The CyberNinja guild ac works according to Martial Art Level.
The function is: ac = random(artlevel/2) + 1
The maximum artlevel = 16.
This ac function is called on a call_out of 5 during combat
so it is continually shifting.
I am considering an enhancement for the guild which will add 1
to guild ac.
Without the enhancement, player ac would be randomly 1-8.
With the enhancement, ac would be 2-9.
CyberNinja guild ac makes armor of any sort useless. Therefore,
their average ac of 5.5 with maxed guild level and enhancement
is more of a drawback for any serious fighting than a bonus.
Considering that maximum artlevel costs at least 2 million xp
and below that ac is lower according to the formula, this is
a rather severe drawback and guild ac is something that
no player interested in max combat effectiveness would choose
to have.  -Snow
