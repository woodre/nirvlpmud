holosetting "  You have entered a beautiful marble room.  The floors, ceiling and walls are all made of the puriest marble. There are several statues lining the walls.  The statues are of the great Cyberninjas from the times past and present.  Each name is written in black, with solid gold traces outlining each name. Surveying the room, you can read such names as Laplander, Jenny, Falcon, Nightraver, Quozl, Fury, Wulfe, Shiverheart, and Massa.  There are beautiful rugs around the floor and the only furniture are a few contemporary looking futon beds, all set up to look like couches.    This is the main room of the current Shogun.  The mighty Shiverheart stands with you."
