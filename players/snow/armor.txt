Problem:  too easy to obtain max ac from armor shops. This leads to
          lower relative value of ac4, ac5 armor obtained from powerful
          monsters. Also, no need for good ac2 helmets etc. This is yet
          another reason why players will not fight powerful monsters
          and only want to fight monsters with coins.

Idea:     lower ac of armor in armor shops, raise weight of same. Thus,
          players will realize that good armor has value again and will
          fight special monsters for special equipment. Also, not all
          articles of clothing must provide protection. A pinky ring,
          for example, should not provide the same amount of protection
          as a shield. A tee shirt should not provide protection like a
          chainmail jerkin. It would be good to have clothing items and
          non-magical accessories be ac0 - realistically their worth as
          armor. Thus, people will have to search for the magical ring
          of protection or amulet of defense and will want to save an
          accessory that is ac1. Warning: if these 'special' accessories
          are sold in shops, the entire effort is wasted.
