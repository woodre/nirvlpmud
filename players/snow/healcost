This is an expansion to Wocket's original idea of fair healing / tox ratios
for multi-use heals.  The problem was that, though healing amount remained
constant, total heal tox increased with higher-use, lower healing heals.
For example, a 5-use, 30 heal, 10 tox would tox a total of 50 while healing
150 whereas a 3-use, 50 heal, 10 tox would tox a total of 30 while healing
150. This proposes a total tox / total heal ratio for cost to replace the
current per-use tox cost as detailed below.

Intox / Cost
.40+    08
.35     10
.31     11
.28     12
.26     13
.24     14
.22     15
.20     16
.18     17
.16     18
.14     20
.12     22
.08     30
.04-    40

With this table, a 5-use, 30 heal, 10 tox would cost 50/150 = .3 = 12 coins
per heal point for a total of 1800 coins. A 3-use, 50 heal, 10 tox would cost
30/150 = .2 = 16 coins per heal point for a total of 2400 coins.

Note: I did add 2 cost categories at the top and 2 at the bottom to
accommodate the wider range of intox provided by this method.
Note2: Wizzes should round to the _higher_ price on the scale.
