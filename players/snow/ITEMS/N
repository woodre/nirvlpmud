messages "aliases/nicknames/do cmds, oh my.(vertebraker):**If you can read this, you probably have already learned thatwe've upgraded from the quicktyper system to the spiffy NEWsystem, where you don't need any of those fancy things!Ja, and also.. we have nicknames.Read more about it by typing "help character"and investigating the "Automation" section.and mail me with bugs.and um..  if it doesn't work .. re-log and seewhat happens .. and if it STILL doesn't work,talk to a wizard.**offer spell(vertebraker):**Those of you whose guilds do not prohibit game-spellsmay "offer" corpses to the gods of Nirvana for a smallreward.  It takes only a very minor magical efforton your part [1 sp].**consider cmd(vertebraker):**For those of you who are either unguilded, or belong to guildsthat don't prohibit you from using "mud spells",Type "consider <target>" to gauge someone's AC, WC, and HP.Of course, there is a cost..   5 sps for newbies, 10 for everybody else.			verte**Megalith expands(wren):**Seek the Megalith, a new feature has popped up.Enjoy, happy hunting...--Wren**Fran's laboratory(francesco):**"What? Did Fran open his laboratory for visitors to see?""Yes, seems so.""I also heard that there are some hidden features in it.""Yes, not only experience/coins.""Quest points, maybe?""Who knows, might be worth to go there and check.""Yea, will do as soon as possible.""Nod, me too. Bye, take care.""You too. Bye."(faithfull report of a talk heard in the University Cafeteria)**The Lost Cities Quest(dune):**I have redone the Lost Cities Quest (go to Lothlorien Oracle).Actually, to be more accurate, I've simplified this quest.It has been rennovated, and the quest clues are much mucheasier to figure out. If you are currently working on the quest,not to worry, all your Sithi Stones are still required.Seek the garden of Amerasu, and there, say you will help her.Evil is stirring in Lothlorien, can you save the Sithi?Dune**cpl new notes(vertebraker):**"yoda" is back working as it did before.I also added 'nexp' to the list of variables for your personal combatmonitor.  You can use that to see how much experience you will needfor the next level, without even typing "xpnext".Isn't that cool?**The dragon sleeps deep within the earth(catacomb):**Hear ye! Hear ye!  Nahog has made another glyph within the forgotten cave.  Seek out the mighty dragon deep in the Durkor caverns.Catacomb, Lord of Sivartp.s. For you lazy players the directions to the forgotten cave are 6w,3s,4w,4s,w**Templar Castle(jaraxle):**& Tower of Hope, are now located:6w,3s,4w,5s,w of the green.**PK CHANGES!!! (updated!)(boltar):** Over the last couple weeks I have noticed that free pk has had a very disturbing effect on the mud that I do not like. It has also resultedin casual pk which I don't think works well with those who take PK seriously. So, pk will now be as follows: Unless a level loss cap is reached, the defeated player will loose 1/6of his exp. The victor will gain 1/30 of that loss. So if a 2,000,000exp player is killed, the dead player looses 333,333 exp or less if the level cap is hit. the victor gains 11,111 exp. or 1/30 of what is lost if level cap his hit.Corpse creation and equipment and coin loss will be normal. Normal lossof an attribute will also occur.  I think these changes back towards what we had, will help restore theprevious game play. Changes will automatically go in at the next reboot, soonerif files get reloaded, so proceed as if they are already in effect.8-Nov-2002 22:40 CST. Because some people may have set pk under the old rules, a one-use-onlyturn off is available. Simply type:  turnoffpk **update to treasure (revised)(boltar):** I've revised this note because there has been some confusion regarding the change. What occurs is when you type save or seethe auto save message 10 items that are either weapons or armorsthat are easily savable are recorded in case of a crash or mishapthat destroys your player object. The items must be in the directinventory and not in a bag.  This is *NOT* an on player storage system. This is *NOT* even closeto what the rumors say. It is simply an enhancement to the treasuresystem for crashes. It is something I came up with a couple weeks ago. It is an attempt to prevent crashes from being as damaging.  Storage of items will be advance by long running casino hotel program that addresses the desire for greater storage. This program has beenon going since sept. That said, I repeat my previous warning on the new code, This may produce some interesting bugs, but I think I've got it prettywell covered from the get go. Keep in mind some objects simply won'tsave properly so they won't be restored. All items not stored will result in cash as normal.**addition to brief toggle(boltar):**  The brief toggle now has a third setting, 'detail mode'  currentlythis adds the title of the room above the long, and may be expanded to other info in the future. (er long description) there is anansi pref for room title as well which may be set after you enterdetail mode for the first time. the suggestion for the room title came from coldwind, but Idecided to make it part of a third brief mode. **corpse stealing (revised)(boltar):** From nelk's suggestion, I have made it so that the slayer of recordhas 2 heart beats (4 seconds) to get the corpse before it's free-game. This should cut down on the corpse stealing, but still allow the truelyskillful to pull it off.**death squence additions(boltar):**  Long wanting to add to the death squence, I got an idea today.When a player dies, a tunnel of light will appear. The dead may enterthis tunnel and take it back to the village green. Hope it's useful, butI just made cause I thought it would be a cool thing...**daycare fix/change(boltar):**  Before you got to use 2 kids per reboot, if one died, you couldn't takeout another. I have changed this such that you may have two *living* kidsout at a time. That is, if one gets killed you may take out a third. Hopefully this will work well.**cross-reboot saving (revised)(boltar):** Leveraging the work done to save weapons and armor through a crash, the same number of items (~6 or 7) savable weapons and armors willbe retained if they are on your person when forced to quit becauseof a reboot. Note this ONLY applies to a reboot. nothing elseYou cannot quit out early or the items will be lost, you must let armageddonthe game crasher to force you to quit.I hope this is found helpful. I hope to further expand the crash savingand cross-reboot saving in the near future. However, diku-mud-like savingon the player will not occur, other arragements will be putinto place(note your log in time must be 3:45 pm CST / 4:45 EST or later for thisto work. To get the new code you must fully quit (no reconnect) and log in)**crash/reboot item saving(boltar):**    I have been able to expand these features to include the first 10 items in a player's inventory that save in the lockers. If it successfullysaves in the lockers it should save at the last save one does before acrash or when army quits a person out at reboot.**new commands(boltar):** itemtest  This command is used to list out what the crash/reboot code will record from your inventory for restoration. cashmoney  This command will allow you to take money from your score and convert it into an object in your inventory.(note to get back into your score you will need to put it in  a bag or drop it, then pick it up again. This may be streamlined in the future.)**Wheel of Time(boltar):**  The Wheel of Time is open again with permission of it's creator. If there are any problems with the area please see me, as one of the conditions is a restricted access to the code. It is now located 3 N of it's previous location.**hotel lost and found(boltar):**  As of the next reboot, items that fall out of a hotel room may appear in the lost and found 1e of the lobby. posted 18-nov-2002 23:30 CST**coins(boltar):** I have changed how the coin limit works.The limit is still 80k. However it simply will block people from gettingmore coins once they have more than 80k. in other words if you getup 150k from a crash. you will simply be unable to get more coins.but the 150K will stick until you spend your way down.**cyber invis changes(boltar):**I have added a series of level and attrib checks. If a non-cyber issuperior he will be able to see the cyber in the shadows.It's a player vs. player check, I am going to keep the exact method to myselfbut stealth and intelligence as well as one's level are important**upgrade for cosmo's VDS exp list(boltar):**  I have upgraded and fixed the existing problem with the VDS.With a small addition to the code, the limitation that forced it toupdate the annual list only once per reboot has been removed. The VDS will now update every 3 hours and at reboot time as before.**It's purge time again(boltar):**  I am going to go and purge all player files inactive for more than oneyear. I will try my usual process of if I remember the name, I will move it to inactive. I already did names begining with a,b,and c. However I then decided to post a list. log in to make sure yourcharacter doesn't get purged, spread the word, whatever. do 'help purge2002' to see the list.  It's long, as I haven't done a purgesince this time last year.**additions to multiple(boltar):**  I have added a paragraph to 'help multiple'.read it.that is all**Player-Wizard Liaison(aingeal):**Hello!I will be acting as the "official" liaison between players andwizards.  If you have any thoughts, suggestions, complaints,problems, or minor emergencies, please let me know or (if possible) leave me a mudmail, and I will either addressthe issue or make sure that the wizard who is able to addressthe issue is made aware of it.  I'm happy to answer any questions (within the limits of the rules governing wizards, of course), and in short will be delighted to assist in any way I canto help keep Nirvana running smoothly and to keep itfun for everyone.Yours in service,Aingeal**new command, findsize(boltar):**Some people have been annoyed by not knowing what size they are forarmor before trying the armor on. the command findsize will calculateyour size so you know in advance. Sizes are XXL,XL,L,M,S,XS You may wear your size and one size bigger. **"
