Good to see yet another original making it back to us. Also, anyonewho logs in and sees me (Chip) on, and is bored of playing alone, let me know. If I'm active atthe time, I'll gladly log one of my players in to join the fun. Gotta liven this place upsome more! Hell, bring your friends! They don't know the meaning of a good, social, and imaginitivegame until they've tried mudding. And this, my friends, is one of the originals, est. February of 1991. That'scoming up on 22 years of constant change and development! Know of any other computer games, especially online games,that have lasted this long? Of course not. For the most part, every developer here started asa player, and had a good idea of what players wanted and needed! And what's left of us still tryour best to keep all of that in mind when creating new things and conjuring up new ideas. Anyway,we hope everyone's enjoying their time here, and hope to see many more new faces, as well as returningghosts from the past. Welcome (or welcome back) to Nirvana LPMud!Chip**Kame's Tower(mosobp):**Hello all,Kame's Tower has made the long awaited presence in the land of Namek.

It will now show items that willsave when you quit the game with a [S] flag, similarto how kept items works.If an item is kept, it will still show the [K] flag infront of the obj short description. If it is an itemthat will be saved, the K will be GREEN. If not it willbe YELLOW.I also changed the way items are saved. Items that arekept will be saved before anything else. So "keep eq"will ensure that your gear is saved before heals etc.(that are not kept) when you quit the game.Please note, your saved items only updates when yourautosave kicks in or you do a save. If something doesn'tlook right in your inv do a save then check inv again.A kept item should only be YELLOW if you have more than the max number of items kept, or if you have not yet saved.Let me know if you run into any issues, hope youenjoy the updates.--Gnar**Vending Machine(Feb 12, 2015 Sami):**A vending machine has appeared in sami's demon portal. exciting new items await those who like the dark.--*Sami*--**coinmerge(Jun 15, 2015 Fred):**I have updated the coinmerge command.
