Ran into a few peeps on Facebook and wanted to check in so I downloaded an app and checked it out...8)\n\n\n**\nRe: Hello!(jareel)(chip):\n**\nth\nStill some of us around man! Good to see yet another original making it back to us. Also, anyone\nwho logs in and sees me (Chip) on, and is bored of playing alone, let me know. If I'm active at\n\nthe time, I'll gladly log one of my players in to join the fun. Gotta liven this place up\nsome more! Hell, bring your friends! They don't know the meaning of a good, social, and imaginitive\ngame until they've tried mudding. And this, my friends, is one of the originals, est. February of 1991. That's\ncoming up on 22 years of constant change and development! Know of any other computer games, especially online games,\nthat have lasted this long? Of course not. For the most part, every developer here started as\na player, and had a good idea of what players wanted and needed! And what's left of us still try\n\nour best to keep all of that in mind when creating new things and conjuring up new ideas. Anyway,\nwe hope everyone's enjoying their time here, and hope to see many more new faces, as well as returning\nghosts from the past. Welcome (or welcome back) to Nirvana LPMud!\n\nChip\n\n**\nPrestige Levels(dragnar):\n**\nI am putting together a proposal to implement prestige levels.\nPrestige would be when a player reaches 19+100 they have the\nOPTION to reset their character to level 1 and default stats.\nThey would then be Prestige level 1.  Player then can level\nup just like a new character.  \nI am looking for ideas on abilities/bonuses that would be \ngranted to the player for prestige levels.  What would\nmotivate you guys to reset a +100 character and start\nagain?  Most characters are no longer played once they \nare maxxed, and I want that to change.  \nPlease send me your ideas through mudmail or email\njohnniebillings@gmail.com.  Please keep me mind that\nwe still have to have some kind of balance, and we\nhave to get this proposal approved.\nThanks.\n\n**\nSurvival Gear(dragnar):\n**\nWhat gear would you want during a Zombie Apocalypse?\nIf you send me an item, and a decent 2 - 6 line description\nit might end up in the game.  I'll even give you credit for it.\nMudmail or email me.\n--Dragnar\n\n**\nKame's Tower(mosobp):\n**\nHello all,\n\nKame's Tower has made the long awaited presence in the land of Namek.
