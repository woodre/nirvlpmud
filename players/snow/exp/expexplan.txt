EXPERIENCE FORMULA CHANGE

WHY?
Currently, monster exp is level-driven, with little relation
to stats such as hp, wc, or ac. There is also a high-end limit
of close to 8k. Thus, extremely powerful monsters such as
Icingdeath or Masakado are worth the same (or possibly less)
than a standard level 20 monster.

The experience award for powerful monsters is horribly low for
the risk involved in killing them. Thus, players have little
incentive to fight the big monsters, or to party.

Monster experience should be related to monster power. A monster
that can easily kill a level 19 player should be worth much more
than monsters a level 19 can mow through with no risk or effort.

Thus, I propose a new experience formula, based on monster stats
rather than level. The new formula will not have a high end limit.
Instead, extremely powerful monsters will be worth a lot more than
normal monsters. There will be different exp rewards among the
current level 20 monsters, based on their particular power (hp,
wc, and ac).

EFFECT
For the standard monsters, the difference is small. Exp gains are
similar for standard levels 1-20. Currently approved monsters will
vary in exp return based on actual power. Some level 20 monsters
will be worth more than others, because they are more powerful.

NEEDS
Wizzes with exceptional monsters will need to add the exceptional
bonuses - hp, wc, ac to get the exp credit for those. I will make
another doc explaining how the bonuses should be determined. These
bonuses will require the addition of 1 line of code for each.
