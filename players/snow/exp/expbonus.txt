APPLICATION OF BONUS FACTORS

HP_BONUS

This is for cases where a monster has limited healing
based on hit points. For example, a monster with 1000
hit points heals itself for 500 hit points once, when
it goes below 400 hit points. This would be a 500
hp_bonus: set_hp_bonus(500);
*NOTE this is different from regen/healing.

WC_BONUS

This is for cases where a monster does extra damage
outside of spell_dam. Addition to wc_bonus should be
based on average damage per heartbeat. For example,
30% chance of hit_player(40) would do an average of
12 damage per heartbeat. If less than 1, there is no
bonus. Hit_player will have wc_bonus of 1 per point
per heartbeat (so the above case would be 12).
Add_hit_point will be 1.5 per point (due to ignore
armor), and heal_self damage will be 2 per point (due
to no armor and sp drain).
wc_bonus: set_wc_bonus(12);

AC_BONUS

This is for cases of regen healing outside of standard
set_heal (heal rate, heal intv). If resistances code is
in play, it will need its own doc relating to this, or
it can be hard coded. For regen healing, bonus is hit
points added per heartbeat * 2. For example, healing
3 hit points every 2 heartbeats would give 3 points to
the ac_bonus. Again, this is nonstandard healing.
Another possibility would be potential bonuses to ac
by heartbeat. For example, if the monster gained 20 ac
for a limited time, you would determine the average ac
bonus from that special ability. Each additional average
ac point would add 1 to ac_bonus.
ac_bonus: set_ac_bonus(3);
