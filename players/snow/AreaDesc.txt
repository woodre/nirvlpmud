Areas:
 * Nature
   * Beach ----- This Midlevel beach area has some
                   aggressive wolves and killer whales,
                   as well as fairly easy seals.
                   High level players may wish to explore
                   the surf.
   * Mountain -- A High level area, Snow Mountain has a
                   couple caves and a Fortress. The caves
                   present fair challenges, while the
                   Fortress contains several deadly
                   creatures. A group of Knights are also
                   found about the mountain, each with
                   powerful steel armor and weapons.
                   Assess monsters carefully before
                   attacking, and be prepared to fight
                   when exploring.
                   The Mystic Dispenser in the Fortress
                   provides heals and more.
   * Desert ---- A link to Quantos' desert area, which has
                   fairly low level monsters, an oasis pub,
                   and some strange obelisks.
 * Newbie ------ As the name implies, links to a newbie
                   area. Snowflakes for true beginners,
                   Snowmen for the bolder newbies.
 * Chaos ------- High level area, random movement, random
                   monsters. Be sure to understand how to
                   get out before you enter. This is a pk
                   area with some great returns, as well
                   as some nasty monsters.
 * Shadowgate -- Mid-High level area, random movement,
                   random shadow creatures, a shadow
                   fortress with a powerful Shadow King.
                   Escape from this area is not readily
                   apparent and should be considered a
                   mini-quest type area.
 * Arena ------- This is the Dark Arena, a graveyard area
                   with fearsome undead creatures. Fight
                   or die. This area provides potentially
                   high exp gain, and is also pk.
 * Test -------- If you think you are the best fighter on
                   this mud, here is the place to prove it.
                   The Elemental Test will pit you against
                   some of the most powerful monsters you
                   will ever see. Bring plenty of heals,
                   since you can't stop until you win, quit,
                   or die.
