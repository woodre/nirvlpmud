Attempt for standardized weapon classes

3:  hands
5:  sap, brass knuckles
7:  dagger, small club
10: medium club, short sword
12: broadsword
14: longsword, large spiked club
15: bastard sword
16: two-handed sword, polearms (naginata, pike, halberd, etc)

Quality craftsmanship, magical nature, very large size would raise weapon
class above the standard. There should be a reason for craftsmanship, magic,
and/or size. If a weapon is large, it should weigh more. If it is high quality
or magic, it should be very valuable.

This would preclude a wc18 dagger found on a common villager and worth 30 coins.
It would encourage a wc18 mithral longsword as treasure worth 3k or more.

Monsters should not have maximum storable power weapons as standard items,
as this makes weapons all the same and pretty worthless in general.
Weapon class 15 should be a decent weapon. If players will only use weapons of
class 16 or above, then there is no point in having the 15 classes below that.
Magical and very high quality items should be very rare. As in, players should
have to do a fair bit of work to get a magical weapon. This opposed to walking
to just about any monster with a weapon and getting the maximum storable power
with little effort (level 5 can kill most).
