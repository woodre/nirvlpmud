Approval Notes
for Stark's Forest area
by Feldegast

  First of all, I really like the theme of this area, more than any of
the areas that I've approved so far.  The smaller monsters seem to
lead up to bigger ones, which is the way it should be.  There's hidden
stuff, such as the snakes, and disguised entrances.  Best of all, each
of the monsters is unique.  You didn't even seem to have any technical
problems.  Unfortunately, your weak point seems to be spelling and
grammar.  I've listed a series of technical corrections, but you also
had some descriptions that were just poorly phrased and sounded odd.
For the most part, I just ignored those due to time constraints, but
you might want to have somebody you know look through your area and
make a few suggestions.

Rooms
------------
forest1.c

  Why is 'east' not an obvious exit?  There is a path leading that way.
Just because I want them to look around.
  The second sentence uses the past tense rather than present.
  In the third sentence, there is no subject.
merged
  Typo "vegetion".

forest2.c

  Typo "thing".
fixed
  Capitalize "trees".  Why are the trees screaming?
fixed and altered
  Typo "fomerly".  Typo "nurish".
fixed

forest3.c

  Am I currently standing on the log from forest2.c, or have I crossed
it yet?  You might want to make this clearer.
done
  Perhaps it should be "at the sand" rather than "and the sand".
done
  In the description of "fabric", typo "opresive".
fixed

forest4.c

  Typo "it's" should be "its".
fixed
  Is the "sand" "finely grounded" or "finely ground"?
ground
  In "rock" and "boulder", you should break that up into two sentences.
broken
  In the climb command, you should remove the period from the emote
 section of the move_player function.  A period is appended 
 automatically.  It is a little annoying having to guess which functions
 append what, but you'll get used to it.
tell me about it.. yeesh  So THIS one puts the period in... but NOT the \n?

water.c

  AN open cave.
  Regarding the final sentence, if I'm already in a cave, then doesn't
the cliff lead into a tunnel?
hmm... true.

cave.c

  You're doing something that I have a bad habit of doing sometimes,
which is giving geology lessons when I should be describing the room.
This isn't Mammoth Cave and you're not a tour guide.  You might want
to avoid doing this for future areas.
  Do you really mean the HEAD of the cavern, or the MOUTH?
but... but...  I LIKE describing!  It's FUN to use neat words to 
describe things...

cavern1.c

  Scrapped refers to scrapping.  How about scraped?  Scratched?  
aaah... fixed w/ scraped
  In the description for "rock", "lies" instead of "lays".
fixed
  In the description for "ceiling", you have a misplaced "a".
removed

cavern2.c

  THE smooth stone.
added
  In "junction", "separate".
fixed

cavern3.c

  The long description refers to a dome to the east, but the domed
room is to the west.  Shouldn't the ceiling be lower rather than 
shorter?
fixed, thanks btw.
  These smartass item descriptions sound like something I'd write...
On the other hand, nobody will probably read them, so that's okay.
VERY VERY small rocks! 


cavern4.c

  The third sentence doesn't make much sense.
true... seemed neat when I did it... I just removed it.
  For "path", rephrase.  That isn't grammatical.
tried to fix...
  For "paths", "chunch".
fixed
  For "sides", "The walls slide together into one wall that is being 
chipped away at"
changed
  For "tunnel", Talking like Yoda, this sentence does.
not as interesting... but straight forward

cavern5.c

  Item descriptions don't necessarily have to have a subject, but for
longer ones, you probably should.  The "tunnel" description should
probably be changed to: The tunnel branches out here and there, with
broken stones and rock chipped to gain access to the underground.
subjected
  Oh, and you misspelled "chipped".
  In ceiling, "although".
both fixed

cavern6.c

  AN intricate...
  The semi-colon is extraneous.
  For "picture", you have an extra \n in the first line.
all fixed

tunnel1.c

  Change the fourth sentence to, "There don't seem to be any cracks
of any sort along the passage."  
changed

tunnel2.c

  Do the four stone slabs center onto or around the door?
around
  For "slabs", and A meter thick...
ment it that way actually... but grammer I suppose...

tunnel3.c

  Had a problem with this room loading, minor typo in gir.c.  I fixed
it.
ok...
  Is the rock really wet, or is it shiny?
shiny
  Change "a room" to "the room".
changed
  For "cube" and "room", "dimensions".
  For "slabs", "A meter..."
all 3 changeed

Monsters
--------

snake1.c

  "The snake[subject] is only a meter IN length..."
  It's -> Its
done

snake2.c

  It's -> Its
  "to opposite" -> "the opposite"
done

snake3.c

  There's no subject in the second sentence.
  "at it's" -> "in its"
  "is seems" -> "it seems"
done

drand.c

  "...the entirety of his body, the only bald spot being..."
  Missing period at the end of the barter chat.
done

derz.c

  the -> they
  The attacking chats that you have for him seem better suited to
ordinary chats.  Same problem in the previous monster.
set_chat_chance != set_a_chat_chance
      load_chat != load_a_chat
fixed in all.  I didn't know the WAS attack/non attack

neiz.c

  Same problem.
same fix.

hidz.c

  spin -> spun
  Same problem as above.  You should go through all of your
monsters and check on this.
Fixed... only here

sheeh.c

  "...of the Tribe of Sithos, her womanly form..."
fixed

par.c

  Outstaged is one word.
  "...by a wide scar..."
fixed

wahz.c

  "an assassin"
fixed

irz.c

  "an assassin"
fixed

gir.c

  "Hir scaly feet and arms ARE constantly prepped..."
  His head has been plucked from their sockets?  Huh?
that's just plain wacky... can't believe I missed that.
fixed

skir.c

  "...an attack upon her..."
  Impressing -> Impressive
fixed

sithos.c

  The fangs are "flicked out"?  Or are they extended?
  The spell isn't frequent enough.  Jack it up to 25.
fixed...

------
to do later

monster:

denaiz.c

  As the first member of the Sithos tribe that the players will
encounter, perhaps you should describe his snakish attributes better?
Fiiiixed


trasz.c

  Ac1 is really wimpy for a body armor, especially one that is supposed
to be plate mail.  I suggest you make it scale mail, ring mail, or
something like that, and make it ac3, with a higher weight.
-
changed weight and ac to 3
changed it to be leather.


aaaaand I'm spent.
