tsuwabuki.c (19)
  Why would a young boy be level 19?

mari.c (19)
  Why would a young girl be level 19?

anthy.c (1)  **done**
  Her whole description is too wide.
  'Anthy looks AT you and smiles.'

mikage.c (20) ***done***
  HE is highly REGARDED
  Regarding the spell attack, why does he repeatedly grab new sabers?
  500 coins short?

mamiya.c (19)  ***done***
  The last sentence seems a little awkward.  You might want to think
    of a new way of phrasing it.  He is conspiring with Mikage to replace
    The Rose Bride himself?  What is the rose bride anyway?
  Averages 250 coins short?

utena.c (20)  ***done***
  My screen is linewrapping on her description.
  I don't know about the theme, but is she really level 20 dangerous?
    She doesn't sound very ferocious in her descrip, but this is anime
    so god knows...

saionji.c (20)   **done, because he wears it in the desc***
  Nothing about his jacket indicates why it would be worth ac3.  Make it
    ac2.  And why is it only cloned after his death?

juri.c (20) ***done***
  ...blond THAT fall just...
  brining -> bringing
  You might want to put a period at the end of her spell.

shiori.c (19) **done***
  ...A student at...
  Why is Shiori cloned again when the room is searched?  Was that
    intentional?  If so, a little more explanation is required.

a-ko.c (20)  ***done***
  An unseen hand smacks her foe across the back of your head?

b-ko.c (20)

c-ko.c (20) **done***
  ...a small kit falls IN the shadows.

nanami.c (20)  ***done****
  daintly -> daintily
  ...her her foe's side.
  Don't forget punctuation on her spell attack.

keiko.c  ***done***
aiko.c
yuuko.c (20)
  Punctuate their spell emotes.

kozue.c (19)  ***done****
  ...blue hair IS cut AS short...
  Her spell attack is to flash the player?  Heh...

miki.c (20)

akio.c (20) ***done***
  Description is too wide.
  ...A roguish look...
  pull -> pulled
  oldER brother
  
Items
-----
purse.c   ***done***
  You don't have a set_coins function in this item, so the cash obtained
    from purses is always 3000+random(3200).

?_ring.c   ***because the way they break***
  These all look exactly alike.  Why are they different files?

The katanas all need to weigh at least 3.   ***done***
