Rooms
-----

connection.c  **fixed**
  Indentation?
  Change the item description of foliege to foliage.
  In "path" description, leading TO the north.
  You have an extra period for the "path" description.

grass.c  *corrected*
  The width of the sign is a little long.  It wraps on my screen.

tree.c  *removed 4th sentance***
  The last sentence is not complete.  You have the subject, but no
    action.  Also, in general you shouldn't refer to the monsters
    in the room in your long descriptions because they might be
    dead soon.

court.c **done***
  In the "atrium" item description, attrium.
  In the "paths" description, the second sentence is a little confusing
    regarding where the east-west path leads.
  In general, you might want to make it clearer where the exits lead.
  Why is the passage south blocked?

garden.c  *changed*
  Roses of many kind -> Many kinds of roses

kendo.c **of***
  Practitioners IN the art, or practitioners OF the art?

fence.c  ***changed desc for crowds.  stupid auto periods***
  "The bottom floor is DONE covered in tatami mats."  If I were really
    a native West Virginian, that might've slipped past me.
  In the long description you say the room is bare except for a couple
    of fencers, but in the search command you refer to a crowd.
  You have extra periods in several item descriptions.

cafe.c  ***done***
  In the listen description: murmer -> murmur
  In the smell description: exquisit -> exquisite
  In the windows description, that should be two sentences.

  The piano VACATES the room?  Occupies?
