Southwest Forest

At the southeastern tip of the SouthWest Forest of Nirvana
there is a book.  It shows no title, and gives you directions
to open it.  You open it, and now it gives you directions to
reading it.  Pretty simple.

You read it, and it gives you the index.
something like:


page one . . . .  Sithos' Forest

Read on to explore.

Something like that... but w/ cute stuff.

Sithos' Forest is actually a cave
