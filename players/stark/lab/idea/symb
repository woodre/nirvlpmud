   Tall buildings rise high above you.  Revolving doors shuffle people in and out of these structures of glass and concrete.  Cars rush quickly past on the asphalt roadway.  The sidewalk you currently stand upon is also occupied by a small village of people trying to get one way or another.

   You stand at edge of the roof on a tall building.  The lights and movement of the city lay beneith you.  The dark night sky is all stands higher.  A shack with a small door is situated just north of you.  The roof is covered in tar and air vents.

   You are in a cramped dark cavern.  There is an opening to the east.  There is a slick black liquid that covers and coats the entire cave.  The black matter seems to pulse like a beating heart.  The liquid drips down slowly to the floor.
