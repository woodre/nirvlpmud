Personally I can't stand logging on to Nirvana when itslagged to hell to check my mail.....   So, I'm waiting to hear your ideas/comments-Blue**I'm not sure about anyone else, but I love the castle/quest that I havemade.  I put a lot of time into the theme and the coding.  There is no wayI'm going to pull it :)  However I do have some ideas:	1. I think we should all have our castles linked together somehow.Even if the themes are totally different, it gives variaty to theplayers.  I like this idea a lot.	2. I would be very willing to give up time to do a project that wecould all take part in if we wanted to.  We would need some ideas though!My brain is fried right now but if I think of anything I'll post it here.	3. I like the wiz group board idea blue :)I'm just a mess right now, I'll post more after I get some sleep.Dragnar/John**I was thinking about it....we could probably make a new area.  I mean, youcould have your separate castles and we could have a group area.  That way,no one would have to conform there castle to a theme.  We could make a hugearea with a consistant theme, and have our own castles.  You like?-Blue**Sure... I'd contribute to a common domain (like the kind in Genocide)but when you've already got a castle that's based on what happens when youstick your head in a tub of orange jello and get a mild hallucinationfrom it... Don't expect anything 'normal' from me *grin*Just a pile of nutso ideas...MizP.S. My castle is done, Blue... but it's kind of big. Everything sits in    /players/mizan/etheriel/.. id(str) { return str == "Mizan" || str == "ttijger1@vaxb.hofstra.edu"; }**I was just wondering if you picked your assistants yet?-Drag/John**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
