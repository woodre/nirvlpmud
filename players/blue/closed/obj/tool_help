The LPC tool is a very flexible object to make a wizards life a little
easier.  The two current functions are 'lpc' and 'path'.
  -'lpc'-
   The 'lpc' function is a convenient way to see if a function exists, or to
do simple patching/debugging.  Whatever argumant you give to 'lpc' will be
executed as written. A value will be printed, relating to whatever value the
function returned.
   For example-
   'lpc find_player("blue")->query_level();' would print my level.
   'lpc tell_object(find_player("boltar"), "This is an echo from Blue.\n");'
      would probably get me in trouble.
   'lpc write("This is a test.\n");' would print "This is a test." twice.
        ( once when it executed the write(), and again because write() returns
        the messgage its given.)
   'lpc write(present("tool", this_player())->query_auto_load()+"\n");
      would print the auto_load string of your tool.
   For convenience, I've made many macros that could make it easier to do all
this.  Type 'help macros' to see them.
   The 'path' commands make it easier to change directories.  The commands are
relatively straightforward.
   'setpath (<num>) <full path name> <alias>' sets up an alias for a path.
         <num> is optional.
   'showpaths'  shows all current path aliases.
   'path (<alias>)' tries to match <alias> to a path.  If successful, it puts
       you in that directory.  'path' with no alias puts you in your home dir.
   'tool <name>' gives someone a tool.
