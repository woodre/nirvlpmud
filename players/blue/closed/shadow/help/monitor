MONITOR

usage: 'shp <number or "attack" or 0>'
The shadow monitor is a very flexible tool.  It will give you basic information 
about your characters status, and if you are fighting will give you some
idea of how much damage your opponent has sustained.

The command for setting the moniters timing is 'shp'.  Typing 'shp 1' will
make the monitor go off frequently, while 'shp 10' would make it go only
every once in a while.  Typing 'shp attack' will make it only go off while 
you are fighting.  'shp 0' or just 'shp' will turn it off.

Typing 'mon' will show you your monitor but not turn it on.
