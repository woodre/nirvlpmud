usage: fade <player>

This allows you to "teleport" to another shadow, or, at higher levels, any 
player.  Some rooms, particularly quest rooms, do not allow this, so you
will not be able to do this.  Abuse of this spell will not be tolerated, and
anyone that feels it was misused and that there character suffered because of
it should mud-mail Blue.
