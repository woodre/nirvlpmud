SERVANT

The servants in the shadow guild work a little differently then in most guilds.
First, you make an object called a pearl with the command 'pearl'.  This pearl
stays in your inventory as a weightless object, until you type 'change', where
upon it changes into your servant.  You can change the servant back again with
the same command.   This is in case you want your servant to not get attacked,
or to stop attacking someone else.
   The pearl will keep track of your servants hit points, and will be with your
inventory until the servant dies, even if you quit, or it reboots.

see 'info servants2' for a list of commands for your servant.
