COMMANDER POWERS

The commander functions have a '<>' before the commmands.  They should be used
very carefully, and the are all logged.

<>promote <shadow> <number>  :     Promotes a shadow ( negatives can be used,
                                        max of 12)
                                   If the number is '0', their xps will be
                                   reset to match there level.  Use this to fix
                                   a players xps.
<>mark <player>              :     Give a player a shadow mark.  Check first
                                        to make sure the player shows up as not
                                        being in a guild on the 'ow'
<>remove <shadow>            :     Takes away a shadows mark.   For now, this
                                        is kinda pointless becuase it doesn't
                                        erase their guild variables.
ct <mesage>                        Tell a message over the commander channel
ce <emote>                         Do an emote over the commander channel.
