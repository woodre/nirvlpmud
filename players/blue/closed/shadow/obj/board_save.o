tmp_text "Hey, whoever's in charge.  One main idea would be to fix the shadow points.They never reach full, and take forever to recharge using transfer.Sometimes they are a negative number....A great idea would be to impliment some shadow emotes!  Like wisp out of roomor become dimmer or something neet looking like that.  Something thatdirectly shows what we are.A few neet abilities other than ones I mentioned before would be a shadowteleport spell, and a blend into shadows one....I hope this can help get the ball rolling again....Jarnor,The Shadow avenger**Another good 'spell' would be something along the lines of the Monk'sability to see if their opponent's armor class is higher or lower thantheir own.  Perhaps we can call it 'compare' or something.**How about a really high level attack: shifting into shadow form, we have a chance to sneak up on our opponent and deliver a very viscious blow! The chances of success would have to be slim, depending on level...but still, it might be a neat attack!**I thought that would be a good idea, or have us attack the opponent'sshadow with a spell, either causing damage or a lowered chance of theopponent hitting us, as we are kinda hard to see like that...Any other ideas?  WHo's in charge here anyways??**I am glad we are getting things done.  I am sick of people saying shadesdon't do anything.  I think we should get an invis spell at certain level.possibly to balance, we could get rid of some spells that don't have muchto do with being a shade, like chain fire, even if they ARE cool.death is good for us tho.  Emotes would be very nice.Jarnor**if this is about testing, I heard somebody call me dummy**The emote ideas are good ones. In general, super-attacks will not beapproved by the powers that be here. Comparing guilds to one another, especiallyshadows to monks, paladins, bards, etc. is not relevant. If you are goingto uggest ideas that other guilds have, convert them to shadow abilities...ex. perhaps a spell that allows shadows to judge the relative strength of anopponent's life force...The new guild object is coming and it will be very nice so stick around.Snow**At this time it appears the only way to advance is through Pathfinder, do not use the orb in this guild... it will _not_ work.  please take note of this...****Cannot get to new guild using "guild" spell or by typing newguild here...shadow spell idea- how about FEAR spell thatchanges alignment of creature towards "good", maybe decreases AC, combat efficiency...      mrmessy**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
