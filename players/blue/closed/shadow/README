SHADOW GUILD

Files:

The path to almost all the files is /players/blue/closed/shadow
That directory contains:
   shadow.c - The main file.  Defines variables, calls reset, directs compiler,
              contains init() and auto_load functions.
   spells.h - Contains all spells that depend on level.
   utilities.h - Contains non-init() functions, like queries and level checks.
   standard.h - Contains init() functions like guild talk, hp monitor, etc.
   commander.h - Contains promote/revoke, and other commander functions.
   define.h - Contains #define s.
   help.h - Directs help functions.

also, /players/blue/closed/lib/color.h contains ansii color stuff ( not yet
           really used.

Every file and subdirectory in /players/blue/closed/shadow is used in the guild
somewhere.

Here is an overview of how some of the things work:

Shadow points:  Each player has 10*guild level shadow points.  The shadow
    points (shp) can be used on any guild spell, or transfered to spell 
    points.  The transfer ratio centers around 1/2, worse for newbies,
    better for higher level guild members. 
      The player selects whether shadow points or spell points are drained 
   for spells.

Servants:   The servant is not disposable.  Its hit points are remembered.
   The character can dismiss his servant ( if he/she/it doesn't want it 
   attacked ) or call it back.  If the player doesn't have a servant, a new
   one can be created.  The servant has 300hp.  The creation cost 200 points,
   and calling/dismissing an already created servant costs 30 points.  The 
   servant can carry things.  If dismissed, the servant is moved to 
   /players/blue/closed/shadow/rooms/servant_store, holding onto its items.
   The player can quit, and come back and recall the same servant.  The items
   are lost at the reboot.
   As of yet, the servants cannot attack.
   Players can heal their servant at a 3/4 heal to spell point ratio.

Attack spells:  Drain is for all levels, with a variable damage up to 5 times
   guild level.   Cost is the same.
   Death is for 12th level only.  It does 85 points of damage, costs 70 sp and
      15 hp ( the player who casts this spell at 13 hit points will die.)
   Chain is an area attack spell.  The damage is 5 * guild level, and the 
      cost varies between 3-5 times guild level.  The more monsters, the less
      it costs.  The justification for the lower cost is that the player can't 
      control the the damage (a lot of spell points could be wasted), and that
      all the monsters in the room will begin to attack.
   
Advance costs are in /players/blue/closed/shadow/obj/black_orb.c.  There is 
   no xp swapping.  The player simply advances when the go to the orb and type
   advance with enough free experience.  

The 'info <topic>' command gives help on <topic>. 'info help' gives a list of
topics.   You may find this useful.

Also, for some reason some wizzes have had problems getting this object to 
work for them.  It may be file persmission stuff.  It works fine for players.
