This is the castle of Blue.

Down are many monsters for very new characters to hack at. 
Up are many monsters for low level characters to hack at.
Beyond the gate are hard monsters to hack at high level players.

If you run into any problems, use the bug<whatever the bug is> command, or mail
me.  Also, especially with the harder monsters, its not easy to tell whats too
easy or too hard.  If you think something is ridiculously hard and not worth 
the treasure, mail me about it.
