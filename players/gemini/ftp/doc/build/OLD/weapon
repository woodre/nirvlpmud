Weapon Rules
------------
Weapons should NEVER be above WC 20 without the permission of a God.

Standard weapons should generally be below WC 16.

'Special' extra-valuable weapons should generally be between WC 16
and WC 20.

Weapons with special attributes must be okayed with a God, with the
exception of weapons that do extra damage to certain monsters. These
kind of weapons should be at most WC 35 for that monster.

Special weapons with extra powers should have a WC of around 15 to
compensate for the extra powers.

A table of standard weapons, their WC's, values, and weights, will
be available shortly in an effort to halt the proliferation of
weapons that have similar names but completely different attributes.

In the future we may require that special weapons be unique, so that
only one can exist in the game at a time. More on this will be said
later.

***Important Note***
Weapons above WC 15 should be extremely difficult to get.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a generic weapon avaliable. To set up do :
	object wobj;

	wobj = clone_object("obj/weapon");

For customization the following routines are available :

You should call these functions:
set_name(n) 
    string n. Sets the name and short description to n.
    Sets long description to "You see nothing special.\n"

set_class(c) 
    int c. Sets how much damaged it will do.

set_weight(w) 
    int w. Sets the weight.

set_value(v) 
    int v. Sets the value.

These are the optional functions:
set_alt_name(n) 
    string n. Adds an alternate name to weapon.

set_alias(n) 
    string n. Adds another alternate name to weapon.

set_short(sh) 
    string sh. Short description is set to sh. Long to short + "\n"

set_long(long) 
    string long. Long description is set to long.

set_read(str) 
    string str. str will be returned if it's read.

set_hit_func(ob) 
    object ob. Sets up a call to function 'weapon_hit' in object 'ob'.
    'weapon_hit' is called every time the weapon strikes someone.
    The argument given to 'weapon_hit' is the target of the attack.
    The return value of 'weapon_hit' adds to the weapons wc for this hit.

set_wield_func(ob)
    object ob. Sets up a call to function 'wield' in object 'ob'.
    'wield' is called every time the weapon is wielded.
    A return value of 0 form 'wield' means that the weapon will not 
    be wielded. 1 that it's okay to wield it.

EXAMPLE
	/*
	 * This is a magic sword is has a wc of 9 as base
	 * and a wc of 19 if it's attacking an orc.
	 */
	orc_slayer = clone_object("obj/weapon");
	call_other(orc_slayer, "set_name", "short sword");
	call_other(orc_slayer, "set_alias", "sword");
	call_other(orc_slayer, "set_short", "Short sword");
	call_other(orc_slayer, "set_alt_name", "orc slayer");
	call_other(orc_slayer, "set_long", "This is a very fine blade.\n"+
		"It's covered with ancient runes.\n" + 
		"Engraved on it is a picture of the sword slicing an orc.\n");
	call_other(orc_slayer, "set_read", 
		"The only thing you can read is the word 'orc'.\n");
	call_other(orc_slayer, "set_class", 9);
	call_other(orc_slayer, "set_weight", 2);
	call_other(orc_slayer, "set_value", 200);
	call_other(orc_slayer, "set_hit_func", this_object());
	.
	.
	.

weapon_hit(attacker)
{
    if(call_other(attacker,"id","orc")){
	write("Ziiing\n");
	return 10;
    }
    return 0;
}
