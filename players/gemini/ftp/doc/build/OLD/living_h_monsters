  
   I have put in a system to stop players from fighting and hitting more than
     one monster at a time, similiar to that used by shadowhawk on 5150.
     If you have a monster that just uses living.h or living.c (like the 
     go player /obj/go_player.c) you will have to add this line in your
     heart_beat() if you have one.
     already_fight=0;
     if you dont your monster will be unable to fight back.
