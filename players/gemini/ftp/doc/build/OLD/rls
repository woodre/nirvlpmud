                    WIZARD BUILDING RULES
                    ---------------------

Healing Guidelines
------------------
Healing that doesn't involve intoxicating the player should cost
approximately 60 coins per hp+spellpt healed.
Healing that intoxicates the player normally (as per the pub) should
cost approximately 20 coins per hp+spellpt healed.
Healing that intoxicates the player much more than 'usual' (as per the pub)
should cost approximately 10 coins per hp+spellpt healed.
Healing that SEVERELY intoxicates the player may cost less than
10 coins per hp+spellpt healed.
Healing that does not renew spellpts may cost less.
These guidelines are flexible, but anyone straying too far from them had
better ask one of the Gods for permission, or else they will be in trouble.
------------------------
SEE /doc/build/armor AND /doc/build/weapon FOR ARMOR AND WEAPON GUIDELINES.
------------------------
Do not make monsters too easy relative to the amount of treasure they give,
or make monsters worth too much experience! Anyone doing this will be
in trouble, unless one of the Gods has okayed it. If you are unsure
whether a monster/treasure is okay, ask a God.
------------------------
Wizards allowing special "wizard items" to fall into the hands of players
will be in serious trouble. Therefore, all wizard items should have
security features built in to prevent players from using them.
Wizard features should only be accessable to players of level *21* or
greater, to prevent unsponsored apprentice wizards from doing stupid things.
------------------------
And please, check your castles for exits that dump players into the void,
incorrect exits, spelling/grammar errors, and items that do not have long()
descriptions.
------------------------
-- Do not make 'deadly' traps. A player must never die because he didn't
   know what happens in the next room. If some room is very dangerous,
   make some hint (like the giant footprints beside the giant lair).

-- Never initialize the destination of an object outside your castle. If you
   make a monster that can walk out of the castle, be sure that it is a
   very nice monster.

-- Never generate messages that looks like something it isn't (good and precise
   rule :-). That is, don't try to fool the player that someone says something
   when it isn't true etc.
