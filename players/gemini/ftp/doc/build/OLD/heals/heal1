           6 -                              20
-If heal = 1 and Intox Strength is 3 or greater then cost may be 10.
-If heal > 50 then cost must be 10,000. NO EXCEPTIONS!
 otherwise follow the chart above.

Non-Intox Items:

-ALL non-intox items will cost 60 coins / pt. healed
-Any item that heals more than 50 must cost 10,000.

Sobering Items:

-All sobering items will cost 20 for the first -1 or -2 strength.
 each following -1 will cost 20 more coins.

-Anything that sobers more than -15 will cost 10,000.

Food Items:

-All food items will follow the Intox Items rules if they have stuffing 
 strength accounted for.
-If the item does not cause stuffing, then they are treated as non-intox item.
-Any item healing more than 50 must cost 10,000

Remote Ordering of Healing Items:

-There will be no healing items sold by remote ordering items.
 this means that the player can not order healing while on compaign

Portable healing:

-  Anything in a container must have included the value
   of the empty container when sold.
-  All healing objects with charges must not save in
   hotels,lockers,houses,etc.
-  The cost of a item with charges will cost players based on following:
   cost=#ofcharges*(cost_per_charge)
   NOTE: Intox multi-charge heals are to follow the table in heal3.
         If an existing heal following the traditional table is of equal or
         higher cost than table heal3, then modification is not required.
         Soak and Stuff healing to be similar
-  The items will have a minimum weight, weight=#charges/3
-  ALL items must have a weight of at least one, and the carry of the 
   player MUST be checked at purchase.
-  Any multiple charge healing item will heal NO MORE than 175 TOTAL. the
   total being the sum of the all HEALING for ALL charges. random points 
   will be counted as 2/3 of a point.  so something with 4 charges 
   of 3+random(6) healing will have a total healing of 4*3 + 4*6*(2/3) = 28
   anything more and its a full 10K heal.

   Sobering items, cost=#ofcharges*(cost_per_charge) until the total 
   sobering reaches 30, at which it must be above 10000.
   sobering items will have a weight equal to the number of charges.

Healing Over Time
  Healing over time will cost the same as it would if it were done all at once
  with a small discount of 1 coin for every point healed.

Spell points for healing....
  This practice is just plain stupid. it is not allowed. you may change sp 
  to hp or hp to sp with some random loss. 

All items using stuffing or intoxication must check that the player has reached
not yet reached its max, see drink_alcohol() in player.c
 
NEW-> FAILURE TO Conform to these rules will be subject to one warning.
after which demotion is 2 levels per offending object found.

Heal Spells
 
Guild healing spells should cost as above plus a suitible number of 
spell points.
 
Heal Failure

The heal failing for damage to the player can be used for a cost reduction.
That cost reduction is based on the failure rate. The formula for this
as is follows:
       cost savings % = failure rate % - (failure rate %)/5
example:
       cost savings % = 25% - 25%/5 = 20%
 
High damage done can make the ratio one to one. 1% failure per 1% savings.
High damage is where the amount of hit points that the heal would restore
is equal to or less than the damage done upon failure. If it is a heal
spell the spell points must still be spent, any other heal must be used
up, either the whole heal or charge as the case may be.
Minimum damage must be as follows: 
money cost * savings rate = saved 
saved * heal/money = points
points * 2 * 1.5 = minimum damage    NOTE: *2 is for sp & hp
for examaple:
1200 coin cost * 10% savings = 120 coins saved.
120 * 1pt/60coins = 2
2 * 2 * 1.5 = 6
so for this the minimum damage is 6.

savings rate is not to exceed 25%.
