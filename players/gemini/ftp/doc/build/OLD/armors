Armor:

Armor is the player's best friend in the game. Therefore it behoves us to make 
it scarce (good armor that is). Here are some basic armor rules that should be
followed.

1. Armor must be one of the following types: armor, helmet, shield, ring, 
   amulet, boot, and misc. No other types will be allowed.

2. The maximum ac for type armor is 5, All other types should be ac 1. ANY 
   deviation from this MUST be approved by an arch wizard or above.

3. Good armor should be scarce. Don't put it on every monster.
