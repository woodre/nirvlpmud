Armor Rules:
------------
Armor should NEVER be above AC 5 without the permission of a God.
New 'type's (see set_type() below) of armor may only be created with the
permission of a God.
The standard armor types are: armor, helmet, shield, ring, amulet, boot,
                              glove, cloak.
Armor with type other than "armor" should rarely be above AC 1, and
never above AC 2 without the permission of a God.

A table of standard armors, their AC's, values, and weights will be
be available soon in an effort to halt the proliferation of armor pieces
that have similar names but completely different attributes.

***Important Note***
Armor makes life easy for the players, so it should be difficult to get.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get an armor do:
    object aobj;

    aobj = clone_object("obj/armor");

For customization the following routines are available :

You must call these functions:

set_name(n) 
    string n. Sets the name and short description to n.
    Sets long description to short + ".\n"

These are the optional functions:

set_short(s) 
    string s. Sets the short description to s and the long to short + ".\n"

set_long(l)
    string l. Sets the long description to l.

set_value(v) 
    int v. Sets the selling value to v.

set_weight(w) 
    int w. Sets the weight to w.

set_ac(a) { ac = a; }
    int a. Sets the armor class to a. A random value up to 'a' is subtracted
    from the hit.

set_alias(a) { alias = a; }
    string a. Sets an alias name if armor.

set_type(t) { type = t };
    string t. Sets the type of armor to t. Only one of every type can be worn.
    These are the types you can use: helmet, amulet, armor, shield, ring, 
    glove, cloak and boot. 
    Default is armor. The armor class of every worn armor is added
    together.

set_arm_light(l) 
    int l. Makes the armor shine like a lamp of strength l.
