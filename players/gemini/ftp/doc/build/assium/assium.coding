Coding on reflex's mud of shame: 


While I think a outright policy of forbiding people from reflex's 
world of shame would be something that goes against my basic ideas,
but keep in mind that mud is not the same as any other mud. 

If reflex had started his own mud, from base sources, without trying
to ruin my good name and steal the player base from this one, there 
would be no problems. However reflex decided to steal this mud's 
code and slander me. He also sought fit to spam the mud's mail 
system and cause a great deal damage from that action but also geting
a number of wizards to leave at the same time. These are simply 
unacceptable actions.

Because reflex world uses my custom code, despite being under a 
few layers of paint, (yes, I can see it in basic logic of operation, 
not to mention the numerous spots they missed where my phrasing and
language comes up again and again) I cannot really trust any wizard who 
decides he wants to code there. By doing so, and I am being honest, 
I will begin to think that such a person poses a risk to nirvana,
A point for reflex to pick up on what we are doing, steal more 
modern code, fix bugs in the 1994 code that he has, and basically 
continue to feed that mud. A mud that doesn't want to stand on it's 
own feet, but suck the life force out of this one. 

I won't de-wiz someone unless I find out they have done something 
wrong such as transfer code. However, I won't have the same trust 
of such a person that I would of someone who turns reflex down 
cold.  I am simply being honest, here. It's not a threat, it's my
honest feelings regarding the matter. I think that most people 
reading this would feel the same way in my place.
