If you, as a wizard find it necesscary to kick a member out of your
guild, wack them, or in anyway do something that harms a player
YOU MUST send mail to boltar stating why and showing that it is 
a suitible punishiment. The best way to show that is to point
me to a file that players were supposed to read stating they agreed 
to certain rules and punishments. 
In absence of such things I will likely make my own judgement.
You may not like that. This has been a problem more than
once so the doc has been written.
