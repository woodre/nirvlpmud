 Since there are backup player files, they can have their player
file restored. if the information was retained in a guild file, one 
can ask for a backup, though I maynot be able to find one. 

I think the guild wiz should set a guild restoration policy for that
guild. whatever he feels is correct. generally however
people's guild status will get restored with their pfile.
