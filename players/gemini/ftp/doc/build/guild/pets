  Upon noticing that guild pets are out of hand I have decided upon the 
following.

            1:    A pet will not have more than 130 hp
                  175 hp if is_pet() returns 1
            2:    A pet will not have an AC greater than 4
                   ac 5 if is_pet() returns 1
            3:    A pet will not have a WC greater than 12
                  wc of 15 if is_pet() returns 1
            4:    No more than 1 pet at a time. (No more zoo parades
                  walking after players)
            5:  pets must cost a player more than a few spell points
                these things must have some drawbacks as of now they
                are like free-bees
            6:  pets should have a level normal for their experience
                and should be no more than level 8 or so for a 130hp
                pet
            7:  Pets must not be able to attack players. 
                They may turn on their owners, but cannot be used in pk.
             8:  All experience earned by the pet, is to be retained
                 by the pet. No experience is to be passed to a player.

   Now you all are going to say the mudkids are more powerful, but you
forget that guild pets start strong. A mudkid must be raised to be of
any value at all. they start with 30 hp AC=0, and WC=hands(3). the 
player must divert his experience to raise them up, and spend money
to heal, and equip them. Mudkids are worthless without player investment.

If you wish to make one stronger have me (boltar) aprove it. however it must
cost a player something more than the standard few coins or spell pts.

Pets must NOT be avialible on the go. You have two choices, one all
pets sold from a fixed location, or two, Only one pet per person per reboot. 
Pets should have a significant cost associated with them, if they are to
be of any real value.

APPENDIX

All pet-types that are made, must have a check for query_ghost()
so that players may not command them when ghosted.
[Preferably, the pets will die or disappear when the player
dies.]
