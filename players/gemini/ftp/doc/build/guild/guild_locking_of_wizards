Guild lock outs of wizards has become an issue again. This time I have
decided to write an offical ever lasting document on the topic. 

1) It will now be considered wrong for a wizard to retain guild objects
   or membership to a guild he was not in at the time of becoming 
   wizard or invited to by the guild wizard. 

2) All guilds should be *EASILY* accessible to senior wizards level 100
   and higher. This means that the guild object should be clonable by 
   seniors for *TEMPORARY* use. Such wizards may be denied the use of 
   guild channels and such. If there is *compelling* reason for a 
   senior not to be able to clone the guild object, then it should 
   present a message with how to gain access, easily.  

Conditions can be easily code enforced with a query_autoload that doesn't
set for those not allowed, etc etc. I expect guild wizards to be able 
to modify their own code. If a test character is required, then the guild
wizard should make it an extremely simple process that is well defined 
so it takes someone no more than a few seconds to follow it. 
examples of a compelling reason to force a test character are:
 1) guild members must be joined by a proper method or the code is 
    non-functional, breaks function for players, or other such dependencies.
 2) corruption of guild save files, guild data, etc.

Examples of non-compelling reasons that should be delt with by code: 

   1) wizards are a disturbing influence. 
   2) wizards will just clone the object and keep it everyday. (illegal 
      via this document, btw) 
   3) wizards will spy on what guild members are saying. (they can anyway)

Responsible use:

Wizards are only to clone other guild objects for investigational purposes
only. Not to hang out, not sit there. Just to do any approval, balance, 
judgements, etc as required by their rank and duties.
