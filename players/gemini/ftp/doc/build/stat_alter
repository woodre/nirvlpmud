Altering Monster Stats in combat
 
Weapon class 

Weapon class should never be lowered below three quarters the orginal weapon
class ( org_wc * 3 / 4 ) or by seven ( org_wc - 7 ) which ever results
in the HIGHER weapon class.  It is up to the wizard if the limit is 
to be reached in one step or in many, however in any case this limit
must be used as the absolute low. There may be less of an effect than the
limits allow but NEVER more. 
When the player leaves, or switches to another monster there MUST be 
a correction that resets the monster BACK to its ORIGINAL stats. If 
the monster lives it will recover.
This may also be done on a timed basis as well so long as the duration
AFTER the player has moved his focus away is SMALL.
 
Armor Class

Same rules as for weapon class apply. Limits are org_ac * 2 / 3  or 
org_ac - 4 whichever results in the HIGHER armor class. 
Once agian monsters MUST be restored to ORIGINAL values.

max_hp

A Monster's max hit points is NOT to be altered. If there is compelling 
need approval from boltar might be possible for an exceptially clever
way of doing this while restoring the monster's previous state and limiting
the advantage given to players.

healing rate
 
The monster's healing rate may only be altered for SHORT periods of time.
Ideally it SHOULD NOT BE altered at all. Agian the healing rate MUST
be restored to its orginal state once the player changes focus or a 
prescribed time limit. ( A small one )
 
special consideration
 
Boltar will approve all things not in compliance with the above. Without
such approval the code may be made to fit the above by any 100+ wizard.
