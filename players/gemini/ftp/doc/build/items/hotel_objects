Now available set objects so they do not save in the hotel....
if you are using /obj/armor /obj/weapon or /obj/treasure
do the following:

         call_other(object, "set_save_flag", 0);

if the object is totally your own add the following function.

    query_save_flag() { return 1; }

If you have your own personal generic objects like armor and weapon
please add the following to prevent them from retoring as a 0

          generic_object() {return 1;}
     if armor,weapon,or treasure is NOT inherited or included by your
     generic object you must copy the save_thing and restore_thing
     functions into your generic object.
