  A healing item would be any item that increases or improves the recover rate
of either hit points(hps) or spell points(sps).  These items should be very rare
and only found on NPCs that are impossible to kill except by the most experienced
players.  In other words, players should not be able to equip with a full set of
healing armor and weapon that will almost guarantee that they will not take any
damage in fights.  If you feel the need to code one of these items, the following
rules must be strictly adhered to:

  *No healing item or weapon is to be storable.
  *Healing armors except body armor cannot exceed an armor class of 1.
  *Body armors that heal cannot exceed an armor class of 3.
  *Weapons that heal cannot exceed a weapon class of 18 including returns.
  *Any healing item must be worn or wielded to function, not just in inventory.
  *The healing rate must be variable and not exceed the formula '1+random(5)'.
  *Healing total cannot exceed 5 and may be split between hps and sps.  A
    heal_self(3) would not be acceptable as it would be a total of 6.
  *Any healing item must have some kind of drawback. (ie. heavy weight,
     alignment restrictions, timer to dest it, etc)
  *The healing cannot happen more than 5% of the time.  (i.e. random(20))
