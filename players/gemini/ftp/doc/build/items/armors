Armor:

Armor is the player's best friend in the game. Therefore it behoves us to make 
it scarce (good armor that is). Here are some basic armor rules that should be
followed.

1. Armor must be one of the following types: armor, helmet, shield, ring, 
   amulet, boot, and misc. No other types will be allowed.

2. The maximum AC for type 'armor' is 5.  No AC5 armor is to store, however.

3. Good armor is not to be purchased.  For purchased armor:  type 'armor'
   should not exceed AC3 and all other types must not exceed AC1.  The cost
   should be:  type 'armor' - 500 coins per AC level, all other types - 250
   coins each min.  A player could then purchase a full set of armor with a
   total AC of 9 for a minimum of 3000 coins.

4. Any AC2 armor other than type 'armor' is to be rare.  It should come from
   a very difficult monster and be earned.  In even rarer cases, the AC2 armor
   could be saveable.  In this case, the AC2 armor should be approved by two
   senior wizards and their name and approval date noted in the item.  We are
   not trying to make it easy for any player to store a complete set of the
   best armor so use good judgement.  The exception to this might be an armor
   that 'transforms' and becomes higher AC than its original.  In this case,
   the item's change should be irreverseable so that the item will only store
   if it has NOT been transformed.

5. It is possible and even recommended that high AC armors have drawbacks to
   go along with their increased AC.  A constant hps/sps drain, loss of coins,
   heavy weight are just a few examples.

6.  No armor other than type 'armor' may exceed AC2.
