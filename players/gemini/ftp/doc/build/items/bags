Bags must have a limit to the weight that may be put into them.
If not a weight limit, an item limit. A single bag must 
not be able to carry more than 17 items or a weight greater
than what a 19 level player would be able to carry.
The formula is level + 6 + strength/5 so  29.

A limitless bag may be created if a player takes the 
weight charge at 1/8 of the total items in the bag.
The weight of all items in the bag is to be added
then divided by 8. this will be the weight charge
to the player.

External carry devices. These devices must not be secure.
In other words, another player should be able to steal
the objects. A living helper that can be killed etc. Such a critter
will be called a carry pet. It should be level 1 and have 5 hp
or less. Other wise it will fall under the pet rules.
Its carry limit should be the same as allowed for a level 1
in /obj/living and /obj/player. Non-living devices should
be similar.
