Specific properties within room.c have been added, because exit() and handling
of clearing fight area code and such is still not being handled properly
by wizards.

A property alone is handled by the game as one string, more than one property
is added to an array. You can still have non-fight rooms and non-magic rooms
at the same time, and this system makes it much easier.

Examples are in /open/examples/props/

VALID PROPERTIES:

       no_follow    no_teleport    no_magic
       no_fight     spar_area      fight_area

These should be self explanatory -- for clarification, contact a senior wizard.
