Beck: [4.21.02]

When doing damage to living objects (or whatever), please use the standard
damage functions which are hit_player() and do_damage().

Do not use add_hit_point(-x) to cause damage.
This does not properly calculate death.

If you wish to cause something unrestricted damage, just use a
hit_player() with a non-standard damage type of "other|[wizardname]".

Example: player->hit_player(x, "other|beck");

This will cause unrestricted damage (no armor class) but still
has all the proper checks involved.

Also, put a note as to why you are using unrestricted damage.
Please make these changes if you can.
I will modify the ones I come across.
