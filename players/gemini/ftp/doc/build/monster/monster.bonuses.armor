1]
  For monsters that wear armor their set_ac and the ac of the worn armor are
  now added together, therefore making the monster have a higher ac. 

  This total number is what you see now when you stat a monster.

  So, if you have a monster that the ac has become too high, 
  you will need to lower the set_ac amount in the monster file.

2]
  The worn armor is NOT currently taken into account
  for determining exp.
