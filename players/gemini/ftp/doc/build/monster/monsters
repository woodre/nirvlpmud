Monsters:

Monsters, more than any other thing, are your greatest tools to tell your story.
They are your main way to interact with players. Your monsters should be crafted
with your castle's theme in mind, because they are your main way to convey that
theme.
theme. Here are some rules for monster creating. 

1. Monsters should be UNIQUE
Preferably all monsters in your castle should be unique, original creations.
However I am most concerned with high level monsters. Those of lv 17 or greater.
ALL monsters of lv 17 or greater Must be unique. This means there will be no
rooms of multiple identical monsters of these levels. This also means that you
can't just rename the monsters and call that unique (i.e. god1, god2, god3).

2. Treasure on monsters should refelct the ROLE of the monster
Every monster you make does NOT have to carry the maximum amount of treasure
for its level. The treasure it carries should be determined by it's role in
your theme, and (heaven forbid) plain common sense. For example: Johny is 
making an evil vampire keep. Outside it is guarded by 2 vicious wolves. These
wolves might very well be high level, but a wolf would not carry 5000 coins,
a wc 18 blade, and elven boots!! Most likely you'd be lucky if he had a 100 coin
collar on. Remember, your theme dictates what role the monster plays, this in
turn will help you decide what the monster should carry. 

3. Use the monster guide numbers as a GUIDE. They are not hard numbers. 
Experiment with things. For instance, instead of making a monster 400hp, make
it random(150)+300, ect.

4. Make your monsters different
Players remember a monster if it is out of the ordinary. This make the game
more fun and interesting. Here are some ideas. Make them run away, steal items,
force you to unwield your weapon, chase the player, ect. You can also make your
monsters interactive. This is also a fun way to get players involved in your
theme. Not just quest monsters can be interactive.
