The note is titled 'practice/worthless monsters(boltar, Mar 30, 100000)':

 
 all practice monsters using the /obj/living.c 
must call set_no_exp_value();
just calling this function blocks any and all experience
to be gained by a player.
in other words the player recieves 0 exp from the practice monster.
this system MUST be added to all practice monsters or a similar one
to non standard monsters of this purpose. other wise they will be fixed
or removed by the senior wizard who finds them.
agian the player must not receive exp for practice/sparing/test/etc monsters
