Wizard Conduct:

I've always thought these rules were self evident; however, I'll spell them
out to avoid misunderstandings.

1. Wizards may neither help nor hinder players. Seems pretty simple, but I'm
   constantly amazed how often this one is broken. Let's make it even more 
   simple to understand. I don't care if you hate the person more than I hate
   Jane Fonda, you don't touch em, in any way. This includes unprovoked verbal
   harrasement. The same holds true for the opposite. I don't care if the
   player is your blood brother who saved your life in vietnam. You may not
   aid him in any way.

2. Do as your told. This one seems to piss people off the most, but it is 
   necessary to retain some order. We have archs for a reason. If a lv 100
   or above asks you to do something (i.e. change code, quit harrassing someone
   Then do it. You can always appeal to a god later. As far as what a god tells
   you. That's final, you do it, or you can find another mud to play. It is your
   choice.

3. Keep wizard matters strictly wizard matters. This is rather simple also.
   If a decision or policy is made that you disagree with, I do not appreciate
   a wizard who spreads his biased view to as many players as possible. This
   acomplishes nothing but grief. Players, like it or not, have very little say
   in what is decided by the administration. We don't get paid for this, so
   we do what WE like. If you have disagreements, feel free to argue them with
   other wizards, just keep players out of it.

4. I expect all wizards to be totally familiar with all rules in
   /doc/build/rules. Ignorance of these rules are not an excuse
