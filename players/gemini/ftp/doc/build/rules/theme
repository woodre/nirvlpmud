Castle Theme:

Nirvana, unlike some muds, allows you the creative freedom to create your own
castle theme. You do not have to follow a mudwide theme. However, it is strongly
recomended that you develope a theme for your area.  Your area should create
a mood. You are basically telling a story, that will hopefully encourage player
role playing. The theme of your castle also contributes to many other aspects
of your building. It will be refered to in further help files.
