Vertebraker [4.22.02]

You can query the amount of total damage done to a player in
the current heart_beat [via any of the methods: hit_player(),
heal_self(), or add_hit_point()] with the function:

ob->query_dam_taken_this_round();

Actually, it works on all living objects, not just
players.

Hey.. Zeus found use for it...
