I added a reply cmd to the game, if you wish for your private
tells and such to set the replyer of whoever you're sending a 
tell to, add

    ob->Replyer(x);

 where 'ob' is the player you are sending a tell to, and 
    'x' is your real_name.

If you're confused, check out tell(str) & Replyer(x) in player.c and
/bin/_reply.c

                                                        verte
