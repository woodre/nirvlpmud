Vampire Guild Seconds.....
  The issue of people having multiple vampire characters has once again sur-
faced.  Historically, there have been players who had multiple vampire char-
acters.  It worries me much more that players have seconds in other guilds
and might use their vampire character to spy on our guild than to have two
characters in this guild.  However, after talking to some of the older vamps
and using my powers of recall concerning this issue when previously discussed,
I feel a need to set down the rules under which I will continue to let this
practice exist:

	*No player shall have more than 2 vampire characters

	*All players with multiple vampire characters will mail me with
	  the names of their seconds within 24 hours of joining the
	  family with a new char.  It will be their responsibility to
	  keep me informed of their character's status.

	*Only one character of any given player may bite a new vampire
	  or vote on any issue.

  The reason for concern is that theoretically, a player could advance three
vampire characters to level 17 and then bite anyone they wanted into the
guild without any other vamps.  The same holds true of having multiple votes
on guild issues.  I believe this document addresses both of those concerns.

  I will not tolerate any player trying to use any excuses for inappropriate
vampire behavior (i.e. 'This is my bad vamp and I'm only seperating chars' or
anything like that).  If you break the rules or don't follow them and you're
found out, ALL your chars will be expelled.  I'm glad you enjoy the guild and
I want you to have fun but don't try to jerk me around.

  Lastly, those vampire characters currently here (i.e. seconds) will be
allowed to remain here unless they break our rules.
