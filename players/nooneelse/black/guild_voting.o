note "These are the added commands available to Vampire Guild Assistants andLieutenants.  Anyone found to be abusing them will be removed from theguild permanently (& if I happen to be on when I notice the offense,I'll probably zap them a few times too.)office      Takes you to your office so you can help a member or answer      questions for a player about the guild.      (Your offices are up from the upper guild hall.  Examine the      doors to see which is yours.)      The office doors are normally locked.  You can unlock them      from the inside.  You can enter your office even if it is locked.      There is a board for officer use only on the top floor.  Players      cannot read the notes, add notes or remove notes on this board.back      Takes you back to the room you did the 'office' command from.check <who>      Check to see if a player is on either the member list or the      list of former memberspunish <who>      Give a vampire a punishment mini-quest to solve (like the      guild tasks) if they've been bad but not bad enough to get      expelled from the guild.repair [<who> task/level <#>]      Fix a member's task level if it gets screwed up.      ('repair' alone will tell you which task is which level)replace <who>      Give a member a new set of fangs if theirs disappears somehow.      (Make sure to check this board 1st to be sure some other       lieutenant had removed them.)remove <who>      This is the highest form of punishment other than total removal      from the guild.      Make sure you place a note here so the other lts & I know what      is going on.      Do NOT replace someone's fangs just because you disagree with      the removing lts reasons. Mail me & I will decide if it was an      abuse of the power or not.summon <who>      Not a new command, but it does not cost guild officers the      50 spell points.(master & assistant only)(master & assistant only)reverse <who>      Give <who> their fangs & experience back.**the tasks are going to be changed also.i'm going to look into adding the code necessary to make the tasks ateach level random. also, the player will not be able to solvethe task until he/she/it has attained the level necessary to usethe spells in that task level.this means that to solve task 2, you will have to be level 4.to solve task 3, you will need to be level 7.to solve task 4, you will need to be level 12.to solve task 5, you will need to be level 15.to solve task 6, you will need to be level 17.**As the policy now stands, there will be no readmittance onceanyone leaves the family for any reason.  That keeps it simple.**It has come to my attention that some of you clowns that arehigh enough level to bite new vamps in are palming off yourresponsibilities for the tour onto lower level vamps. In somecases these lower levels vamps are almost too new to reallyknow their way around themselves.It has long been my policy that ONE OF THE BITERS will makesure that the new vamp is instructed in the ways of the guild.Arranging to have another vamp do the tour is fine, as long asthey have been a vamp long enough to really know their wayaround the guild (that would be bite level or higher). If this crap of biting in new vamps then leaving them to wander around lost happens again, either the Vamp Underlord or I am gonna remove some vamps. If we can't determine who gave the crappy tour, we'll at least remove the fangs of all the biters involved for however long it takes us to stop being ticked off.You will make sure that they know how to use all the commandsavailable to new vamps. You will make sure they know theirway around the guild rooms and the commands available there.You will make sure they know the various routes to the guildrooms. (I've posted these on the guild board for those ofyou that have forgotten. I'm probably gonna add a commandthat lists the routes later.)You're gonna say, what about the new ones that decide theydon't want to stick around for the tour?The policy from now on is this: If the new vamp refuses togo with you for the full tour and/or is obviously not payingany attention, you will mail one of the lieutenants, the Underlordor me with the details of the situation.Guild lieutenants and Assistants you are directed to take twoactions in this situation.  1st, forward a copy of the note to me and the Underlord.  2nd, remove the new vamps fangs.The fangs will not be restored until they indicate that they willgo thru the full tour. If they still refuse, mail me or theUnderlord and they will be expelled.**the fangs were set up a while back to automatically set wizards guild level tothe max. some shithead changed the code and eliminated the test for level >= 21.i noticed something wrong when i saw that keeley (level 6) had the max guildlevel. i fixed the code, but i expect some of the vamps have the max eventhough they shouldn't.the correct levels for each task are:level  task #   desc  3      1      demon priest  4      2      dwarf in mines  7      3      baphomet 12      3      ironwood coffin near sebastian 15      5      kill giants 16      6      triceratops eggthis doesn't mean we need to run around using the 'repair' command tofix everyone's guild task level. (remember that some had solved thembefore I instituted the level requirements) if someone's level seemsodd, ask them which was the last task they completed and adjust itas necessary.**  For some time I've thought the penality for leaving our family to be toomild.  So I've made some changes.  Please read 'help leave guild' and besure that prospective members are aware of this policy BEFORE they arebitten into our fold.  I want new vamps, I don't mind if they leave, butthey must pay a price for it and now will.		-E**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0"
