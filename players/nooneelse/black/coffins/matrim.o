coffin_description "The inside of this coffin is decorated in a plush, fancy manner thatbrings a casino to mind.  Gold lamps, laquered tables, overstuffedchairs, and a long, mahogany bar all contribute to this association.Opposite the bar and table, though, is a very large, comfortable-lookingbed."
