coffin_description "	Through me you pass into the city of woe:	Through me you pass into eternal pain:	Through me among the people lost for aye.	Justice the founder of my fabric moved:	To rear me was the task of power divine,	Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.	Before me things created were none, save things	Eternal, and eternal I endure.	All hope abandon, ye who enter here.		HELL, Devine Comedy		Canto III, ln 1-9		Dante Alighieri"
