coffin_description "You have entered an area of peace and tranquility. This is one of the places that Legend comes to escape the endless politicing of the outside world. The coffin from the outside looked very small, but within this space is a large room. A large fireplace stands on one wall. Above the fireplace is decorated with the heads of slain victims. On the other side of the room is a large plush bed decorated in black satin with velvet draperies. At Legend's desk a sole candle burns fighting a losing battle with the oppressive darkness."
