coffin_description "As you look around, you are overcome by a sense of serenity.  You haveentered, hopefully with permission, Vapors private retreat from theworld.  The ceiling and walls are made of a deep burgundy mahogany.  Thefloor is made out of a solid flawless slate of midnight black obsidian. There is a king size bed angled off in the far corner.  It is covered with adark forest green down comforter and has a huge pile of burgundy and darkblue throw pillows against the hematite headboard.  Amidst the pillowsyou think you see a large teddy bear as white as a fresh snow fall.  Angledin the corner to your left us a comfy looking dark blue couch.  It is the kindof couch that is meant to be sprawled out upon with its extremely softinviting cushions and its silky fabric.  There is a fuzzy blanket draped overthe back...is that a celtic pattern you see?  In the corner to the right isVapors private bar.  It holds all of her favorite private reserves.  Dontbother looking for the key, there is no lock.  Though it wont open foranyone except Vapor.  Does she have a magic touch?"
