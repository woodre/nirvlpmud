coffin_description "You step inside what appears to be Vito Corleone's pizza establishmenton Smoking Boulevard.  Clemenza and his regime's top members are at one booth,and Tessio's are across the room near the Don.  Vito smiles invitingly adhe knowas you as a friend, and has Luca Brasi and Paulie Gatto service youwhile Rocco Lampone gives you your menus.  And to boot, Michael and his wifeKay are across the hall, talking to Fredo and his girlfriend.  It looks likeSonny is in the bathroom at the moment.The Don welcomes you to his restaurant and pulls up a chair for you."
