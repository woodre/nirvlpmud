coffin_description "A rather large room, it seems very poorly kept.  There is a mix of clean clothes and dirty laundry all over the floor.  A table sits on the far left end of the room.  The table is covered with scattered papers and books.Some of those papers appear to be very late unpaid bills.  The walls are covered with posters of the legendary Bruce Lee, members of the New York Knickerbockers, Mets, and beautiful women in bikini.For such a messy room, it's a surprise that it doesn't smell bad at all!"
