coffin_description "WWWW La La....When your eyes become custom to the dim glow of candles in the room, you notice a King size bed against the west wall.  Next to the bed is a bed stand, upon is a little candy jar filled of blood coated candies.Towards the east wall is a table with a vase of beautiful blood red roses.  There is a hugh purple bean bag against the north wall and against the south wall a little table with a bloodachino machine.  There is a gorgeous lush red rug in the middle of the ground.  The room is very warm and cozy."
