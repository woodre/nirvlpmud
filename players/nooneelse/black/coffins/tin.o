coffin_description "Black interior satin greets you as the lid opens slowly.  A dim black draped light shows you what you are stepping into.  For something that looks so small on the outside it seems rather roomy inside.  A stereo with thousands of CD's is pushed against one wall, while pillows of many dark shades line the floor against another.  A big bed covered in all black is in the center of the room, curtains draped around the edges seem somehow inviting.  Softly somewhere in the background, almost as if in your head, you can hear Nine Inch Nails being played."
