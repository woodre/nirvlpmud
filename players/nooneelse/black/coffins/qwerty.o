coffin_description "Sparks fly out at you from a HUGE fireplace. Over the fireplace you can seea shotgun hanging. On the mantle piece there is a picture of Rachael.Covering the floor is a hunter green rug. In the corner there isa stereo which plays a variety of music. (In fact it plays whatever youwish to hear) Let your heart become warm in this house of love."
