coffin_description "*********Velcome to my coffin************As you look around you see that this is a very relaxing place. In the backround you can hear Hootie & the Blowfish playing. there is a arrangementof fresh cut roses on the table in the corner. Next to it you notice a picture of someone that looks very familiar, as you look closer you realizethat it is Cosmo, Screwballs first husband, which she still cares about very dearly. There is also a big dish of green M&M's on the table, you guess thatshe must really like them to. Noticing the nice fluffy bean bag chair in thecorner you walk over and sit down to relax."
