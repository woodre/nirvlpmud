coffin_description "The usual aspects of Newtonian space have obviously been told to bugger off, as there are huge bookshelves lining the walls as far as the eye can see.  The rest of the interior is done in a not altogether unexpected motif of red silk and black velvet, which goes nicely with the rich loam on the floor.  "
