coffin_description "Deep within the darkness of the earth there is a place thatappears to most immortal souls as the land called hell... Black leather covers the walls... and handy hooks allow theheavy chains to dangle nervously around the silk coveredbed that looks dangerously inviting...Welcome... kick your shoes off... relax for a bit..."
