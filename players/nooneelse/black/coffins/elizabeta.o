coffin_description "As you enter, you sense a calmness overcome you.  An erie mist swirlsaround your feet.  The curtains of the canopy over the bed can bedrawn around to conceal anyone withen.  Candles flicker on the cornersand create shapes on the ceiling.  A bookcase takes up one wall and is filled with old books.  The plush burgandy carpet feels wonderful on barefeet.  You see an old music box that plays some long forgotten tune.You are awed by the ornate elegance of the engraved chairs, carved by hand in Italy.  Elizabeta is sitting on one of these chairs, relaxed,but in command of her domain."
