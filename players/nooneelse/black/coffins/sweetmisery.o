coffin_description "Lifeless she walks the streets,Looking for a special treat,The pain she brings is sweet,For with your death comes her immortality.No mortal could ever be like her,Though many wish to be.Alas for for she is one of the dead now.Trapped by the fate of immortality.By Sweet Misery"
