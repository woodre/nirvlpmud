coffin_description "Things are hardly what they seem in this place. Reminiscent of Escher, some walls riseup at odd angles, face unconventional directions, or reflect themselvesabout some unknown focal point. One minute, there is a wall of ooze before you. Thenext, you are looking at a wall of thorns. Such is the highly unstable mind of thiscoffin's owner. He has experimented with all sorts of things in an effort to enhancethe potency of his blood. It has left him slightly off, and such is this coffin.The only constants in this place seem to be the bed on which he sleeps and two chairsset in some unknown focal point for the room that seems to shift at will. Whereverthe chairs may be at a given time, there is a table in between them, on which restsa vial of some liquid and two goblets. Perhaps company is expected."
