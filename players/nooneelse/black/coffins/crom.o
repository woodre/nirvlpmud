coffin_description "You are suprised by the spaciousness in here.You look around and see a small fireplace glowing brightly.Along the left wall you see a bookshelf lined with all the classics.Along the right wall is a cabinet full of most every kind of drinkone might want, especially lots of Ginger Ale, Root Beer and Cream Soda.  In the center of the room you see a huge comfortable looking bed, next to it is a small refrigerator full of food, and on the other sidea small table with a reading lamp.  You defintly feel at ease here."
