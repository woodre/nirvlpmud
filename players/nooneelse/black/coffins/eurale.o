coffin_description "As you lay comfortably in the soft loam, you look up at the closedcoffin lid.  Carved into it's curved surface is the following:Look behind you, my brother.Burning bridges and razed fields.They are gifts of our past.If rains erase us, winds scatter us,Sun consumes us, earth ingests us,   We do not expire!For not even history may purge   Us from her pages.Stories of sorrow behind eyes of fire,Tragedy and bitter angerPumping these black cardiacs.   Vengeful hands,In which burning ichor courses through   betrayed veins,Reach out to right wrongs to names.   We are the Kindred,The Cursed, the Damned, the Undying,The fallen angels of a preverbial god.   We are revenge.     Forever.     We ride!           -Eryn Fadafaicail"
