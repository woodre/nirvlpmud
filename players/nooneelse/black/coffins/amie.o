coffin_description "You enter the room and immediately feel welcome. The wall is decorated with movie posters and photographs. There is a T.V. in the corner of the room and four chairs spread randomly about. The bed is a queen-size canopy and it looks very comfortable. Something in the room makes you feel as though you could stay here forever. "..I know a place where dreams are born, and time is never planned, just think of lovely things and your heart will fly on wings.." is heard coming from the speaker that is hiddin somewhere in the room."
