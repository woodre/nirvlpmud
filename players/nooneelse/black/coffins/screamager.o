coffin_description "You are now in Screamager's coffin.The coffin is covered with satins and velvets of deep red and ebony black, lit only by a soft aura, casting deep shadows amidst the seams and folds.You sense both much love and much loss in this place, the two emotions conflicting just enough to make the other seem more prominent.In the corner lies a large well-used four poster bed, the sheets slightly ruffled, a dark red rose lying on the pillow, a single drop of blood staining the pure white beneath it."
