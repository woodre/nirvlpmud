coffin_description " You seem to have found an ancient crypt. In the center of this room are a paiof lavishly decorated stone sarcophagi. They seem to be made of fine, blackmarble and are heavier and more rounded than traditional coffins. All in all,giving the room a look that reminds you of a mausoleum. Runes have been inlaidwith silver across their surfaces. A covered iron lamp hangs from the ceilingon a fairly thick chain. Like a stilled pendulum it dangles over the center ofthe room. Near one of the sarcophagi stands an elegantly carved, soft bedcrafted of strange black metal and white ivory."
