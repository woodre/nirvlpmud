coffin_description "As you enter Chrys's coffin, you are taken aback by her masteryof Interior Design.  You realize she must be a graduate ofone of those correspondence courses.  The walls are painted black, with black lame material swagged across the walls.  Inthe material, small clear christmas lights are strung, creatinga breathtaking effect.  On the ceiling you see a star map thatglows as you gaze upon it, and on the floor you see a largepentacle with runes inscribed around it.  Crystals and candlesabound in the room, and the incense makes you feel at ease. Thebed is covered in black satin sheets, and has huge overstuffedpillows for you to relax upon.  You notice an armchair in thecorner to sit upon, with an ottoman in front of it. In a hidden panel in the wall is a small refridgerator in which youwill find snacks and drinks to satisfy your needs.  Pleaseleave the chocolate syrup and whipped cream alone, if you wouldas they are for Chrys's more familiar guests."
