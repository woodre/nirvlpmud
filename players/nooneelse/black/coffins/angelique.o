coffin_description "You get a peaceful feeling as you enter ...White satin lines the entire room.The smell of spring rain catches your attention and as you look up you see murals of playfull angels on the ceiling. Although the light is very dim ..you can plainly make out painting from the 14th century on the walls..As the serenity surrounds you..you begin to feel very ..very..relaxed."
