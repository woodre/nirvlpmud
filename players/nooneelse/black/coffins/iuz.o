coffin_description "Iuz's coffin is decorated tastefully in black and silver, with burgandy highlights. A large, plush bed with flannel sheets and wrought-iron bedposts sits in one corner. Next to it is an endtable, with a picture of Adrianna and a small black jewelry box next to it. A large purring cat has taken up residence in the middle of the bed. A fireplace crackles merrily across from the bednext to the fireplce is a small steel safe, with a dagger resting on top of it. The room has a very peculiar feel to it, of both welcoming friends, and sending quiet warnings to enemies. A large bottle of champagne sits next to the bedchilling in a bucket of ice."
