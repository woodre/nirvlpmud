coffin_description "Long straight locks of the midnight skyupon the shoulders of a mountain side.Two dark constant ocean depthsstaring at us all intently.Two shining diamonds perfectly shapedto seek out the red sea of Desire.A shifting object amoung the night;it seems to me the shadow's breath."
