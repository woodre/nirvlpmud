coffin_description "A myth stands before your very eyes...Deep within the shadows Rachael lurks..Giveing you a since of ease. From a chairIn the corner sits a Vampire, His name..Would be Santiago, A wild card in his hand.On this man you can depend. Or your heart heWill bend. Taken from the light..forever to Hide in the night. (Blessed be those who enter here)"
