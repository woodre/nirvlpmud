coffin_description "This room is much larger than you would have imagined.  It is beendecorated entirely with Elizabethan-style decor.  All of the furniture appears to be of pure mahogony, with very ornately carveddecorations adorning it.  There are several lamps about, butthe primary source of light seems to be several candles places about the room, giving a soft, romantic mood.  Soft, gentlemusic fills the air, as does the faint smell of herbal teas."
