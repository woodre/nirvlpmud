coffin_description "You enter Esoterica's sepulchre.The walls are papered with black silk and draped with black velvet and lace.  Moonlight filters through stained-glass windows depicting scenes from great works of literature.At one end of the room there is a huge canopy bed.  The sheets are black satin, and the bed is surrounded by curtains of black velvet.  The pillows look deep and soft and comfortable.Next to the bed there is an antique writing desk, and on it, several leatherbound books, sheafs of parchment, an inkwell, and a quill.A warm fire crackles in the hearth.  There are several thick, white cathedral candles around the room, providing dim light."
