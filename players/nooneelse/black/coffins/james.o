coffin_description "As you step into this dark coffin you see a heart-shaped water bed with a nightstand sitting to the right of it.  Next to the nightstand sits an oak dresser with 4 drawers.  To the far right of the coffin sits a bubbling hot tub.A few meters away from the hot-tub sits a bar with all sorts of liquor bottles on the shelf.  To the left sits a comfy looking couch with many pillows lying on the cushions.  Next to the bouch sits a recliner and an oak table with 4 chairs sitting near it.The room is lit by a single lamp that sits on this table."
