coffin_description "This room is huge.  It seems to be built of stone that is very old,probably from the middle ages.  You see hideous statues ofdemons placed about the room. Many of them are crafted withsuch skill that you are afraid they might start moving about.There is an altar that was probably stolen from a chuch on thenorth side of the room.  There is a black ceramic pitcher on thetable and six silver goblets.  You catch the faint metallic odor ofblood coming from that direction.  By chance you happen to lookup at the ceiling and are stuck with a mixture of wonder andhorror.  A fresco covers most of the ceiling and someartist of amazing talent has painted a scene of a small villagebeing overrun by vampyres.  You can easly pick out tiny detailssuch as the ragged edges of skin around the puncture wounds onsome of the corpses necks, or the little droplets of blood whichstain the clothes of many of the vampyres.  Pulling your gazefrom the ceiling, you turn to examine another stange thing.Hanging in mid-air by some sort of invisible force, is the skin of Khan.  Written on the skin in blood, is the following:	Babette took this skin as a trophy, in	defence of her honor, and the honor of	her eternal family.  "
