The walls, ceiling, and floorare all rounded to form a large sphere covered with padded squaresof red silk. In the center of the room is a large bed with ebony pillars.The bed has black silk pillows on top of blood red silk sheets.There is a lamp suspended from the ceiling right next to the bed.You have seen the master of this room open several of the squares onthe wall and retrieve things from them, but there are no handles foranyone else to open them with..."
