coffin_description "Dragonlord was stupid enough to let Adri sit in here while he was Disconnected, so now I'm going ramble on and on and on and totally screw this up. The room is a complete mess, with chairs overturned and walls kicked in, scribbling on the floor and doors hanging off their hinges. Who could have masterminded such a disaster?If you want to tell dragonlord what a dork he is, email him at Dragonlord2@hotmail.comor call him. his Phone Number is 823-3429"
