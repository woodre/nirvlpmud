coffin_description "Welcome.......you have entered my home, as you look around the room you notice a lava lamp in the corner beside the bed.  You look closer at the bed and notice black silk sheets cover the surface clinging to it like another skin, along with big fluffy pillows, the room is dimmed as the faint sounds of a saxiphone wails in the backround."
