coffin_description "The interior of this coffin is covered by candles looming everywhere and "Ressurection" by FearFactory playing from God know's where. The room's light is a gloomy purplish though many candles burn bright. There are posters of broken hearts, lies, gallows and suicide plastered on the wall.There are so many that you can no longer see the original walls of this coffin but merely posters"
