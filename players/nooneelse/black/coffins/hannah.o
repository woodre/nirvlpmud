coffin_description "0  The walls are lined with a deep red satin, the ceiling is also covered in a deep red satin that cascades across it.  The floor is covered with a soft carpet unlike anything you have ever felt before.  There is an antique cherry desk against one wall with brass knobs.  On it are several different size candles in brass holders all lit.  There is also a matching antique chair in front of it. There is also a large antique grandfather clock with a gold face that tells the time.  There is an overstuffe antique couch with a cherry table in front of it with candles in brass holders all lit as well.  In each of the corners are stone statues of cherubs at play.  There is a light scent of lilacs in the air and a soft glow from the candles giving you a sense of warmth and comfort."
