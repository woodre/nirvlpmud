coffin_description "Long straight locks of the midnight skyUpon the shoulders of a mountain sideTwo dark constant ocean depthsStaring at us all intentlyA pair of diamonds perfectly shapedTo seek out the red sea of DesireA shifting object amoung the nightIt seems to me that the shadows breath"
