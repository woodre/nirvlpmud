coffin_description "The light is dim, the floor is made of a soft thick layerof dirt from the home lands.  A soft feathery bedflowing with red silky sheets has been placed at the farend of the coffin.  There is a fresh scent of blood near,you notice an older looking wine bottle sitting in thedirt next to the bed.  Then you realize the bottle is fullof blood from Katya's last victim."
