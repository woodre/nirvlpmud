coffin_description "As you enter this place, you realize the "coffin" was simply a portal intoa much larger room. The room lacks decoration, a simple bed, a shelf and a lampare the only objects that distract from the sense of utter lonelinesswhich seems to hang in the air with an almost physical prescence.You have entered the stone-cold heart of Silence."
