coffin_description "Herein lies the secret, the soul of intensity...Closely shrouded in black velvet that hangs all over the ceiling & down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon an ebon carpet of the same material & hue.  The luminescent raysof moonlight gleam faintly through a single tall & narrow gothic window ofcrimson-tinted stained glass.  Rich draperies roll from their cornices likecataracts of molten silver trembling to the vibration of low, melancholy musicwhose origin can not be discovered.  Your senses are oppressed by mingled & conflicting perfumes reeking up from strange convolute censers, together withmultitudinous flaring & flickering tongues of emerald & violet fire.  Gazingabout this hall of sable velvet you feel blind & dizzy with the luxuriousnesswhich burns & blazes around you.  In the architecture & embellishments, theintent of this phantasmagoric design evident...simply to dazzle & mystify...."
