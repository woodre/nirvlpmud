coffin_description "As you enter, your eyes must adjust to the darkness, spotted only by the tall purpleflickering candles casting shadows. When you begin to look around, you cannot helpbut notice the decor. Tall velvet curtains line the room, in the deepest purples andgreens you have ever seen. The boudoir becons you further inside. Then, in the corner of the room, you catch a flash of a grin. For some reason, it sends chillsdown your spine. You are nervous, but unmistakably and irreversable drawn tothis image of darkness that you cannot discern. Slowly, cautiously, you movetowards the shape, which as you grow closer, forms a mysterious woman.Her long red hair frames her pale white face. Intense green eyes begin to almostglow and call you further. She is resting on a bed of silks and satins, and her long black gown defines her shapely figure. Welcome to my world of sin, sadism, pleasure, terror, and ecstacy.Dare you stay?"
