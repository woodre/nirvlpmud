coffin_description "- - - - - - - - - -Diabolos' Coffin- - - - - - - - - -  The interior of the coffin is strangely much bigger on the inside than on the outside... (like a TARDIS??)  It is jet black, a darkness that seems to soak up the light and absorb it.  It's pretty freaky lookin'.  The only light source seems to enhance the darkness more than banish it, the light is ghostly pale, an eerie glow from one corner of the room.  Diabolos' only possesions are on the bookshelves in the least shadowy corner, a handful of books, mostly on the black arts, some movies (glancing over the titles you see -From Dusk 'till Dawn-, -Desperado-, -Army of Darkness-, and -Tales From the Crypt, Demon Knight- just to name a few.)"
