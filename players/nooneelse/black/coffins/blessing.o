coffin_description "The heavy wooden lid closes and the clashign of swords and weaving of magic are left behind. Blessing slides a wooden panel from the floor of the casket and turns to you and smiles. As the vampiress takes your hand she pulls thru the opening in the bottom and you drop down with her 5 feet to a dirt walkway beneath the guild. The walls are packed hard of stones and dirt and a musty scent is in the dead air. Quickly blessing leads you thru the dank halways to an opening in the end wall that leads out to a forest. With tiny whimsically steps she smiles and runs to a large crypt surrounded by numerous tombstones. Blessings hand pull at a large iron ring onthe crypt door and it swings open slowly. Inside you see a floor of dirt so soft it seems almost sifted.. Two large stone slabs look almost as benches and an overstuffed pillow made from scraps of satin and silk lays in one corner. The walls are of cracked stones and losened dirt. As you stand and glance about you notice small treasures places on rock ledges that jut from the walls...Blessing takes a deep breath and turns and smiles...welcome to my home..."
