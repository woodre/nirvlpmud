coffin_description "When you enter Gali's coffin you feel like you have stepped into gothic. The stone walls are draped with filmy gauze and there are several candlesticks mounted on them.  Various sized candles light up the room so that the first thing you notice is the huge bed in the center.It is of iron and covered in gauze as well.  There are white pillows of all sizes covering what looks like a comfy down quilt.  Off to one side is an ancient stone writing table.  You can hear theocean through the french doors.  You notice two cats draped on the chaise lounge, all curled into each other."
