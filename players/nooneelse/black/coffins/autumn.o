coffin_description "This is the only place that Autumn feels is safe to come when she wants to be alone. Every once in a while, she might invite someone here to share her grief. There is a chair in the corner and a table at the foot of the bed. The room is not lit very well and there is stains all over the walls. You begin to think that this is the place Autumn brings all of her sacrifices... where she feeds on the life and happiness of others to maker her own depression leave her soul."
