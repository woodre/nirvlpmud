coffin_description "     The inside is made of rough-sawn logs packed tightlytogether giving the air a somewhat woodsy smell.  The dank earthunderneath your feet is from the ages of time.  The stains ofthe blood of countless victims adds an acidity to the air.  Alarge candle is the only light source... casting eerie shadows about."
