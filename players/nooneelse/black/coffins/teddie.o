coffin_description "As you enter you step onto a deep wine plush carpet, the seems to squish between you toes. Looking around the room you see that thereare roses upon the nightstand beside the bed. beside them is a picture of Cosmo. YOu also notice there are many bean bag chairs about the room.Listening carefully you can hear a soothing melody in the backround thatseems to put you right to sleep."
