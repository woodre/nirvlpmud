coffin_description "It seems as though you've stepped into the heart of all darknessin the world.  The presence of evil here is overwhelming, fillingyou with a growing sense of dread.  The interior of the coffin is larger than it seems.  A single candle in the middle of the coffinburns with a strange black flame, illuminating the crimsom colorsand hues which cover everything."
