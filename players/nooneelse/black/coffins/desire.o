coffin_description "Desire's realm is a study in modernism.  Sleek white walls combine with matching white overstuffed leather sofa and loveseat.  A large thick white fur rug covers most of the floor.  Steel and glass tables dot the area.  The effect is warmed by various red throw pillows tossed about.  Her kingsize bed is high off the floor, covered in black silk sheets and black satin coverlet.  About a dozen pillows are stacked at one end of the bed, covered in cases of red, white, and black silk."
