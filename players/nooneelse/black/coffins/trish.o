coffin_description "Welcome to Trish's coffin.  You notice, by the look of things, that Trish isn't a normal vampire.  Everything here is exquisit.  The coffin is linesin a blood red silk, accented with a Robin's egg blue lace trim.  Her tastein decor makes you think that she is not as evil as vampires are conceivedto be, yet the smell of blood and death lead you to think otherwise.  Howcould such a place be both beautiful and foreboding at the same time.  Youstart to wonder if it is safe to be here.  The only way to find out is tostay and remain mezmerized by the Vampire Princess herself."
