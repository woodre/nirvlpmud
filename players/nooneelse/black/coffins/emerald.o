coffin_description "0Emeralds coffin is a homy, comfortable place where she lets go of all inhabitions.  All lights are off, and there are several, sweet smelling candles glowing softly in the dark.  Soft, romantic music can be heard barely above a whisper.  Her bed is covered with white satin sheets and with many pillows freshly fluffed.  Sit on the plush couch, sprawl out on the bed and enjoy the many feelings emerald can bring you.  Inless you're perin, it won't be nearly as inticing."
