coffin_description "You enter a normal 6x3 casket, and find yourself in a large room. It smells like an ashtray, and indeed, there are several overflowing about the room.The room is also littered with empty beer cans, and fast-food wrappers. A television blares nonsense constantly.The sheets on the bed are a dingy grey, and smell of old dreams and lonely sex. There is a patina of dust on everything."
