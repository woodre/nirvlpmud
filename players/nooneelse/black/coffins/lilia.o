coffin_description "The walls and floor are made of dark, grey stones. In one corner,a brass candleholder stands approximately four feet high, and holdsa black candle. The soft light casts eerie shadows across the room.Against the south wall, a mahogany coffin sits on a rectangularpedastal. Elaborate carvings of a moon and stars adorn the sides.On the top of the coffin, a carving of a child vampire kneeling over  a exquisite young man's body, looking toward the heavens with hereyes tightly closed has been carved with great detail and care. Thelid of the coffin is open slightly, revealing a pure black velvetand satin lining."
