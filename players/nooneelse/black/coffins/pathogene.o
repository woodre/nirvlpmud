coffin_description "As you walk in, you find your self trapped in the red paisley pattern, whichcovers the walls. The only illumination comes from a large red lava lamp, inthe center of the room. The furniture is red leather and the carpet is a plushred design. The bed is in the shape of a coffin with black satin sheets andfluffy pillows. "
