coffin_description "You enter into a dimly illuminating room full of books.On a shelf to your right you see stacks of paper backs, mainly entertainment reading and old epic novels like 'The hobbit' and the rest of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.Some new material by Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, Isaac Asimov, Robin Hobb and other great fantasy writers.To your left you have a la-z-boy and a fire place, lit eternally. Over the fireplace you see a portrait of a beautiful woman.The background is a soft green, and then you remember it is the most lovely woman alive...Emerald.On the far wall there are some shelfs with trophies. Some from back in the yound days of Perin.  And on a shelf at eye level you see a picture of what must be Perin's mother, and you think this is a wonderful man with a beautiful wife."
