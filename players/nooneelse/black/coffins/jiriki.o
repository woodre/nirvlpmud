coffin_description "You enter the coffin and find it dimly lit.  There isno real sense of colour in the room, and everythingyou see is covered with shadows.  In fact, everythinghere seems almost to be made of shadows.  Off in a corner you see a computer screen.  It appears Jirikiis logged onto a mud called 3k."
