coffin_description "As you enter Quicksilver's coffin, you suddenly feel a sense of peaceencompass your being.Scanning the room, you see many objects whose use you cannot place.  The roomhas an odd sense about it....Almost as if it had a life of it's own.  As youreyes turn to focus on Quicksilver, you notice that he is reclining on a largebed that resembles none other you have ever seen."
