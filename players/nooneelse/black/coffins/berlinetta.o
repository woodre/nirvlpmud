coffin_description "You stand in the middle of what appears to be a cross between anarmory and the Holiday Inn. From the dark green carpeting and drapesto the uncomfortable-looking bed, the only outstanding featuresare the walls themselves. Weapons and other such souvenirs hang fromeach wall, depicting a different period in the owner's life. The Easternwall is basic black, the Demon Blade and the Battle-Axe Bardiche flanka glass display case containing the small silver Ring of Murder.The Northern wall has a metallic-gray sheen to it, a black ninja garbhangs there with a naginata to one side and a kusari-gama to the other.The Western wall, of a dark well-oiled oak, is adorned by a beautiful suitof elven chainmail on one side and a white-crystal Bardsword crossed againsta delicate lyre on the other. The wall to the South, plain bare stone, issimply decorated with a white shield bearing a large red cross hangingon either side of the door."
