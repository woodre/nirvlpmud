coffin_description "0As you enter Misfit's coffin you notice the strange odor of pickles and rootbeer. A sign on the far wall explains why. The walls are splattered with chicken salad. A picture of a penguin hangs on the right wall. The carpet is covered with stains and there is a large pile of severed pigeon heads in the far left corner. All this disturbs you deeply."
