coffin_description "As you enter the coffin you notice the walls are covered with trophies.Then you notice that they are all skulls.You have never seen so many skulls in one place.You also see an alter to Khorne, the blood god.There are almost as many weapon and armor racks as there are skulls.And in the middle of this gallery of war, is Arbaal."
