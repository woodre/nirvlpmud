coffin_description "A room that seems much larger than its extrerior would have you suspect...A small lamp in the corner lights the room with the mystical blue white light of fairie fire...as it sits upon a very cluttered deskSpellbooks and components abound one of the far shelves and a soft bed lies on the far walll...The room offers and overall inviting serenity that many a vistor might have enjoyed had they survived long enough...."
