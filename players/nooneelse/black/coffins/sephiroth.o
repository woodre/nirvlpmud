coffin_description "This coffin is fully lined with dark red satin.When you touch it, a chill runs down your spineas though you are in the presence of pure evil.You look around to find pictures of Sephiroth,his beautiful wife Zephyra, and their son, Darqmyst. There is also a picture of Jenova,Sephiroth's ugly servant, and Satanis, his loyalwolf. There are old swords of all types liningthe walls, accompanied by ancient scrolls of black magic, which are written in blood. One ofthe scrolls is emitting an especially evil aura.It seems to be written in Sephiroth's hand-writing."
