coffin_description "You enter a hall of darkness. It's so dark that not even the eyes of most.creatures of the night can see. The air smells of vanilla incence.After some time your eyes focus into the darkness and the room becomes clear. You notice there is a pentagram on every wall, each painted a differentcolor. You then notice the large black pentagram on the floor. This is aplace of much spiritual focus and power. You must always speak your truemind here for some reason. *You wonder why?*"
