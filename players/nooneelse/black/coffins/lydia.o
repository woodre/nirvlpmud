coffin_description "Darkness surrounds you and invades your senses. You feel at peace,and welcome here. You can hear Lydia's soft breaths, as well as your own. A gentle melody can be heard playing some distance away.You begin to relax and you soon sense that Lydia is watching you.She gives you an inviting smile and looks away."
