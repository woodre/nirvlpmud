coffin_description "As you enter,your eyes adjust to the darkness here.A small lamp sits in the corner,giving a slight glow to the room and a expensive looking sword collection sits on a wall.On the cobblestone floor sits a bed,simple yet comfortable looking.You wish you could stay here forever."
