coffin_description "As you enter into this room a soft tingle runs down your spine.  A few flamesflicker in the four corners, leaving only shadowy light to tease at your mind.Walking further into the room your eyes almost seem to flood with a deep crimson red as the light from the candles reflect off the walls.  As youreyes adjust a bit, you begin to be able to see the shadowy figures in theroom.  A large desk sits to the right at the far back of the room, withone small oil lamp sitting upon it. Across the room from where you entered is a large couch, that seems to be enveloped in darkness.Glancing to your left you find a large canopy bed encirled in a fine veil ofscarlet that cascades to the floor.  As your eyes follow the veil to thefloor you see what seems to be an oddly shaped trunk sitting atthe foot of the bed...Kiana's coffin."
