coffin_description "Adrianna's coffin is lit warmly by a large fire in the riverrock fireplace.  In front of the fire, there are two chairs and a coffee table, and over the fireplace, on the mantle, standsa picture of Adrianna's daughter Eponine, along with a vase ofroses.  The table opposite you is covered with a black tableclothand set for two.  Separated from the rest of the room by a graceful arch in the wall is Adrianna's bedroom, in which standsher large mahogany bed, with black flannel sheets and lots of comfy pillows.  The place looks very warm and inviting."
