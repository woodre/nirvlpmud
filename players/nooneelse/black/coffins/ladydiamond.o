coffin_description "As you enter this dark and musty coffin, you realize that it MUST be magical, for it is much larger than it appears from the outside.  LadyDiamond reaches over and lights a candle on the mantle of the fireplace, and the fireplace magically lights.  As your eyes adjust to your surroundings you can see there is a very large bed in the corner covered with purple satin sheets.  You can see there are blood dropplets on the pillow which must be from LadyDiamond's recent victums.She sits down in a large highbacked wooden chair, covered with purple velvet.  There are carvings of ancient mystics and the legs on the chair appear to have been the claws of a wild beast, one which you have never seen in your lifetime.  You wonder just how old she must be.Ladydiamonds wolf sits on his large velvet pillow in the corner awaiting her command."
