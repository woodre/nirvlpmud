coffin_description "As you would expect with a magical coffin, this oneis much larger on the inside than the outside.  Dominatingthe room is a broadsword and blank shield on one wall, across from thebed.  A couch and a few chairs are strewn about in front of it.The walls themselves appear to be of stone, with torches that occasionallyare lit, and a thick carpet covers the floor."
