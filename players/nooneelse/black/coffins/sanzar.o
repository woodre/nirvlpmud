coffin_description "A womans touch is prevalent here.You can see Rachael hideing in the shadows.The night lurks around Sanzar's shoulders.A cloak of shadow's envelopes your soul.You have become lost to the coffin.Rachael, smiles at you. You feel at ease.With death, comes beauty. Sanzar and RachaelHave stepped away from the light to WalkInto the night. (peace be with you)"
