coffin_description "You are in a emormous room, carved out of obsidian.  There is a ebony grand piano in the corner, facing the expansive window that covers the entire left wall.  Out the window you can see that you a floating above Mare Infinitus, a beautiful ocean word.  Waves crash and the seas swell in a rythmic motion that mesmerizes you.  Plush couches and chairs decorate this large place, and tapestries and paintings thousands of years old grace every free amount of wall space.  You look down to notice that the rug is acutually a large woven story of the Vampire Guild of Nirvana: The bloodline."
