coffin_description "0Kryllana's chamber is one of delicacy and refineness...lavish velvet tapestriesof burgandy and jade line every corner...solid oak furniture stands at prominant positions in the room.  Over the fireplace is the only picture framed here, the one of Kryllana and her dear Qwerty.  It is a place of homeliness and solitude.  You do feel safe...but do you? *grin*"
