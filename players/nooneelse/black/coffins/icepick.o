coffin_description "You have entered the dimly lit, inner sanctuary of thevampire known as Icepick.  Time stands still in thisforboding lair of eternal night, as a solitary candle oneach wall light this vampire's foreboding lair with an eerie,flickering glow, which only could make a vampire feelcomfortable and relaxed...  Off to one side sits his quietrealm of solitude, consisting of a king size bed with a black,gothic canopy, with a reading lamp and a small library offto the side.  Some exercise equipment sits on the other sideof the bed.  All this is neccessary to keep his undead mindand body fresh, sharp, and focused after his many years onNirvana, so as to ensure him of continued strength inconversation and in battle.  A somewhat disorganized den-likeclutter sits opposite from the bed, including a big-screen T.V.and a home theatre stereo, for when he feels like escapingfrom the dangers of the violence and daylight of the worldabove."
