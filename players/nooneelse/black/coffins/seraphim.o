coffin_description "Seraphim's coffin is designed in a pleasantly techno-modern yet comfortablefashion.  The sleek black console for an impressive sound system is nestleddiscreetly on the shelf and  etherial chants and ambient music oozes out ofconcealed speakers. The floor is an unmarred expanse of polished marble andshimmery slate-grey velvet drapes adorn the walls. Carefully placed halogentrack lights cast brilliant pools of light upon the stereo, the foot of thebed, and the ever-vigilant stone gargoyles.  Under the blue-white light thesheets seem irridescent as the blue-white light bathes the bed in its glow.A sun lamp with a decidely unused look is collecting dust in the corner."
