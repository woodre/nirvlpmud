coffin_description "As the lid of the coffin closes, the bottom opens, revealing a set of stonestairs leading downward.  As you follow the stairs, you notice that it soonopens up into a large, Renaissance-style parlor.  A large, comfortable lookingsofa sits in the middle of the room, with two exquisite sitting chairs facingit in a circle.  There is a large canopy bed against the far wall.  All ofthe furniture looks to be made of pure mahagony.  There are several oldtapestries hanging on the walls, as well as very old, very exquisite rugs onthe floor.  Several strategically placed lamps with dark shades give the rooma cozy atmosphere."
