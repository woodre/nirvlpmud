coffin_description "Dark and forboding, Khrell's coffin conveys the sense of a lonely man on adangerous, obsessive quest for knowledge and power which may destroy him.Against one wall looms a massive oak bookcase filled with dusty tomes on magicand warfare.  Covering another wall are trophies of battles, including the skin of a Shardak's dragon mount.  There also hangs Nightreaper, Khrell's mighty blade, and his ebony platemail, etched with living runes.  An ornatebed rests in the corner, and near it towers an imposing, jewled throne, yetanother trophy of battle.  An extravagently carved desk sits against a far wall, covered with documents, scrolls, and parchments of all manner."
