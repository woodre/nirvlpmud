coffin_description "As you enter into the coffin the room gives you a dark,dismal and gloomy feeling of despair.  This is a directreflection of my dreary life full of heartaches andshattered dreams.  In the corner of the room sits a largecross with a stone gargoyle perched on it, the one reminderof my death and rebirth into the vampire family."
