coffin_description "You have entered the resting place of Zephyra. The walls of the coffin are shrouded in black velvet tapistries that hang all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon the carpet of the same material and hue. A large round bed is pushed against the wall opposit the door from which you entered. It is covered in black satin sheets and large black and red pillows. On either side of the bed there is a small table covered with various sized candles. They are lit and cast a warm glow about the room. On the wall to the left of the bed is a large chest of drawers with a large mirror. On top of the chest is a large flower arangment of black and blood red rosed along with more candles."
