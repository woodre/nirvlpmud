There are a number of ways to get to the guild.  Every vamp should
know the different routes.  Here they are:

  * church,startup (a SPS cost is involved)

  * green, 4w, 12n, w (onyx pillar)

  * green, 5e (pizza hut), 7n, d

Be sure if you're the designated tour giver that you mention this
help file to all new members, it might save them.
