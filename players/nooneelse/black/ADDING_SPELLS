to add spells/abilities to the vamp guild, you must change the following files:

<new_command>.h            - add file to black/lib
<new_command>.hlp          - add file to black/hlp
guild_help.h               - add the new command to the help command
fangs.hlp                  - add the command to the help file
spell_levels.hlp           - add the command to the help file
spell_category.hlp         - add the command to the help file
vampire_fangs.c            - add the new command to the fangs
vampire_fangs_base.c       - add the new command to the fangs base

update both the vampire_fangs and vampire_fangs_base and get new fangs.
