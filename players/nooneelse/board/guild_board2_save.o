messages "traditions(nooneelse, Dec 27, 100):**   It seems some of our traditions are falling by the wayside.  It's   been noted that some of you are biting players three times without   so much as asking over the guild line if this person is acceptable   to the rest of the guild.  I guess I'll have to change the code   back to force 3 different players doing the bite.   AND, I do hope you all remember that failing to show new members   around the guild & how to get to it (not just using 'startup') is   sufficient to annoy me enough to expell you.  One of the members   doing the biting must do this or at least arrange for another member   to do so.**guild rules(nooneelse, Dec 27, 100):**there seems to be some confusion about the biting:anyone who has reached the appropriate level and hasdone the right tasks can bite. you do not need alieutenants ok. if, after talking it over with othervamps of all levels, you decide they should be a vamp,then bite them. ask the lts opinion too since they arevamps too, but the final decision to bite or not isyours and yours alone.there's only one exception to this. if you start bitingplayers into the guild indiscriminately without checkingwith the other vamps, i'll get VERY upset with you.now, as to the tour that is expected. the things thatthe new vamp must be shown are:1. there are 3 different ways to walk to the guild.   the new vamp should be shown the one from the clearing   and the one at the end of the east road.2. they should be shown how to use the startup command3. they should be told the names of the guild lieutenants   and guild wizard so they know who to call if their   fangs crap out.   (tell them that if they forget the names they can    find the list at the top of the lieutenants' office    tower & show them how to get there)4. they should be shown all the rooms and how to use any   special commands available in each of them.5. also, especially remember to tell them about the   sanctuary command. too many young ones are dieing   that don't need to.6. tell them about the tasks. how to get the clue, etc.**guild channel & rules(nooneelse, Dec 27, 100):**it's come to my attention that some of you don't like the way i wantthe guild channel cleaned up.  tough! ths is not a new rule it's a very oldone that is being enforced again.if you're asked to take your conversation to the risque channel DO IT!don't whine about the rule. just follow it.some of you seem to be arguing the rules with the lieutenants. this willachieve two things. 1) it'll bother the lt with something they didn't createand can't change. 2) it'll tick me off at youthe lieutenants are not here to make new rules or to change those i've putin place. they're here to help you if something goes wrong with your fangsand to remid you (forcefully if necessary) of the existing guild rules.if you don't like one of the guild rules i have in place, send ME a letter.state exactly what the rule is you don't like & why you think it isn't right& what you would like to see in it's place.i don't get mad at players that are curious for the reasons for the rules orwant to change something. i do get annoyed at those that rag on people thatweren't responsible for it & can't change it.**language on the guild channel(nooneelse, Dec 27, 100):**Alright! A couple of you are really getting on my nerves!1) I will NOT put a list of offensive words here just so   some jerk who thinks he's funny can come up with one   I didn't think of.2) This is the rule from now on:   Use whatever language/innuendos you want.   If ANYONE expresses the view that it's offensive, then it   stops while that person is on. I don't care if you don't   consider it offensive or not. They do!   This means that if a bunch of cussers are the only ones on,   then they can cuss up a storm with no problems.   It also means that any player that's on that doesn't like it   doesn't have to put up with it. (Under those circumstances   you can just take it to risque. That's what it is for.)   Also, as you start to learn who doesn't like the language,   be nice & cool it as soon as you see them, don't make them   ask.   Don't even bother to try playing word games by saying,   after someone has complained, that ass = donkey. That'll   just tick me off.3) If anyone decides to play rules lawyer & start screwing with   other vamps using this rule when it's not necessary gets   jumped on my me and I won't be in a good mood.   (I will decide if it was unnecessary. If you think someone    is abusing this, mail me their name & the complete circumstances.    I'll talk to everyone involved & jump on whoever ticks me off.)4) Anyone that harrasses a vamp that asks that you cool the language   is gonna get booted.  Harrassment includes demeaning other vamps.   (If ya have problems with the words, look 'em up! Ignorance is    NOT an excuse!)5) Any lieutenant that abuses ANY of the guild rules gets booted.**tours for new vampires(nooneelse, Dec 27, 100):**It has come to my attention that some of you clowns that arehigh enough level to bite new vamps in are palming off yourresponsibilities for the tour onto lower level vamps. In somecases these lower levels vamps are almost too new to reallyknow their way around themselves.It has long been my policy that ONE OF THE BITERS will makesure that the new vamp is instructed in the ways of the guild.Arranging to have another vamp do the tour is fine, as long asthey have been a vamp long enough to really know their wayaround the guild (that would be bite level or higher). If this crap of biting in new vamps then leaving them to wander around lost happens again, either the Vamp Underlord or I am gonna remove some vamps. If we can't determine who gave the crappy tour, we'll at least remove the fangs of all the biters involved for however long it takes us to stop being ticked off.You will make sure that they know how to use all the commandsavailable to new vamps. You will make sure they know theirway around the guild rooms and the commands available there.You will make sure they know the various routes to the guildrooms. (I've posted these on the guild board for those ofyou that have forgotten. I'm probably gonna add a commandthat lists the routes later.)You're gonna say, what about the new ones that decide theydon't want to stick around for the tour?The policy from now on is this: If the new vamp refuses togo with you for the full tour and/or is obviously not payingany attention, you will mail one of the lieutenants, the Underlordor me with the details of the situation.Guild lieutenants and Assistants you are directed to take twoactions in this situation.  1st, forward a copy of the note to me and the Underlord.  2nd, remove the new vamps fangs.The fangs will not be restored until they indicate that they willgo thru the full tour. If they still refuse, mail me or theUnderlord and they will be expelled.**group tasking(nooneelse, Jan 31, 100):**I have no objections to several vamps grouping together tosolve a task, povided none of those in the group has solvedthe task previously.Be aware however, that some are designed so that only oneplayer at a time can actually solve them. (Only one of thegroup would be able to use the 'solve' command each reset.Those in the same group can continue to go back with theother members of that same group and help each other inthis situation, but no new members may be added.)I am wondering though if the clues and hints offered bymore experienced vamps shouldn't be a bit more ambiguousin these situations though. (For now, until I decide, useyour own good judgement)**Vamp Home Page(mouzar, Feb  2, 40):**Hello Vamps,There is a Vampire Home Page located at www.jurai.net/~mouzar/vamp.html.If any of yall want to add your name,email,homepage, or anything elseemail me at mouzar@jurai.net and I'll see about adding it.  If you havesuggestions or comments to add you can also email me.Thanx,Mouzar the Elder Vampire**servant & wolf names(nooneelse, Feb 27, 100):**You will NOT name your servant or wolf after any active player.(For those of you that need clarification, if you are NOT to name them after yourselves either.)Anyone ignoring this rule will be ejected from the guild permanently.**about the tours AGAIN(nooneelse, Mar 20, 80):**i'm getting really tired of having to post notes about this.in case you have forgotten, biting someone in without arranging for them to get a full tour is a banning offense.i've been hearing reports of some of you biting then forcing someone else todo it by leaving. i've also heard that some of you badger other vamps intodoing the tour because you don't feel like it.from now on, the decision on who will give the tour will be madeBEFORE the bites are given. Also, if I hear of a particular vamp thatconsistently dodges giving the tour, I'm gonna be really annoyedat that vamp.**"
