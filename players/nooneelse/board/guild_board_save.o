I'm planning on setting up a group of vamps that wishto fight together and help other newbie vamps out with leveling and equipment.The groups name will be the Malkavians. Email me if you're interested. :)Wicca {Master MaLkAvIaN}**Malks2(wicca, Mar 30, 17):**Just to let people know. My idea for the malks is for thenewbie vamps not for other things. I thought it would benice if a group of players that are on alot could be setas helpers of new vamps and others as a good relationskind of thing. I believe it will inspire others to do the same.Wicca {Master MaLkAvIaN}**WOO HOO!(wicca, Apr  1, 18):**YEAH! Finally I have solved all the guilds tasks. I've very proud of myself. I justwanted you all to know :) Wicca {Master MaLkAvIaN}P.S. VAMPS ROCK!!!!**For Ruby's Sake(sticks, Apr  2, 19):**I'll keep this short, sence I have written far longer notes on this subject.A person wishing to join must find THREE biters Ruby. Only THREE. Then, if those three bite em, they can join.Lets not make this guild into the Knights, where they cant even collectively decide on leadership, let alone on membership.Lets opperate on the KISS system, Keep It Simple Stupid.                                   Sticks**Very Odd(magus, Apr  2, 19):**Does anyone else find the notes from Brightwind and Darkwater odd?  Howcan two players post EXACTLY the same wording on notes?  Sure makes mewonder about them already.**Tux(maxy, Apr  2, 13):**I want my Tux back!!!**Malks post 1(wicca, Apr  3, 18):**Greetings all vamps. My name is Wicca. I am the leader of the guild group Malkavians. The grou is designed to help other vamps in this guild with whateverthey need help on. To anyone who needs help, the following is a list of peoplethat are now Malkavians and will help you if need be:Wicca {Master MaLkAvIaN}ThirdAssyriaPurgatoriAs of yet these are the Vamps involved. Go to them if you need help. We areWelcome to except any new people to the Malkavians. Mail me if you have anyquestions.Wicca {Master MaLkAvIaN}**re Sticks(ruby, Apr  3, 11):**I am aware that you only need 3 biters, i was just expressing my opinionwhich everyone is allowed to haveYour sister,Ruby**Heh(james, Apr  4, 19):**I have to ponder about this new group formed by my Sister Wicca.I thought that as a family we all helped each other out?Is there really a need for a seeperate group designed for that purpose?My name was not on list (prob. b/c I did not mail Wicca) but I still help little vampires out alot.Whether you join this little clan thingy or not it is always a nice gesture to help out other family members:)Well that is my 2 cents worth                                                Forever Dark,                                                -James- (Master Cuttie)**re Heh(stardream, Apr  4, 18):**I would have to say that i agree with James on this onedo we have to form groups to help each other, i thoughtwe all were supposed to help each other no matter whatI guess that since i'm not in the group and don't plan onjoining it, that little ones can't come to me for help?Somehow it doesn't sound right that we should divide up and classify ourselves amoungst our family.  I think you're defeating the purpose of family.  Family's help each otherwe don't need little sub families to be generous and helpfulit should come naturally from all of us, and those who aren'tprepared to help out, should seriously consider leaving thisfamily because thats pretty much what they "signed" up for inthe first place, to be a part of a union amoungst fellow Mudders..ok, 'nuff saidStardream  ~  Keeper of the Stars**"
