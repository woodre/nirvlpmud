messages "Becoming a Vampire(magus, Oct 23, 19):**Put some thought into what you write here.  Many a candidate has been turneddown for lack of thought.  Don't be a lemming and follow the crowd withthe old train of thought.  Be original, creative and witty.  Also, beadvised that it will cost you your life to make this journey so think itover very carefully...**Join(pol, May  2, 6):**Hello.  I've looked through all the guilds and given this some thought.  After talking to a few of your members and seeing what it's like to be a vampire I think this is the place for me.  Of the people I've met I'd be happy to fight for and with these people.  I'm sure my feelings will not change towards any member.  So, in closing, drink me.Pol****Darkness(demios, May 20, 6):**I would like to join the eternal brothers and sister of your guild.  I am drawn to the dark much as many vampires are.  I am fascinated by the guild's history and glory on this MUD.  I have been watching guilds on this MUD for some time and I have decided to apply my services to this guild.  What I can provide for you is a calm quiet majestic bieng who will not interfer with guild wishes and will never put himself above the guild.  I am only level 6 but I am currently maxing my statistics, I have 4/8 of them at 20, Stealth, Strength, Stamina, and Magic.  I am currently working on Luck. If you wish to speak with me I will gladly oblige.  Thank you for your time.      ~Demios**Loyalty(deceit, May 22, 9):**I've played within this realm under many identities and seen the worldfrom many angles,  All of which have lead me to the conclusion that theirlies only one true guild within this mud.  The Vampires.  From what i'veseen and experienced myself from the outside you possess a true loyaltyto eachother.  That is somthing I have within myself, but nowhere to placeit.  I live by a strict and brutal code of loyalty to those I trust.I wont lie to say that I am curtious to everyone around me, but to thoseI trust, there is no loyality in the world that could rival that of mineown, less for the members of this family.  I write tonight in this wakinghour seeking for the chance to join that loyal circle.  No price is toohigh, there is no sacrifice I will not make to become a member of this family,and in time, none too high to protect one of whom I wish to be thine own.In life, in death, above all else in loyalty,                                              Deceit**Til Death Do We Part(pey, May 24, 5):**As my life unfolds I feel the desire to part with the worldly desires I know.  My death would be a relief in the glory of the afterlife.  Many times has my heart desired to resurrect in the powerful form of the bat.  My eternal soul will not rest until it has been offered life after death.  As I speak to those who will listen.......  Till death do us part...Pey**"
