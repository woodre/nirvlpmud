Alchemists cannot wear conventional armor. They must make the armor they wear.
Thus, they have a 'stone skin' spell for use while they are obtaining the
skins (of dead monsters) to make armor from. They will not be able to use the
stone skin spell while wearing any other armor, including the armor they make.

Alchemists must buy their spell components from a guild shop. Their spells cost
a combination of spell points and the cost of the spell components. Thus, just
looking at the <spell>.h file will not show the entire cost. The formula
for this (for combat spells) came from the docs. The cost, in gold, for other
kinds of spells was determined based on the cost for combat spells.

The costs for components are in
/players/nooneelse/Alchemist/alchemist_spell_components
and in
/players/nooneelse/Alchemist/room/component.c (the component shop)
