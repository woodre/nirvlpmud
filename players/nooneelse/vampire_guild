                        Vampire Guild
                        -------------

This is one of the oldest active guilds on Nirvana.

The guildmaster, Nooneelse, has made it a very powerful guild with
many powerful combat spells.  However, he prefers to concentrate his
efforts on 'atmosphere'.

The vampires are able to raise one of their kills as an undead servant.
They can also summon a wolf to aid in combat.

Thus the members have the ability to transform themselves into bats,
wolves and mists.  They can also, when in the guild rooms, summon their
private coffin to rest in or invite friends in for private chats.

The guild rooms are open only to members and include a bulletin board for
use by members only, a shop, a charity room where rich members can leave
treasure for younger or less fortunate members and a private entrance to
a shop where they can purchase many wonderful magical items.
