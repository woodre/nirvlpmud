This is a description of how my Bishops Ring quest is suppopsed to work.

>>> Indicates areas that I intend to expand later


General synopsis:
  The player needs to kill Barnabas, the head vampire in the attic
  of my mansion.  To do this, the player must have some special items:
    a stake made by the woodsmith
    a hammer (anything that id's as a hammer)
    a cross from the lich in my graveyard
    a clove of garlic

  Some things that are not mandatory, but REAL helpful:
    a vial of holy water from the female vampire in the basement of my mansion
    & some really good armor & a really good weapon & lots of $ for healing &
    maybe some friends to help

Specifics:
  How to get:
      A stake made by the woodsmith.  (The stake in the shop will only work
      on the female vampire, not on Barnabas.  The stake from the woodsmith
      will work on either.)
        The woodsmith is in a cabin near the entrance to my area.  Through
        his chats, he tells the player that he wants a bear hide and that
        he will do some woodwork in trade.  The player also must give him
        an oak branch to make the stake from.  Once given both the hide and
        the branch, the player receives a stake.

        To get the oak branch, the player must find the rabbit in the light
          forest and 'remove thorn' or 'pull thorn' from rabbits paw to get
          some mistletoe.

          The player must take the mistletoe through the maze in the dark
          forest in my area to the druid.
          (The correct path from the light forest: n s w w s e s s n w s s)
          The player gives the mistletoe to the druid & receives an oak branch.
        >>> Later:  Will be moved to a larger area so he's harder to find

          To get the bear hide, the player must follow a path through the
          maze in the dark forest in my area to find the trapper.
          (The correct path from the light forest: n e w w s s n w)
        >>> Later:  Will be moved to a larger area so he's harder to find

          The player must lead the trapper to the bears using the commands
          'say south', 'say north', 'say east', 'say west'.
          (The correct path through the maze to the bears, from the trapper:
           e w e e s n s e s e)
          (The correct path through the maze to the bears, from light forest:
           e w e e s n s e s e)
          When the trapper & player are in the room just outside the cave & the
          players type 'say east', the trapper will give the player a bear hide.
          (The momma bear has a bear skin as treasure.  That's not the item the
           woodsmith wants. :)
        >>> Later:  Will be moved to a larger area so he's harder to find

      A hammer.
        The hammer can be anything that answers to 'hammer'.  The clerk in
        the souvenir shop near the entrance to my area has one.

      A vial of holy water from the female vampire in the basement of my
      mansion.
        To find her, the player must find the kitchen in the mansion and
        pump the handle on the water pump three times.  This unlocks the
        secret door in the pantry off the kitchen and fills the water glass
        (which is used to get to Barnabas).
        She's tough.  She must be knocked down with standard combat techniques.
        When it looks like she dies, the player has only a few moments to type
        'stake vampire', 'pound stake', 'pound stake into vampire',
        'drive stake' or 'drive stake into vampire'.  If the player has both
        a stake and a hammer, the vampire dies for real & the player gets
        some treasure & exp.  If the vampire is not staked within the time
        limit, the vampire regenerates fully and laughs at the player.

      A cross from the lich in my graveyard.
        In the light forest are two different quarys.  In each is a stone
        golem that has a key.  The player needs both keys.

        The player must then find the graveyard in the light forest.
        In there is a mimic that looks like a chest.  It has an icon with
        some writing on it.  The writing is a clue that the icon must be
        placed on the pedestal in one of the lower crypts.
        >>> Later:  Will be moved to a larger area so he's harder to find
        >>>         Will probably expand the crypts & graves & hide the mimic
        >>>         in there somewhere

        In both the northwest and northeast corners of the graveyard are
        crypts.  The doors in them are the ones the golems keys are for.
        Through those doors & down, takes the player to the liches room.
        The lich starts in the lower room of the east crypt.  The player
        must 'put icon on pedestal', 'place icon on pedestal',
        'set icon on pedestal' or 'sit icon on pedestal'.  (Once placed, it
        cannot be removed, except by the next reset.)

        The player must then kill the lich.  (If the lich is being killed in
        the east crypt, the icon must have been placed in the west crypt on
        the pedestal.  If the lich is being killed in the west crypt, the icon
        must have been placed in the east crypt on the pedestal.  If the icon
        has not been placed, the lich regenerates & goes to the other crypt.
        If the icon has been placed, the lich dies & the player gets the cross.)

      A clove of garlic.
        This one is easy/hard.  All the player has to do to find this is go to
        the highest mountain peak.  Then 'say' something.  There'll be an
        'echo' then in a couple of minutes a sphinx will appear.  If you
        answer his riddle correctly, you will get a hint on killing the vampire
        and a hint to 'follow your nose'.  If you sniff in that room after
        getting the hint, you'll find the garlic.

      Ok.  Now that we have all that, we have to find the maze in the attic
      of the mansion, solve it and kill Barnabas.
        To get to the maze in the attic, the player must pump the handle on
        the water pump in the kitchen, while the glass is sitting there.  This
        fills the glass with water.  The player then goes to the study and
        types 'throw water on fire' or 'pour water on fire' to put the fire out.
        Then the player types 'touch amulet to indentation',
        'put amulet in indentation', 'place amulet to indentation' or
        'place amulet in indentation'.  When they do that, they're teleported
        to the entrance to the maze in the attic.  They must defeat the
        doppleganger to enter the maze.
        (The correct path in: changes with every reset)
        (The correct path out: s takes them to the doppleganger room)

        Once the maze is solved, the player finds Barnabas' coffin room.
        (The player MUST have all the items or Barnabas will throw them
         out to the entrance of the mansion.)
        He's tough.  He must be knocked down with standard combat techniques.
        When it looks like he dies, the player has only a few moments to type
        'stake vampire', 'pound stake', 'pound stake into vampire',
        'drive stake' or 'drive stake into vampire'.  If the player has both
        a stake and a hammer, the vampire dies for real & the player gets
        some treasure & exp.  If the vampire is not staked within the time
        limit, the vampire regenerates fully and laughs at the player.

  Oh yeah, one note:  In the basement of the mansion is an alchemist.  He has
                      a ring that's cursed.  If the player takes it, they
                      will begin dropping things at random, like a coin, a
                      piece of armor, a weapon, something random.  They cannot
                      get rid of the ring unless they go to the adventurer's
                      guild and drop the ring.
