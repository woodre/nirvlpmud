The caverns of the Durkor.
-------------------------------------------

The caverns are going to be filled with the Durkor 
race. Warriors, mages, scouts, and guards starting 
at the second level of the cavern.  The first level
I'm planning to make just small mobs. They will 
gradually get larger the deeper into the cavern one
goes.  At the bottom level will be a large cavern
of several rooms where the person will fight a 
large dragon.  Some places will be left for expansion
at a later time.
