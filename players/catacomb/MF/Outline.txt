Meserir Forest
-----------------
This area is going to be basically about 5 main areas within 
it the only really big area will be the forest with about 20 
rooms. The other areas will be a small river area, an elven
village(with shop and tavern), a marsh area, and A clearing
between the forest and marsh.  figured it would be tailored
to mid to high.

-------------------------
History of Meserir Forest
-------------------------
The Shamot elves talk of an isolated forest on the other side
of the river that runs by their small village.  Thus begins 
the story of Yeroc the Nomad.  In the Shamot's history their 
have been many stories as to how Meserir forest came into 
being.  Some say it is an evil that has developed from their
own evil deeds, kind of a karma that has come back to haunt
them.  Others believe that it is the resting place of demons,
and evils the world refuses to acknowledge.  Other Shamot
recall the story of Yeroc and the madness that he has brought
to the once lovely forest.  Only a select few have entered and
returned to recall the horific sites they had seen.  The only
way to know the truth is to search the cursed forest and 
discover the true nature of the beast.
