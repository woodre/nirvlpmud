Approval Notes for
Catacomb's Barbarian Tribe Area
by Feldegast
3/16/01

  These are the notes and comments that I wrote down while going 
over your Barbarian Tribe area.  You had very few typos, and I did
not see very many major technical errors.
  The theme was enjoyable, even though it is hard to really get
into a theme for a first area because they are required to be so
small.
  Although some of your descriptions are a little rough, you displayed
good imagination in many of them and I'm sure you will get better with
time.
  Many of the notes that I've written fall into two categories:
    1. This must be fixed.
    2. Changing this will make your area better(in my opinion).
  The first category refers to bugs, typoes, and most references
that I might've made to hard numbers(and these can be argued about).
The second category refers to things that in my experience make an
area neater, more enjoyable to play in, or simply earn the respect
of your peers.  I don't always specify which notes fall into this
category, so if you aren't sure, ask.  If you aren't sure why I'm
making a suggestion, then you should also ask.  If you feel that
my suggestion conflicts with an effect, mood, or experiment that
you were attempting, then by all means, give it a shot.  I'm not
writing these notes to cramp your style or force you to conform,
but merely to help you make your area better.

General Notes
=============

Short descriptions:
  Although 3-4 lines are nice, if you can't come up with that much,
don't just make the lines shorter.  Just be consistent.  Hopefully,
writing descriptions will become easier in time.

Monster cloning:
  Monsters should be cloned from the reset function, which is called
with an arg of 0 when an object is first created, and an argument of
1 at regular intervals (resets).  In most of the rooms that I checked,
you were cloning monsters in the init() function, which is called
whenever a player enters a room.  In effect, the monster is recloned
every time the monster is dead and the player re-enters the room.
  Try this:

    reset(arg) {
      /* Clone a monster. */
      if(!present("monster"))
        move_object(clone_object("monster"), this_object());
      if(arg) return;
      /* Do stuff that doesn't need to be redone later, such as
         setting room descriptions. */
    }

A brief note about memory:
  When you declare a variable such as an object or int, the compiler
allocates a piece of memory for that variable.  When you create a
global variable, that piece of memory is allocated for as long as
the object is around.  However, if you put the variable in a function,
the space in memory will be deallocated when the function ends.
When you are cloning an object, such as a hammer, you do this:

  object ob; /* allocates a POINTER to an object */
  ob = clone_object(filename); /* Creates an object and points ob at it. */
  move_object(ob, this_object());

If ob is declared globally (outside of a function) then the memory
will not be deallocated and will be wasted, since you don't need that
variable anymore.  If you make it 'local' to the reset function, then
it will be deallocated when the function ends.  Although it doesn't
save enough memory to make it worth going back and fixing, you should
remember this for your next area.

Treasures:
  Many of the items in this area mention in their description that they
can be sold somewhere(at the medicine man?), but the functionality for
doing so doesn't exist.
  
Room-by-room notes:
------------------

cave.c -
  For future reference, you should try to avoid sentences that use the word
'you' in room descriptions.  Descriptions should describe the terrain, not
the actions that the player is taking.  See /open/essays/rooms.txt for more
information.
  You should not describe the medicine man in the room description either,
as he might be killed or otherwise removed.  The item description 'man'
will block the players from seeing the actual man.
  The method you have of entering different areas seems a bit counter-
intuitive.  You say right away that I can 'trace' the glyphs, but the command
'trace glyphs' gets me 'Trace what?' (you forgot a \n, btw).  I knew that
you intended for me to 'trace forest' because I looked at the code, but
this might take a while for the players to figure out.  I suggest that
you change the error message for 'trace' to 'You may trace: forest, blah, bleh.'
where blah and bleh will be your future areas.  
  nahog.c - The description indicates that the medicine man sells stuff,
    but he doesn't actually sell anything.  Isn't that a little misleading?
    In spell_mess1, you misspelled SCREAM.

barbentrance.c -
  You misspelled vegetation in several of the item descriptions.  Also,
in the description for 'vegetation', you have a grammatical error.
  There is no cave mentioned in the room description, yet it is listed
as an 'obvious exit'?  Oh, and you have a grammatical error in the 'cave'
description.

barbforest1.c -
  The word 'appears' in the long description should be 'appear'.
  Although I arrived in this room by going southeast, to return
from where I came from, I must go 'clearing'.  Although I certainly
don't object to unusual exits, you should be consistent in their usage.
If I have to go 'clearing' to get back, perhaps to get here I should go
'forest' or 'bushes'?
  The code you have for cloning the snake should be in the reset function
rather than the init function.  Remember, reset is called when the room
is cloned, and then at regular intervals of about half an hour(?).  The
init function is called whenever a player enters the room.

barbforest2.c -
  Good.

barbforest3.c -
  Regarding the final sentence in this room's description, what if I had
not typed 'listen' earlier?

barbforest4.c - 
  Why can I go south to barbforest1, but I can't get back here from there?
  In several of your item descriptions, you need to replace 'leafs' with
'leaves'.
  In the 'mountain' description, ranges should be singular.

barbforest5.c -
  You need to change the verb 'smell' to 'listen'.
  Change 'block' to 'blocks' in the mountain and range descriptions.

barbforest6.c -
  The width of this description is a little on the short side.
  The 'listen' description could use some work...
  You describe a nest with some sort of monstrosity in it, but there's
no monstrosity?  If you're talking about the stirges in the next room,
then perhaps you should make it clearer that the nest is in the trees
to the east?

barbforest7.c -
  This description is a little 'thin' as well.  It's okay to have a room
with a short description every now and then, just try to be consistent in
the line length.

  stirge.c -
    You put a /n into the spell emote instead of a \n.
    You can't insert the name of the attacker when you are setting spell
   messages.  As I mentioned earlier, the reset function is called when
   the monster is first cloned.  In order to change the spell message
   to use the attacker's name, you need to change the heartbeat function.
   For example:

heart_beat() {                  /* The heart_beat function is called every few seconds. */
  if(attacker_ob)               /* Check to see if the monster is fighting anything. */
    set_spell_mess1(            /* Change the spell message. */
      "The stirge flies in low at "+ATN+".  The stirge buries its\n"+
      "beak into "+ATN+"'s neck.\n");
  ::heart_beat();              /* This calls the monster's normal heartbeat, and possibly a spell. */
}

barbVilEnt.c -
  Is there some reason this room's description is indented one space on
every line?  I have nothing against the idea, it just seems odd that
you did it for just this room.
  Again, in the room description you are referring to monsters that may
later be killed.
    barb2.c -
      You forgot the lines:
        move_object(hammer, this_object());
        init_command("wield hammer");
      at the end of the reset function.
      hammer.c -
        This weapon would be of club type.
        You shouldn't describe this weapon as being of good manufacture
      if it is only wc9.  A newbie sword is wc12, if I'm not mistaken.
      In fact, maybe you should just raise it to wc15. 

barbvil2.c -
  This is your first mention of the 'Clan of the Snake' concept.  You
might want to provide a little more exposition here, or maybe provide it
in the previous room before the player enters the village.

barbvill.c -
  Good.

  barb3.c -
    Good description.
    Don't forget to move his cloak on to him(see barb2.c above).

barbvil3.c -
  You describe guards who guard the door to the southeast, but
when I walk southeast I walk right past them.  Are they just
slacking off or what? :)

chieftent.c -
  "...BY all the light in here."

  barb1.c -
    Good.  But...The second sentence of his spell attack has no noun.
    Rbrkr.c -
      Considering this weapon's description, perhaps a weight of 3-4 would
    be more appropriate?  Also, perhaps you should change:
      if(random (100) > 85 )    
              to
      if(random(this_player()->query_attrib("str")) > 17) 

    Then strength will become the prerequisite rather than total randomness.

gnollentrance.c -
  Garbage and feces ARE everywhere.
  You might want to describe the tents.

  gnoll2.c -
    Its alias should probably be 'guard'.

gnollvil1.c -
  Going west here takes me to the gnollvil3, but I have to go southeast
to get back?
  This description isn't terribly inspired...I'm not going to make it a
requirement, but it might be a good idea to go back and redo it.

gnollvil3.c -
  shaman.c -
    Nice use of color, but you might want to put the spell emote on just
  one line instead of two, or maybe centering it on the screen.


Conclusion
==========
  When you're done making these corrections, and you've discussed any points
that you'd like with me, I will mail Boltar and he will add your castle to
the init_file, you can make an announcement on the board, I can promote you
to level 30, and a good time will be had by all.
