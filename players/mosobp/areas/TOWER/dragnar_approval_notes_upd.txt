		o In heal_check function this line needs to be updated either to
      have a message to make it a blank string:
      "\t\t\tPiccolo Energy burst spell, message can be removed after testing\n",
		o Might be best to remove HB sections that are commented out.
		o Total loot needs to be a max of 11,000 including gear.
      I would suggest 7000 + r(4000) which is 9k plus 2k for armor.
    o Needs bonus for healing: set_hp_bonus(1500);
	* korrin.c
		o OK. Sure you don't want to put the beans in now?
	* mustard.c
		o OK
	* nappa.c
		o  OK, coins could be as high as r(5500) which would average 2750.
	* piccolo.c
		o Gold still needs to be lowered. Max for level 27 is 17,500. Gold is currently at
      16,500 and he has 2 armor worth over 3k.
      Suggest 10,000 + r(9000) avg of 14,500 coins
