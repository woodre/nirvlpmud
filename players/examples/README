             /players/examples   -  Nirvana's LPC-example area
*******************************************************************************

PURPOSE: This area is intended to show LPC examples which are technically
-------- up to date and which contain most of the features that are necessary
for creating an own area in Nirvana.  Refer to ~/INDEX or ~/doc/contents for a
list of features shown in the examples.

AREA USAGE REMARKS: Wander around in the rooms, beginning in ~/room/start.
------------------- Read the plate with the contents there (and the tablet
with the sins, too :)).  Then go and explore.  We built an - admittedly
very silly - quest which you may solve.  But it's not the main task to solve
the quest, it rather is to look at the code and study it.  So use the Robe
of Sorcery's More command ('More here', 'More beerie', ...) whereever you
like.  The Robe of Sorcery can be found under /obj/tools/newrobe).  You also
may copy some of the files into your directory and fit them to your needs.

IMPROVE AND EXTEND THE AREA: We're still at the very beginning of such an
---------------------------- example area.  It is rather small.  Hopefully it
will be extended in the near future.  There are indeed further ideas which
may be implemented here.  If YOU also have ideas on how to improve or extend
this area, please DO contact the admin.

RULES FOR EXTENSION:
--------------------

 1) Suppose you have ideas which should be regarded here in this area.  Then
    don't hesitate, contact the administration and talk about them!

 2) You should only add code to this area when you're absolutely sure that
    it is technically okay, up to date and that the feature you want to show
    is well documented in the file.  If you aren't perfectly sure about that, 
    please contact the admin and ask.

 3) When adding code to this area don't forget to update the ~/INDEX file and,
    that's even more important, the ~/doc/contents file by adding the feature,
    what it does and where it can be found.

 4) When adding new rooms make sure that they are logically connected to
    existing rooms so that it is possible to walk through the entire area.
    Also add new rooms to the ~/doc/map file.  When adding items make sure
    that they can be obtained by some action in one of the rooms.

NOTE:
-----

A now and then updated .tgz file of this area can be obtained via Nirvana's
ftp facility
