inherit "complex/room";


// Nothing more to do yet. It's wise to inherit an own room into your rooms
// instead of complex/room from the very start. This is due to an imminent
// or later need to add special features in all of your rooms. If the class
// complex/room suits your needs, then do nothing but inheriting it. If you
// discover later that you would like to add special features or functions to
// ALL your rooms, then you'll just have to add it in your room class and not
// in each of your rooms.
