Wizard First Area

  Everyone is usually excited about coding their first area and get-
ting it into play.  This sometimes leads to problems such as bad or
not thought through ideas, duplication of area ideas, poor looking
room descriptions, etc.  In order to make sure there is some sort
of uniformity in code here, your first area must meet the following
requirements:

	*15 - 20 rooms max
		Each room should have its own description. Nothing
		is more boring to players than to read the same
		description over and over again.  Proper grammar
		and punctuation should be used and that includes
		two (2) spaces after the ends of sentences.  The
		room description should be 3-6 lines in length and
		the length of each line should be approximately 70
		characters.  Obviously short or mismatched line
		lengths will not be permitted.

	*7 - 10 monsters
		This should be a low to mid level area so keep your
		monsters straight-forward.  Monsters that would not
		normally be carrying money (i.e. dinosaurs) should
		not have any.  Code some item that can be sold for
		the value of gold.  Put some thought into this process
		and you'll find that players will visit more often just
		because it's entertaining.

  The biggest problem with new areas is the descriptions.  When you 'look'
at an item, you should get a description of what you see.  Too often you
get all kinds of information EXCEPT what the item looks like.  When I walk
into a room, I want to see what the room looks like, what's in it, etc. 
The same holds true for monsters.  When I look at the monster, I want to
see a description of the monster.  You must pretend you are the eyes of the
player.  When that is done, look at your room descriptions and make sure
there are item descriptions for every noun mentioned in the description.
Then look at the item descriptions and make sure you have the nouns in them
covered as well.  It's very frustrating for both coder and checker when all
the work put in was for naught because it didn't do the right things.  Use
your imagination and MAKE the player see what you envisioned when you wrote
the code.  A suggestion:  Only do a couple of rooms and then have someone
take a look at them to make sure you're on the right track.  That way you
won't have tons of stuff to redo.. just a wee bit.

  It's not uncommon for new wizards to want to code an area with way
too many monsters of maximum exp so that their area becomes a
'slaughter house' of sorts where players go and mass kill.  Make your
monsters unique and keep to a theme.  It doesn't make sense to find
dinosaurs in outer space for example.  Once you've made a directory
with the appropriate name, put NPC and OBJ directories inside it to
keep your monsters and items they might have in the same general
directory.  This will also make it easier for whoever goes over your
area to find the things they need to.  Also, there should be a README
file in the directory explaining the area and any important facts
concerning the same.

  Do not get too fancy with your code in this first area.
