  This area is supposed to simulate a floating chess board.  The unique part
about it is that if a player attacks a piece of a given color, all the other
pieces of that color become aggro to him for the remainder of the reboot
period.  The monsters are pretty straight-forward with the three largest (King,
Queen, Bishop having good but unstorable armor.

  A special thanks to Maledicta for helping me set up the aggro system.
