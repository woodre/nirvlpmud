   Wed Jul 26 16:31:45 2000     first reaction is that the weapon has a lot of advantages with the only disadvantage being it is non storable.  Mailed the other seniors for reations.
   Wed Jul 26 20:58:01 2000     Added a check to ~/saber/armor/aura.c so that the 'banshee' function couldn't be called in no_fight rooms.
