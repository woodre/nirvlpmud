messages "Alliances(magus, Oct 12, 2000):**If your alliance with any other person in any other guild interferes withany vampire family member, you better rethink it.  Family ALWAYS comes first.**Blood/Pets/Misc(eurale, Jul  2, 2005):**Your blood energy level is available on you 'sc' screen so all one has todo is look at it.  I was designed to be 'less than totally accurate'.  Petscan be monitored as per Sticks note pretty easily.  Lastly, I better notfind anyone biting a new app without waiting the appropriate time or they'llalso be looking for a guild to join.  Don't think this isn't being monitoredas you'll be wrong.**In the works (07/06/09)(khrell, Jul  6 2009):**Today (07/06/09) I have started working on new spells for the vampires.First up I am working on a deathblow/fatal/end move spell that will beimplemented once it is working and approved, I would like to hear fromyou all your ideas what the spell should say, as to what it does, wellit really should be self-explanitory what it does.-Khrell (the redundantly posting wizard of the vampires)**Waiting time for applicants(khrell, Jul 13 2009):**It has been decided that applicants will wait a minimum of three days, since there is norules stating any sort of waiting time I was able to find/see.  This applies to the timethey did post.-Khrell**New Spells(saphira, Sep  6 2009):**I like the idea for the new spells Khrell.I think the fatal would probably be good because it should do more damage thanthe strongest spell we have, which I think is demon. Most other guilds havea finishing spell but us. So that kind of spell would be really good!Maybe you might add another trail so we can get these spells, for a higher lvl in vamps.but I am not sure everyone would agree with that. If not then that is ok.I personally like the spells you are thinking of. Kudos to you Khrell!In the darkness,Saphira**New Spell(nelapsi, Jan 16 2010):**Greetings my Borthers and Sisters...   I want to add my two sense in on the possible new spell...I like Saphira idea of a Fatal and adding a new trialwith a new level.            Nelapsi  vv**Biting(baddin, Aug 22 2010):**Hello Family.   I just want to alert everyone to remember do not be free with your biting.We have rituals and a gathering room.We vampirs always have pride ourselves in ow class, and taste.   I would like to see all bites done at same time. and with dignity and roleplaying. If you do not wish to particpate. post it. lets talk,  Coomunication family.Servant of the Family    Baddin**Biting.(alexis, Aug 22 2010):**My beloved Family,I must chime in my emphatic agreement with our wise leader, Baddin.  We have a long and distinguished history of choosing applicants with great carebecause not everyone, irrespective of their strength or fighting prowess, hasthe necessary skills and personality to become members of our Family.  It dilutes the honor of being asked to join us if we simply bite freely, with little consideration, and with no ceremony.  Many of our elders sleep, but their ways andtheir wisdom should not be forgotten by this generation.  When we agree toinvite someone to join our Family, we are truly adopting them, and shouldshoulder the same responsibilities as if adopting a child.  When we bite,there is a death and a birth, and we need to treat the event with all ofthe solemnness and joy attendant upon those events.  These are my humblethoughts, my sweet Family.Your devoted sister,Alexis**titles(shojiro, Aug 22 2010):**We need us some more colorful titles that we can obtain with are levels since levels have been uped to +100maybe suggestions and ideas from everyone could help khrell to add them if he sees fit!You Brother,shojiro**Re: Biting(shojiro, Aug 22 2010):**I, truly understand and agree with you all, for all the wisdom passed down from  the elders has kept you going as well as you passing this on down to me i will learn and grow to be even more knowledged in the family. I do apologize if i seemed abit eager at first. We all have to learn I guess. But to my family i am forever loyal and give my trust. I seek to gain more and more knowledge and learn more.Your Brother,Shojiro**combat suggestion.(shojiro, Aug 22 2010):**Maybe a spell to start a fight since vampires are known for the stealth and quickness. to be able to provide an open strike to a fight only once at the beginning of battle would be very intresting. with a chance of failure of course to connect with it!You Brother, Shojiro**Historian of Family(shojiro, Aug 22 2010):**Maybe a spot in the family that can record and write our history more into depth and keep recording so that are family history might grow as we go through the ages.**Biting(khrell, Aug 23 2010):**It distresses me to once again see a topic on Biting.  I understand the eagerness of someto grow the family but we have never been one to have large growing pains.  I hope bitingis not being done under mob mentality, in that what a few do the rest follow suit.Baddin is law here, if you defy him you will be delt with painfully, if you have somethingyou need addressed that I can deal with, mail me.We are a family here, and I do like a sense of unity.  Play nice, this is a game afterall.-Khrell**fangs(ozzy, Aug 24 2010):**i have noticed that we heal better than some giulds when we use our "decorpse" i hope this idea appeals to some. i thought that pehapes out family could be the only to have the ability to toggle our fangs to heal either hps or sps as some us go threw one faster than the other just a suggestion thnx for listening! humble servant to the family, ozzy**Damn(illarion, Sep  1 2010):**Damn has been adjusted.  It now costs inline with how much it hurts.However, it was also broken before and not working at all.**Clan(nelapsi, Nov 13 2011):**Greeting my Brothers and Sisters,    I recently have been playing more and waswondering if there is a common Clan we areusing?  I would much prefer to be in a clanwith my brothers and sisters, than make my own solo clan.  Let me know!   Nelapsi vv**"
