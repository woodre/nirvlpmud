messages "Alliances(magus, Oct 12, 2000):**If your alliance with any other person in any other guild interferes withany vampire family member, you better rethink it.  Family ALWAYS comes first.**pk power(sticks, Apr 16, 2005):**Ummm...take a look at what ya got guys.1. levitate...a very powerful escape trick.2.  demon spell...as powerful as is legal...bar none.3.  vamp heals right outside the guild hall...(almost illegal)4.  some very nice pk spells and guild abilities...5.  a wolf which is one HELL of a powerful guild pet6.  a wolf pet that works in conjunction with a mud pet 7.  a heal spell (unlimited and it will spam) for pk...8.  a guild hall that is totally safe from pk...9.  a weapon class bonus (nobody else has this) 10.  lots of cool spells (almost all of them) for mud play.I do agree...we do not seem to hit hard in pk...but many guilds are overpowered.  If two vampires wereto hunt in pk together, they would be deadly.I will lend my blade to yours anytime...but Iseem to be about the only pk vamp around...???I'd love to have some help...and share the fun!                     Sticks the Elder Vampire (still kicking)**Coffin storage(eurale, May 25, 2005):**The problem is not with the coffin storage but with the coffin storers.When you store somethink with 'store knife 2' and months later come backand try to retrieve it with 'retrieve knife' it will not work.  You needthe same syntax you used to store it to retrieve it.  When you forget,that means going into the file to see just exactly what you called yourprized possession when you stored it.  If you try all the possibilitiesand still can't get it out, mail me with the item name and I'll try tolook it up.  (Nice typos huh?)**Blood/Pets/Misc(eurale, Jul  2, 2005):**Your blood energy level is available on you 'sc' screen so all one has todo is look at it.  I was designed to be 'less than totally accurate'.  Petscan be monitored as per Sticks note pretty easily.  Lastly, I better notfind anyone biting a new app without waiting the appropriate time or they'llalso be looking for a guild to join.  Don't think this isn't being monitoredas you'll be wrong.**Morrigan(solitare, Jul 10, 2006):**Interesting, if long winded, note she posted.Granted some of us vamps long in the tooth (literally)do ramble on and on and on and on and on and on....Well I woke up and haven't seen this one on when I wasawake.   Sadly I would like the prospect of speakingto them as well, not often mortals will engage anyof us in a meaningful conversation, let alone writea looooooong note.  Kudos to Hott for at least finishingit and admitting to falling asleep.  Too many words andI find myself skimming things over for the meat of whatis being written.  Well anyways if this Morrigan isstill interested in us, I'll be more then happy to tryand speak to her and give my verbal two-cents.-The Solitare.**2 new app(saphira, Sep 12, 2006):**what does everyone think of new apps?you sister in darknessSaphira**re: new apps....(solitare, Sep 22, 2006):**Hellkat was less then civil towards some of us a few weeks back, soI'd have to say no.-The Solitare**Elizabeta(solitare, Sep 23, 2006):**An ancient name from ages past has returned to the realms.  I remember herfrom those times.  I would bite her again, but according to our recordsshe never did leave the guild, just had her character purged from therealms.  Gotta observe our way of doing things and I will hold backfrom biting until I hear word.-The Solitare**Elizabeta(tifa, Sep 23, 2006):**Rebiting?  She could always ask if she can get reinstatedby Boltar. I had to.T**Elizabeta(nelapsi, Sep 24, 2006):**Greetings   In the past we have had old members who stopplaying and had their chara wiped. They have have not allowed them back in the family unless Boltarhas reinstated their chara. The reason has alwayssbeen if you leave the family or don't take thetime to inactivate your chara so it is not wipedthen you should not be allowed back in.Something to think about.            Nelapsi the Night Stalker ;)**Bitting Applicants Consolidated(nelapsi, Sep 27, 2006):**Personally, my feeling is this guild should be a person'ssole purpose and end. Thus, I will NOT bite anyonewho has been in another guild prior to this one. Thats just my little 'rule'.As far as our guild goes, I have been, for the mostpart, the only one here most of the time. Its nice to see some others around...and as far as discussionon this board goes...well...see the first part of thissentence...its hard to have a discussion with one's self.                     SticksIf someone posts an application, and says theyhave nothing to contribute to the family, whyshould they be bitten? I don't care if you knowthem irl. I know we can be picky. And I know that beingpicky means less members, but, if they aren'tquality people who are honest and have "something to contribute", why in the hell shouldANY of US bite THEM.Just My thoughts,   Tifacall this old vampire xenophobic, but No no no no no!Their notes are sub-standard, lack of thought and theyhave nothing to offer us.  Biting them would be a complete waste of a bite.  I am disappointed thatanother family member would bite them and not evenconsider mentioning it at all on our board, thoughnot a hard rule it's considered considerate.The Loner -SolitareThere have been some excellent notes posted recently about theprospects interviewed, the mechanics and theories of admission, thephilosophies of selection and communication in general as well. Iwanted to just say this is at least as close to perfect as I've seenthe boards work in a long, long time.@Saphria - That took some serious character and depth of perceptionto post your note and you should be commended for it. If there hadever even been any doubt in anyone's mind about whether you were anexcellent selection for the Family, it should be erased, banished,buried and forever forgotten. Well Done!@Tifa - Shiny.@Treebeard - Boy, I sah, Boy, you had better be a-listenin' to mewhen I'm a-talkin' to you, Boy.Hottentot - The Vampire Shining One**Clan for Family(hades, Oct  9, 2006):**i have taken the time and funds to make a clan for all Family who wish to be part of it i have addeda healing spell too and set the clan hall right out side the guild all where the applicants board is the name of the clan is the Lasombraif you are interested please mud mail me and let me know Sincerly yoursHades **Date Fix(vital, Oct 11 2007):**Sorry about the years not showing up correctly. I fixed it andthey should all be 2007 by now.--Vital**"
