messages "updates (Illarion Silvercloak):**I'm making a few updates to the guild.  Please mudmail me with anyissues.If you don't hear back within a sane amount of time, bug Fred.Illarion[Jan 19 2014 20:26]**Suggesting New Abilities (Illarion Silvercloak):**Please post suggestions regarding new abilities and ability updates onthis board.  Keep the following guidelines in mind:1.  Be specific.  Name a particular ability, and how it should bechanged, or in the case of a new ability, what it should do.2.  Be thematic.  Abilities will only be added if they fit the guildtheme.3.  Be creative.  This is especially important if another guild alreadyhas the ability.  Describe how the vampire version will be different.I may remove notes if the board gets too full, but all suggestions willbe recorded and considered.[Jan 19 2014 22:52]**"
