messages "Vampire Business(eurale, Aug 17, 100):**Our guild is one of mystery.  Do not share any vampire business with thosefrom the outside.  What is on our board, our spells and even our abilitesare our business and should be kept that way.  I don't want to know aboutwhat other guilds have and I don't want them comparing themselves to usby using info that they should NOT have.**Tours(eurale, Aug 17, 100):**A guild tour is a requirement.  If a prospective member is about to join thefamily, they should be prepared to take a tour.  I do not expect you bite ina new member and then leave, or have them leave, so they do not get a tour.If arrangements cannot be made for them to take a tour when they are inducted,do NOT bite them.  Wait for a later time.  I want whoever gives the tour toa new member to mail me that they have done so.**App Process(Aug  2, 2000):**I am getting VERY tired of hearing about people who are trying to 'get around'our application process.  So, here's the way it will be done:  the applicantwill post, we'll all wait 4 full days before anyone bites so that everyonecan read the posts, then the biting may begin.  If I catch anyone elsebiting before a post or before the time frame has elapsed, they will losetheir ability to bite permanently.  If that doesn't work, I willassign biters and ONLY they will be able to bite.  I want this crap stopped!**Vampire Guild(Dec  9, 2000):**I spent many hours thinking through this new version of the vampires andI've incorporated all the abilities you need to be successful playing Nirvanabe it PK or not.  If you find you cannot enjoy being a vampire becausesome other guild has something we do not, then it's probably time for youto explore becoming one of them and leaving my family.  I stretched thelimits of guild powers when I coded us and we are still just as strong asany other guild.**Kid Fangs(eurale, Jul 30):**I made a couple of changes to the kid fangs so that they are visible.  If you havekids in the vampire guild hall, they should be wearing their fangs or they are fairgame to any vampire.  No excuses.**Vampire Titles(eurale, Aug 24):**If you have attained a level of +30 and would like a custom vampire title, mail mewith your request and I'll consider coding it into the titles room.  Please rememberthat your title should vampire related and not offensive.  I will, of course, retainthe right to refuse to code any and all titles I find to be 'not in theme.'**Librarian(eurale, Sep 17):**I have added something to the vampire librarian.  After you bite in a new familymember, whoever gives the tour should go there and follow her directions to recordyour tour.  I will expect this to be done at the same time as the biting.  I thinkthis will add something to our history.**Biting New Members(eurale, Jul  5):**With exp so easy to get here, I've made changes to the biting code.  Please read'vhelp bite' and also 'vhelp demon' so you don't have any questions.**Coffin Storage(May 25, 2004):**Be sure to remember the 'exact' names that you called things when youstored them in your coffins lest you not be able to retrieve them at alater date.**Changes coming(Apr 27, 2006):**I'm told there are going to be some changes to our guild.  I don'thave much info yet so I can't tell you much but as soon as I do, I'lllet you know.  These changes may be beyond my control so just beaware of that fact.  I'll keep you posted....**"
