messages "Vampire Applicants(magus, Jun 17, 2000):**Give your note some thought.  We want to know why you desire to join usand what you bring to our family.  We care not about your current statsbut more about who you are.  Many have been rejected because their notedid not ring true to our ears....**Vampire Applicants(alexis, Jul 14 2009):**To all those who seek to join our Family:Once you have posted your application note, please seek us out andspeak with us.  We wish to know you, and to permit you theopportunity to learn more of us.  Please be patient with the process, as we are bound by the rules of our Family to offer nobody thebite of immortality until at least the third day after their applicationis posted.  Good luck, and may the dawn find you safely home.**minion(minion, May 24 2015):**I would like to join your guild. I know how selective your guild is but I have nothing other than family to offer. I hope you take my note and find it sincere. There are not many on here as far as players. I feel that being a Vampire is a life of obscurity and loneliness. Yet in a family setting I am down for whatever task(s) that need to be forfilled. Let me know, untill then I will search you all out. Thank you for your consideration... Oh and Bedo Bedo Bedo Bedo...Banana**Greetings(spam, Dec 18 2016):**Obsession. That's what has always driven me. My family didn't understand the obsession I had with life. They didn't understand that in order to fully comprehend life, that I had to spend many years studying death.That is what drew me towards Vampires. I have heard the folktales and murmurmings at the Village Green, but I need to experience it all myself.Life and death is what Vampires know best. They had to die in order to have life eternal. Immortality. What else could I learn and discover by being immortal?The idea of spending hundreds of years studying life and death as a Vampire is very appealing to me. I can wait and bide my time, because what is time once I am immortal?**"
