coffin_description "This is a long Slender black coffin made of solid onyx. The coffin is lined with a deep crimson silk with rivets of gold that hold it in place. The smooth onyx top has small chains and spikes arranged around the inside of it as if it was some kind of torture chamber. Dried blood seems to be all over the inside. Small spots are carved into the sides of the coffin. Placed in those spots are small trinkets such as small rings and knives. Speakers are pushed into the side of the coffin next to the silk crimson pillow. They seem to be emitting some crazy sadistic music. The Bottom of the coffin is lined with nails. Seems like someone who lives in this coffin rather enjoys pain."
