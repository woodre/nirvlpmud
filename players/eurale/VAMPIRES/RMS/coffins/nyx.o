coffin_description "The walls of the coffin are lined with full, draped folds of bloodred silk.  The scent of the fresh earth mixes with jasmine andoranges to fill the senses.  Miniature carvings of fanciful creatures hewn from ancient bones sit upon the shelf.  The earth shows curvedindentations where someone has been sleeping."
