coffin_description "The inside of the coffins lid is padded with purple satin and affixed with tiny silver tacks, Upon closer inspection you notice the tack heads are wolf-shaped. Positioned in the center of the lid is a plaque carved from Black Onyx and Inscribed with Silver lettering which reads: "Bloodson to Magus, Cricket & Ensco, May I always be worthy of their trust." In the far corner you notice a lifesize statue of a wolf. The detail is unnervingly realistic. The eyes seem to follow your every move."
