coffin_description "This is the shrine where the Shikon jewel rest under the protection of Kikio, high priestress of this shrine. At the back of the room sits a low alter with incense burning on both ends. In the center is a bowl for donations to the Gods. On the floor in front of the alter is a small grass mat for kneeling on while in prayer.The walls are covered with a morale of dragons and Samurai knighting and nijas creeping around in the dark. There are small pillows along one side wall for Kikio to spread out to sleep on.This is a quiet, dark place for Kikio to pray and mediate on the coming darkness for she prefers the quiet of this shirne to busy areas of the world."
