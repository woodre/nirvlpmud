coffin_description "This is the home of the vampiress Willow. Blood red satin adornsthe walls giving the room a sense of warmth. At the head of thecoffin lays an overstuffed black satin pillow, just right forlong daytime napes. For a small space it seems unusually spacious.Almost as if it were built for two to rest here instead of justone."
