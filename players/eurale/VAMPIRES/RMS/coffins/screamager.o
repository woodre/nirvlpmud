coffin_description "Sweeping sheets of red and black silks line the ceiling and walls of the coffin, their folds falling into deep shadow by the light of several ornate silver candlesticks.You notice Screamager's shimmering ebony cloak hanging from a dismembered hand on the south facing wall, and his bat-headed cane standing proudly in the hollowed out leg of an elven princess.  The room is dominated by a large 4 poster bed, sheeted in black and with a crimson rose lying on the centre pillows.  Delicate weblike drapes hang between each of the posts."
