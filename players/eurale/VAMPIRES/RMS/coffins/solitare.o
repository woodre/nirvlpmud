coffin_description "Deep shadows paint this room in gloom.  A few well positioned globesfloating about provide a bare illumination here.  A Wraithbone setof shelves contain various scrolls and book written in the eldar tongue.  On the far wall sit a elaborate altar that is stainedwith blood, and a pair of rusted manacles hang lazily over the side and sofly sway even though there is no wind here.  Next to thealtar sits a small table that holds many razor sharp knives, scalpels, and barbed wire.  A small cistern in the floor sitsnear the altar to carry any excess blood that may spill on to the floor.  A short distance away sits a double oval shapedbed that floats a few feet from the floor, though there isno means of holding it in the air, it still remains where itis even when weight is applied to it. This is the sanctum ofthe harlequin known only as The Solitare."
