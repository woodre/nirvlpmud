coffin_description "As you step into Alexis's coffin, a sense of profound peace overcomes you.  The darkness embraces you likethe warm, comforting arms of a lover.  The muted melody of new age music tenderly caresses your ears, soothingwithout being distracting, and the faint scent of jasmine tickles your nose as it carried past on the back of a lazy breeze.  In the far corner of the room stands a tall four-poster bed in deepest cherry wood, its translucent blacklace canopy billowing softly above the thick black comfortor which conceals snowy white linen sheets.  On theopposite wall stands a tidy coal-burning stove painted deepest matte black, sufficient to heat the far corners ofthe room in even the coldest of times.  Before the coal-burning stove sits an overstuffed couch covered in softkid-glove leather of deepest ebony.  Framing and completing the room are ceiling-high cherry bookshelves whichare neatly crammed with countless dusty tomes which seem to beckon to you."
