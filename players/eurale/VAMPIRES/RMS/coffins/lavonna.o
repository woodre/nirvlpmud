coffin_description "A Mother's LoveTo be forever nuzzled in the voluptuous bosom of Night.To be snuggled in Her gossamer blanket of ecstasy.To feel Her soft touch again.Oh, what heavenly bliss that would be.If only it was a possibility.I see Her now, standing in all of Her magnificence.Her hand is reaching for me as to say, "Come unto Thee, my child."My hand taking Her's, whispering, "Mother, I'm coming home."As She takes me into Her embrace, She whispered."For with Thee, thou shalt always have sanctuary."Oh Mother, dear sweet Mother, if only it could be as such. With great sadness in my heart, I know it cannot be.I wish not to say 'adieu' to Thee but I must.It is time for me to return to the harsh realities of humanity.Fare Thee well Mother and, remember, I shalt always love Thee.Josephine PerrielloCopyright 2001 Josephine Perriellohttp://www.poetry.com"
