coffin_description "   As the lid of the coffin closes, the floor slides away revealing a stone staircase.  Following the stairs downward, you find yourself in a large parlor ornately decorated in dark, rich mahogany and walnut.  The masterfully-crafted, dark walnut hardwood floor is inlaid with the image of a beautiful rose in full bloom.  Three of the walls are covered in rich, dark reddish-brown mahogany panelling intricately carved with ornate boiseries and decorated with shimmering gold gilding. Several tapestries detailed in lush reds, golds and greens adorn these walls.  The far wall is made entirely of granite with a large fireplace carved into its face, a cozy fire crackling within.  Next to the fireplace sits a very large canopy bed surrounded by luxurious, blood-red curtains, its thick, sturdy ebony frame finely decorated with intricate gold inlay.  A large reddish-brown walnut steamer trunk with black metal bands sits at the foot of the bed locked with a sturdy padlock.  In front of the stone fireplace lies a thick burgandy rug framed by a pair of plush dark brown leather high back wing chairs.  Looking up, you notice a small iron ring mounted in the center of the solid stone ceiling."
