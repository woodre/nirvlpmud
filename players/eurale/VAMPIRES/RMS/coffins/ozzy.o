coffin_description "As you enter your clothes disappear, modesty is not allowed here.The mirrored ceiling reflects the glow of candles surrounding Ozzy's bed.The Roman style bath is filled with warm blood, it is just as (if not more) inviting than the bed.Soft Celtic musicplays softly, as if heard from far away.Your footsteps make no sound, you look down and see a thick black carpet.Only now do you scent the fresh lylics from the vases lining the walls.Also you notice a shelf with urns, former loved one? fallen enemies? or one and the same?And last you see Ozzy, fangs exposed and coming for you!"
