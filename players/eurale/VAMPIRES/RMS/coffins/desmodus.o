coffin_description "%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% - Welcome to Desmodus' Abode - %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%This coffin certainly looked smaller from the outside...       The walls are painted a pleasing shade of blue and they are coveredwith stars that mimic the night sky.  Candles in brass wall sconces castlight on oak furnature.  Gargoyles leer from wooden shelves as shadowsdance behind them.  A pot of tea brews merrily on the stove and the scent of insence warms the soul.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%"
