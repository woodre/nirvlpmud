  vemove <who>    There have been times in the past when family       *
                  members have been deemed to be out of line for
                  various reasons.  This command allows the caster
                  to remove another member's fangs until the issues
                  are resolved.  Authority to use this command is
                  granted only by the guild wizard.  See:  veplace
