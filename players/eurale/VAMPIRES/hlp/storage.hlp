  ~o~  Vampire Coffin Storage  ~o~
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Every vampire has the option of buying storage space in their coffins.  The
cost is $40,000 gold coins for the ability to store up to 3 items.  The coffin
commands to use the storage you buy are:

	store <name> - stores the item if it's storable.
	retrieve <name> - gets the item out of storage.
	list - lists all the items you currently have in storage.
