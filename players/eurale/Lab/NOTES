  This is a fairly high level area.  It will take some better than average
exploration skills to get through it.  Most of the monsters are level 19 or
higher with higher WC than the monster chart.  All the monsters have items
that can be bartered with either Madame Rue or my newest tradesman, Sedjak.
There are a couple of items of interest:
  ~/Lab/OBJ/tadji.c - this wc16 dagger does not dull and has specials akin
                      to the Sword of Spirits and Pearl Handled Broadsword.
                      Players must kill to get to it (3 large mobs) and risk
                      being burned by acid (autoload object) that does
                      continual damage until removed.
  ~/Lab/OBJ/shadowscale - this armor replaces the std game say with bold
                      'hissing' says.  Other than that, it is std.

There are a number of mobs that poison the player in some way and I've made
all of them curable with items that I've had in the game for ages (ie. the
tempstick to detect their ailment and the dmso to get rid of it).

There are also 2 other objects not in this directory.  They are ~/RMS/barter
and ~/NPC/sedjak which are the room and npc the players will need to barter
the treasure they get from this area.  Sedjak is killable and I suspect that
other players will kill him to keep others from bartering their goods.  I'll
log that to keep an eye on it.
