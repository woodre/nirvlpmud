   Sun Apr 11 14:11:25 1999     Checked out catwoman's new identifying ball and wrote to seniors about it.

   Wed Apr 14 15:32:28 1999     Discussed the vamp 'grasp' spell and changed it as per his instructions.  Apparently there was some concern about its effectiveness.

   Mon Apr 19 20:33:46 1999     Making headway in recoding the entire vampire guild, abeit slowly.

   Tue Apr 20 20:46:25 1999     Set up a filer for Dragnar so he could log important stuff like we all do... yippee.

   Wed Apr 21 20:56:27 1999     Talked to mythos about guild stuff and changes the vamp heals to conform to mud rules and also allow anyone to use them.

   Thu Apr 22 21:49:50 1999     Made some serious headway tonight.  Feeling good and leaving on a high note. :)

   Thu Apr 22 21:50:32 1999     Talked to Dragnar about changes to his wastelands.  Sounds like too much to do so he's going to shut down, make changes, and get reapproval before reopening.

   Mon Apr 26 10:47:15 1999     Changes /players/saber/stuff/darkey.c to value 0.

   Tue Apr 27 21:48:12 1999     Sponsored Maledicta and wished him the customary 'good luck'.

   Wed Apr 28 17:08:16 1999     Copied some of my files into Maledicta's dir so he could have a look at them.  All std stuff.

   Sat May  1 08:48:03 1999     Worked on updating most of my files...  This is going to take a while I'm afraid.

   Mon May  3 19:19:20 1999     Did final walkthrough on Zeus's area.  Helped him set his castle up.  Wrote to Boltar about adding it to init in a different location (room/giant_path). Promoted Zeus to level 30 for his efforts.

   Mon May  3 19:20:10 1999     Wrote to Seniors about going through the guild changes.  I'm very comfortable that the changes have been reasonable and will make the vampire guild a much more challenging guild.

   Tue May  4 13:08:03 1999     Worked at straightening up the files in ~/Keep.  Almost done.

   Wed May  5 12:02:32 1999     Gave Katya 30k coins to buy another safe after the crashed goofed hers up and I dested it.

   Wed May  5 14:03:22 1999     Checked through the Vampire trials... they will certainly be a challenge compared to the old tasks....  I like the way they turned out.

   Fri May  7 11:41:51 1999     Redid my ~/Sable area to make it so that every monsters wasn't called the same thing.  It was terrible.

   Fri May  7 12:59:42 1999     Organized the files in ~/Hotel so they were uniform.

   Fri May  7 19:32:05 1999     Went through ~/Drygulch and cleaned up all the files.  Beginning to make some headway on my stuff.  :)

   Sun May  9 20:33:28 1999     Tentatively approved ~/wocket/std/orb.c for game play.  Teleport objects still make me nervous, however.

   Thu May 13 11:13:36 1999     Added item limits to more items sold in the glade.  I agree with Snow that there shouldn't be unlimited suppies of every item.

   Thu May 13 11:14:42 1999     Changes ~/Glade/NPC/rue.c so that she can 'barter' for more items.  I will slowly change all my 'unique' items over to this system.  Also made a 'template' for others to use if they choose to go this new direction.

   Fri May 28 20:04:43 1999     Caught Minus multiplaying... made him forfeit the coins and gear he passed to Stardream to get as his second.  He said SD didn't know they were both him and she indicated the same as I talked to her first.

   Wed Jun  2 06:57:08 1999     Talked to Trix & Francesco about helping players as wizzes. Fran's part was overblown.  Demoted Trix 10 levels for his part and he assured me it wouldn't happen again.

   Mon Jun  7 16:29:50 1999     Happily promoted maledicta to level 40 today for his efforts to date.

   Wed Jun  9 19:04:06 1999     Zeus whined about dying because his server didn't DC him fast enough.  He was going to 'restore' his lost exp from his death.  I told him no but he wanted to argue and bring in other cases.  I'm not happy about this.

   Wed Jun  9 19:12:58 1999     Finished updating all my ~/eurale/Dis files.

   Thu Jun 10 16:22:34 1999     Rearranged files in ~/eurale/Fiend for standardization.  Also modified the price of my ~/eurale/Drygulch/OBJ/tea, jerky, rotgot to conform to /doc/build/RULES/heals3.

   Mon Jun 14 20:06:16 1999     Changed ~/VAMPIRES/lib/shift_hp to lose some random hps when shifting.

   Wed Jun 16 13:19:57 1999     Commented out the game 'emote' of ~/catt/WPN/hammerdest.c since it was not done on appropropriate channel and was being used to spam the game. (by larisa)

   Thu Jul  8 16:35:25 1999     Hopefully repaired ~/Space/Xorn from errors.  We'll see.. :)

   Sat Jul 10 20:34:37 1999     Added a light variable to ~/saber/stuff/etorch.c so it couldn't

   Sat Jul 10 21:23:59 1999     Added check so only one tome/scroll could be gotten from ~/saber/monsters/bardman as they were being abused.

   Sun Jul 11 17:32:00 1999     Changed the vending machine in Trix's to indicate 'sold out' scanners until I hear otherwise.  Mythos removed them as they appeared to be illegal.

   Sun Jul 18 11:29:05 1999     Continued to repair 'problems' caused by moving all my old vamp files into a 'common' directory.  Updated things as I went as well.

   Mon Aug  9 21:51:23 1999     Made a 'minor' change in Nooneelse's tuxedo since nobody is supposed to still have one.  Of course, the change was lower :)  (easier than arguing)

   Mon Aug  9 22:07:01 1999     Added code to ~/pathfinder/detroit/items/button.c so that only 1 could be given to a player... was being used to spam player inventories.

   Wed Aug 11 20:47:02 1999     Watched I tell M and Z that he had other players passwords.  Not a good situation

   Sat Aug 14 07:48:32 1999     Went through ~/zeus/heals/zp1,2,3 and they looked to be okay.  I am not sure of the pricing structure but it mirrors others already in play so....

   Wed Aug 18 09:23:06 1999     Changed ~/daranath/qualtor/obj/sandles.c value so that they sold for less than they bought for.... another money maker.

   Wed Aug 18 23:05:13 1999     Larisa had a mail problem but I couldn't locate the mail files so...

   Tue Oct  5 19:50:36 1999     Took the 'paladin guild' exit out of molasar's room /molasar/rowan/w_twn_sq.c so players didn't keep asking about it.

   Wed Oct  6 11:12:17 1999     Checked out a spell complaint from Ensco (testor) but found it was his lack of reading, not a code problem.

   Wed Oct  6 11:33:34 1999     Closed off Molasar's Rowan area again as per Boltar's instructions.  Boltar mailed Molasar.
