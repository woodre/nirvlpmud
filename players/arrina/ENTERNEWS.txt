Ok, polymorphs...in the interest of having this guild be a bit more
in line with the rest of the mud's guilds, the exp needed to get
guild levels has been increased fourfold, and the penalty for quitting
is now a loss of 4/5 of your exp. This guild is not here so people can
join and get exp easily, then quit to join another guild.
