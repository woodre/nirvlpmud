I've set forth a plan... witches.doc if you wanna take a look

Hmm...I having an odd reaction, which I don't quite know how to explain.
I really want to be supportive of your creative thoughts.  But, my reaction
to witches.doc was predominantly negative.  In fact, almost entirely negative.
To begin with, the name.  Witches are generally considered to be female.  Witches
are usually old hags who generally act nasty for no particular reason so that
storytellers would have an easily recognized villain.  Alternatively, the term
'witch' is typically ascribed to followers of the wiccan faith.  Very rarely
in modern fantasy literature are general practitioners of magic described as
witches.  Either way, naming a guild 'witches' is carrying a whole lot of other
stuff that we probably don't want to associate with a guild.
Nextily, I don't like the idea of further restricting our spell list, especially
in such a drastic manner.  We already have enough drawbacks to our guild
to allow for a wide spell list.  
Otherwise, this looks like a total restatement of what we had planned for sorcerers.
