Witches v2.0 -


Theme -
	A spell casting guild, concentrating on magical damage as
opposed the physical damage.  Spells are learned as one travels 
through the land so experience will never be 'robbed' from the player.
But also players must have a certain ammount of experience before they
can learn to comprehend complex magical spells.  Once learned however
they are not forgotten through death.
Because magic is being used as a form of destruction spells of creation
are never learned.  For example:  A player might summon a pre created
monster to serve their purposes but never raise the dead or bring life
to a creature.  Also a player might steal life from another living
object but will never be able to heal straight out.

Objectives -
	A player enters the guild when another player binds a spellbook
for them.  A player then must seek out npcs (possibly player) to train
them in certain spells.  Players must have an min exp ammount to learn
a spell as well as a min number of practice points in a certain 
type of magic ie. evocation, illusion, sorcery, etc...
Exp amounts are not shown to player nor are practice points.

	Because allowing a new member to join the guild costs a lot,
hopefully this will slow members joining and get rid of a lot of
the trouble makers.  People wont be willing to let just anyone in
if it will cost them a lot.  Hopefully what monsters teach what, will
be keep somewhat of a secret.  Also with this method new spells can
be added with ease.  No one can ever max the guild out because no
one will ever know if they have every spell. 

	A player will receive a "book of shadows" at which they
can make their own personal notes in as well as where they write their
gained spells.  Help files will be limited allowing the players to
write their own.

	Witches are not a very strong attack guild but very effective
as a secondary party member.  Hopefully parties will be encouraged
gaining more for the mud as a whole.

Advantages -
	Spells do more then suggested damage.
	Witches automatically gain 2 sp a round.
	No exp costs for spells.

Disadvantages -
	No casting a spell while wielding a weapon.
	No casting a spell while wearing armor.
	No casting a spell in the dark.
        No wimpy
        Lower max stamina
        Lower max strength
        A lot of the commands are blocked and either redone
        with in the guild or removed completely.
