This area is based upon the movie Dark City which was based upon
a story by Alex Proyas.
Dark City is a huge research laboratory adrift in space
where aliens called 'strangers' twist reality and the
memories of their human lab rats in order to better undertand
the human soul which they lack.  The strangers have the ability
to 'tune', what they call their method of warping reality
to suit their needs.  John Murdoch, a man who was to be
implanted with the memories of a serial killer, resisted the
process and began exhibiting the strangers' ability to tune.

This area takes places at roughly the beginning of the movie
a few minutes after John wakes up, with a few minor differences
regarding everybody else's exact location.  For example,
Dr. Schreber isn't outside on the street, he's in the pool
beneath his office building where he seemed to spend most
of his time.  Bumstead isn't at home playing his accordian,
he's in his office at the police station, etc.
