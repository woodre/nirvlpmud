**  3. The tourney will be conducted in the following manner:       **
**        Players will be assigned opponents by the Tournament's    **

**  4. Approximately 5,000 coins worth of heals may be taken into   **
**     each fight.  The arbiter may assign a handicap to this       **
**     ammount if the two combatants are of different power levels. **

**              to enforce the rules of the tournament as he or     **
**              she sees fit, and may punish anyone who cheats in   **
**              the tournament by anything from disqualification    **
**              from the current tournament, to one or more deaths  **
**              depending upon the severity of the crime.           **
**                                                                  **
