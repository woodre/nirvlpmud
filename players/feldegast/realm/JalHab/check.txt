These items require special attention in approval:

Heals:
~/heals/myrm-blood.c
~/heals/myrm-heart.c
	These heals heal 20/60 and 80/20, and are calculated as an
average of the hp/sp.  There is a 1/9 chance of random(60) damage.
These must be fought for rather than purchased.

stemple.c - A temple w/blessing.  The blessing is basicly a slow
	regeneration spell that only works during combat.  See
	~/heals/blessing.c for details.  This item has a cost/heal
	ratio of 45 rather than 60 due to the slowness of the
	regeneration, the remoteness of the location, the fact that
	the heal only occurs during combat, and due to the sheer
	improbability that players will actually use it.  I don't
	see how this could really be abused at the current rate, and
	I think it is a more thematic method of healing.

Monsters:
~/mon/cactipod.c
	This monster has a 50% chance of leaving behind a 1200 coin
heal, or producing 1+random(3) copies of itself.  This may sound like
there will be hoards of cactipods wandering around the desert, but
in practice there are rarely more than 4 generated.

~/mon/jikhal.c
	This was around the third of fourth monster that I made for
this mud, but he has some nifty abilities.  He has a decent weapon and
an ac4 armor.

~/mon/valatia.c
	Another monster with some special abilities.  She has the
crystal ball listed below.

Equipment:
~/equip/wandereye.c
	A powerful artifact that's on ~/mon/wanderer.c.  It has a few
abilities for navigating the desert, can be used to slowly regenerate,
and can be used to teleport using standard teleportation rules to the
Jal-Hab.  Uses charges.  

~/equip/ghelm.c
	A golden helm.  Sold in limited quantities in a store for 8000
coins.  There is a 1/6 chance of 6hp damage.  Not a practical item,
but it is just sick and twisted enough to amuse me.

Clothing:
This is a new item type that I'm experimenting with.
~/realm/JalHab/stailor.c - A tailor shop.
~/std/clothes.c - The objects in a group.
~/std/clothing.c - An individual piece.
The basic idea is that the player buys a piece of clothing, and it
becomes something that they permanently wear and appears in their
long description.  They can remove these items, drop them, and they
will become an individual piece of clothing.  The clothes simply have
a cosmetic appearance and have no real game effect.  If this is
popular, then I'd like to make it available to other wizards.  If it
isn't, then I'll probably stop it from autoloading and forget about it.
I think players will either really like this idea, or totally ignore
it.

Misc:
~/obj/scroll-escape.c
Teleports the player to a random location using TELE_ERR.  There are
random(5) of these sold in the magic shop for 2500 coins per reboot.  

~/realm/JalHab/stav6.c
This is a casino with a blackjack game.  The pot is 2000 coins.


~/obj/crystal.c
This is a crystal ball on ~/mon/valatia.c, a "special" monster with a
number of combat abilities.  Can be used to view another player's room,
chance of detection, and to see a player's description(similar to the
old bard history command).

In addition, I have written an outline of the area, in 
~/realm/JalHab/outline.txt which you can look over and tell me if you
think everything else is good.
