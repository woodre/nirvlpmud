PicarYeah, there was a three way tie.  We ran (so to speak) into overtime andreboot hit(Yes, we started a little after 8pm, so it was over three hourslong) so a tie was called.  We may have to codify this in the future so thatplayers have less incentive to drag it out, but until then, I decided to justlet them split 1st prize 3 ways.Feldegast**Sun Jan  3 10:11:30 1999 Tournament '99(Feldegast):**Here're the rankings for the first tournament of 1999.  Sorry Ididn't get these up last night.  I blame the isp gremlins.10. Imperial (Ghost)9. Silence (Vartanian)8. James (Ghost)7. Eevee (Ghost)6. Sticks (Ghost/Avis) ?!5. Weasel (Ghost)4. Ghost (Avis)3. Kezef (Avis)2. Vartanian (Avis)1. AvisIn addition to the usual 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place prizes, I alsoawarded Ghost a prize for doing such a good job.The next tournament will be held on a Thursday, because I knowsome people can't always make it on Saturdays.  So, the nextone will be on Thursday, January 7 at 7pm Eastern Standard Time.I've been asking around about people's thoughts regarding a teamtourney.  (Of course, by some accounts, this WAS a team tourney).What do you guys think?  Send me your thoughts via mudmail, abouta) team size  b) victory conditions  c) arena size/dimensionsWe can do alot with this kinda set-up.  Maybe set up camps, or makecastles/forts that each team has to defend.  Play a game of capturethe flag, or who knows what.  Let me know what YOU think.Feldegast**Fri Jan  8 00:44:02 1999 Tournament '99 II(Feldegast):**Here are the results of this tournament:7. Pan (Sticks) 6. Berlinetta (Vartanian)5. Abel (Vartanian)4. Demando (Zephyra)3. Zephyra (Vartanian)2. Sticks (Vartanian)1. VartanianWell, it seems holding a midweek tournament didn't get enough of ashowing, so we will be sticking with the Saturday timeslot.The next tournament will be Saturday, January 16, 1999 at 8pm EST.Feldegast**Sun Jan 17 20:51:52 1999 Tournament '99 III(Feldegast):**Here are the results of tonight's tournament:11.

Bannock (Roland)1. RolandThis tournament went pretty well despite it being postponed from Saturdayto Sunday due to the mud being down and a few mysterious sensitivemind errors. (I have not forgotten them.  If anybody made any logs of thetourney and caught some errors, mail them to casmith@naur.csee.wvu.eduand I will try to figure them out.)  There was also some lag, andregretably, a few people had to be disqualified for disconnecting.I'd just like to remind everybody that it is important to log back inimmediately if you are disconnected.  Anyway...Good job people.  The nexttourney will be on Saturday.  Look forward to seeing you all there.Feldegast**Sat Jan 23 21:17:49 1999 Tournament '99 IV(Feldegast):**Rankings:--------12.

Usagi (Burn)1. Burn  This tourney actually went fairly well, with very few bugs.  Of course,some people might mention that a couple of players spontaneously cameback to life, but because this is the first time that this problem hascropped up, and there has only been one major change in the tournamentcode, I will have to conclude that this is some other wizard's mess. :)As for that one major change, it is now more difficult to retreat fromcombat.  Although a few players rightfully complained about my notwarning them(I made the change earlier, and forgot all about it), mostpeople felt it improved gameplay overall, and so it will be left in.Once again, good game everybody, and I look forward to seeing you allat the next tournament.  Same day, same place, same time.Feldegastp.s. I WILL be looking into the few bugs that came up, don't worry.**Sat Jan 30 20:38:53 1999 Tournament '99 V(Feldegast):**Results:-------12.

Let me make it clear once again: Using any spell to avoid damageor any spell which takes you out of the bounds of the arena is ILLEGAL.The same goes for resurrect spells.  I know I haven't made this clear inthe past, but I hope that I am doing so now.  I have tried to block thesecommands, but I cannot know the entire spell list of every single guild.Sorry if I'm ranting a bit, the tourney went VERY well other than thatminor problem.  Toodles, all, and I hope to see you here next weekend.Feldegast**Sat Mar  6 21:29:42 1999 Tournament '99 VIII(Feldegast):**Results:-------9. Lolo (Weasel)8. Jaraxle (Weasel)7.

You could have thematches set out and have each of the winners move on to the nextround.. you know how it goes ;) That may be a bit more of a testthen just seeing who has a bigger group.**Sun Mar 14 12:42:41 1999 Agreement(Justin):**I like Larisa's idea because it seems whoever has the biggest group alwayswins in these and that way it would be a 1 on 1 type deal to be the best.  Theonly thing is that would take alot of planning to match players up with skilllevel and such.Other than that I love her idea.-Justin-**Sun Mar 14 12:50:47 1999 Tournament '99 IX(Feldegast):**Results:-------13.

Konya (Vampira)2. Vampira (Burn)1. BurnI'd just like to thank Wocket for supervising this tournament for mesince I couldn't be there.  He did a great job, and I appreciate himcovering for me.On another note, I think doing a few one-on-one tournaments for fun mightbe interesting, but I don't think we'd be switching over to do that ona permanent basis.  If I get the time(which I haven't had lately) I willtry to put something together.Feldegastp.s. This board is acting a little fritzy right now, and the heading infomight be a little incorrect if you post.  Again, I will try to fix it soon.**Fri Mar 19 00:56:23 1999 one on one(Francesco):**one on one tournie could be organized like a tennis tournament: first round will be picked on randomly, the next will be automatically set after two players are killed their previous enemies.my two centsfran**Sat Mar 20 21:40:42 1999 Tournament '99 X(Feldegast):**Rankings:--------7.

Sting (Sting)2. Vertebraker (Armblessed)1. ArmblessedThis tourney went so fast, I practically blinked and it was over.  However,it brought up a few issues which I will mention here.  First of all, anothervampire used a spell to exit and re-enter the tournament arena.  As I havementioned in the past, and as is written in the rules written on theplaque in arena central, using an ability to leave the arena and avoidcombat is illegal and you will be disqualified for using it.  Frankly,it'd be a pretty lame tourney if everybody just hid in their own littlepocket dimensions.  I've tried to block most of the relevant commands, butobviously I missed one, which is why I have to disqualify the people whobreak it, so nobody does it again.The next issue is low attendance.  I can't give away kewl prizes when onlya few real contenders show up for a tourney.  If there's no challenge inwinning this stuff, then it devalues the prizes.  We will most likely nothave another tourney for a couple of weeks, since I think the novelty of having a tourney is wearing off.Yours truly,Feldegast**Sun Apr 11 01:44:35 1999 Tournament '99 XII(Feldegast):**Rankings:--------7. Panther (Picar)6. Bishop (Kazer)5. Kazer (Picar)4. Tassadar (Jenny)3. Picar (Konya)2. Pan (Jenny)1. KonyaTo be honest, this tournament was so unpleasant I'm almost hesitant topost the results.  Even before the tourney began, it was obvious thatthe guild with the most players on was going to win, and few players werewilling to enter because of this.  The tourney was short, unentertaining, andnot very fun for any of the participants.  We probably will not be holdinganother tournament without substantial changes to its format.The next bit of unpleasantness, was that I discovered after the tournamentthat a certain player who should have no need to cheat, snuck a full heal intothe tourney.  I have a wiztool to search through everybody's inventory priorto the tourney to make sure that everybody has complied with the rules forheals, but I have to tell it what to look for, and I miss a heal here andthere.  I hope that in the future it will not be necessary to punish anyonefor cheating over this tournament.  If you cannot play fairly, do notplay at all.Feldegast**Sun Oct 15 15:31:16 2000 Tournament XIII(Feldegast):**For this tournament, Vertebraker generously offered his services asreferee and performed quite well for his first time.  The scoring wasslightly different.  Instead of counting who survived the longest,the scoring was by levels worth of kills.   Name        Pts.   Kills-----------------------------------------1. Aelic        38    (Tsuyoi, Raesh)2. Calinor      38    (Aubergine, Jarana)3. Aubergine    19    (Kadabra)4. Tsuyoi       19    (Calinor)5. Jarana       13    (Kasia)6. Kadabra       07. Kasia         0Vertebraker decided to break the tie between Aelic and Calinor basedupon who survived longest(Aelic was the last survivor).  All otherties were decided by longevity or extralevels.  Congratz again toAelic for once again proving that an old dog can still bite.And now for the nasty stuff...There were a few problems with the heal limit.  Remember, detoxingheals are included in the total.  You may not bring in heals that arenot purchased.  And most importantly, if you are frustrated whilewaiting for the tourney to start, check your own inventory to makesure you aren't over the limit.Overall, this was a good tourney, and I think we can look forward tohaving more in the future.  Feldegast**Thu Feb  8 17:51:05 2001 Tournament IV(Feldegast):**  Unfortunately, I forgot about the scoring system that we used lasttime, which worked out much better.  If I remember next time, we'llgo back to scoring by who killed most.Rnk Name        Killed by-----------------------------------------8.  Arrow       Vendetta7.  Tarken      Tycho  6.
