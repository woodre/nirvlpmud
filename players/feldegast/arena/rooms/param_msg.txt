Current options are:
    -h       This option will enable arena heals so that
             the smaller fighter will automatically heal
             as much as the difference in hps between the
             two fighters during the fight.

    -b       This option will allow you to fight a bloodmatch
             instead of a fight to the death.  Whoever reaches
             80 hps or below first loses.  It is possible to
             have a tie.
             Note: This option is now the default. (11/11/98)

    -d       If you select this option, then the fight will be
             to the death and the loser will lose some experience.

    -n       This option will make the arena a null-magic area
             so that no spells may be cast.  This option only works
             for The Pit.

    -m1      Choose The Pit as the arena. (default)

    -m2      Choose Feldaria to be the arena.
