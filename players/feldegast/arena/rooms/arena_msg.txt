                               ___
To challenge another player, simply type 'challenge <player>' and
if they accept, you will enter the arena automatically.

Once you are in the arena, you may neither quit, nor leave until
your opponent has been defeated.  If you disconnect, you will have
60 seconds to reconnect, or you will lose the match.
NEW: Either player may type 'call tie' in the arena and if the other
player agrees, you will both be moved to the recovery room.
Note: Any losses of equipment or experience points will not be
      recompensated for any reason.  Entering the arena is strictly
      voluntary.
You may also use options in your challenge to change the nature
of the fight.  Type 'read parameters' for more information.


 Examples:
   challenge masakado
   challenge batarsis -h -b
