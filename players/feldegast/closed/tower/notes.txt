daredevil has a wvnvaxa account...wonder if i know him
In ~trix/quest/see10.c grid should be grating...There is no grid in the descrip and there's no way to guess 'search grid'.
Blah...Nevermind.
Cirra and Newgod are gf, bf irl, they use the same computer to play on here.
write_file requires this_player()...Or so it appears...
Change corpse to body in murdroom.c description...

It's okay to be the bride at a wedding, but try not to be the corpse at the funeral.
Worm's mud? :Halhinet.on.ca 1234
daredevil is jebuly's sister's boyfriend and sandmans brother
The language law on gossip is pointless if none of the wizzes follow it.
Kathryn@wvnvaxa.wvnet.edu
Not so sure about Jae/Goblin anymore...
Goblin was killed by the banshee and was afk while Jae rescued her corpse.
This wouldn't concern me, ...And gosh, it doesn't.
But anyway, they didn't communicate at all.
Nor did they attempt to communicate.
Mugzee is the father of Worm and Lsd.
Scratch that.
Beez is Worm and Lsd's dad.
Mugzee is Lsd's brother?
Lsd is/was Claw
Add an answer to 'pirates' and 'tears' in the storyteller.
fozzy=adrock
Gowron, Snow, Pain, and I were on when Lilia was killed.
Goblin and Posiden were killed by Alanna.
blaze=alia
Why do public service announcements always stress our similarities when we're really all different?
Who are you?
What do you want?
Possible multiplay - Bannock(134.129.239.201) and Budah(134.129.239.181).
Budah killed Bannock twice in my sparring arena.
Another possible: Hormal(207.115.248.80) and
Jediwalk(207.115.248.63)
Very weird...They kept typing the exact same thing at the same time, but not always.
Psychicly linked, perhaps?
Jediwalk dc'ed...
Hormal dc'ed a few minutes later.

Madbiker@ts01-62.cork.indigo.ie(194.125.146.189)
(gossip) Madbiker sticks his two fingers in his ass and makes it smile....
Next time he does that, remind me to toss his butt in prison.
I changed his int from 6 to 1 since he disconnected when I detained him.
bruno=massa
Notes on pk bug:
 1. The bug occurs when multiple mud spells are cast.
 2. The bug doesn't occur when both players have their pk set.
 3. Therefore, the error must be in something that checks pk, most likely valid_attack or attack.

Nostalgia?

zoloff@dialup17.elz-net1.eznet.net(207.50.134.187)
My descrips are too damn short.  I need to expand them.
Particularly in my jungle island area.
I bet it's Zmud.  It always makes what I'm typing look too long.

Check out possible bug in arena -- Double challenges.
The 6 attributes that attract players to an area are:
{ monsters, heals, armor, weapons, transportation, shops }
Trix - #10 6932
Hmm...Most ideas on the idea board are for guilds.
The wizard can have his own personal rooms, but the player cannot.  The wizard must be present for a player to be in a personal wizard room.  All wizard functions must be secure so the player cannot use them.
Mental note: Code a guild, you fucking moron.

From Mythos' mouth to my ears: consider the bards gone unless Saber himself comes back.
Just so I don't forget and ask again...
intp,floatp,stringp accept mixed, return 0,1
Also, closurep,mappingp,objectp
What's a closure tho?
tell_room(environment(TP),TPN+" does something mean.\n",({ TP->query_attack() }) );
to_int("1234blah") == 1234
Scratch that, undefined.
Nona's suggestion: female pk'er guild, amazons?  furies?  valkyries?

Ghost, Skan have rsvp'ed.
Mental note: Make sure 'shadows' is blocked.
Picar RSVP'ed
According to rumor, Medewsa has been passed around alot.
Tell Wocket Morphine/Cheyenne was asking for him.
Dazed=Worm=Mugzee
Smoke got Zephyra
Tournament notes:
1. Block feign death for knights
2. Fix the aggro prob with Jikhal
Hedron problem: Function kill not ofund.
Skan is helping Vital quest...but to what extent?
Block commands: weather, feign death, shadow, check out vampire healing command.
This is bullshit with players escaping the arena like this.
Log the lockers.
Prepare contingency monsters.
Prepare 'walls' for fencing players in.
Usagi was killed by the Hinotori, but he had Kezef get his corpse, then he didn't kill the hinotori, therefore he broke his oath.
Susie, newbie locker bug, Catwoman's pirate sword
The Galileo quest can be used to escape any no teleport zone.
Skan=Butch
Took a comlaint from Sacha about trying to climb the tree in the glade, dc'ing, then dying while still having 200hp.  My theory: He just wasn't paying attention and got took by surprise.  But I will note it anyway...
Another note, Sacha mentioned that combats sometimes continue when a player follows someone from a pk, to a non-pk area.
If I have some time, I should look into that.
Hrunthar, Level 18, 672
Fix 'awho' so it doesn't show people in central, or ghost.
Put in an obit notice in the central.

According to the sql query, Analrapist is either Aiden or Candy.
If I had to guess, I'd say that's more Candy's style.
sforst19 has a typo in it.
Make Lupus not attack wizzes.
Konya/company likes to spam Skan.
If I'm ever in need of a cheap, quick idea, recode the mudlevel titles, and let players change their titles to that.
Code an "adventurer's portal", with a cyclical destination to some cool, underused area.
Examine death gate.
Toss Rebel in prison, for shouting.
catwoman/city/17.c error going west
flies on shit....I can never remember that.
Get rid of the magi stone.
Grit=Mode and he claims to have access to prison logs.
Camayamaya
Budah thinks I act like a dick mostly.  Why is that?
Darkwater/Minus wants to be a sorcerer testchar.
You ARE being watched.
When push comes to shove, keep in mind that the only reason you're here is to make nifty shit, laugh, and have a good time.
de to deactivate mage spells 'de stone' 'de flame'.
Kazer lost a demon's bane after trying to save it in the hotel.
Suggestion #1: Do a check for removing notes in the advance hall, so only wizzes can remove notes.
Wraiths are pretty cool, don't you think?
Spell idea: snowstorm: snowballs accumulate.
objects: snowstorm.c snow.c snowball.c
Katrin, Goddess, Punkette: hawx2.downcity.net
Block the vamp mist spell in the tourney.
Make Mr. Book's wave do add_hit_point, not heal_self damage.
Check weights on my heals to be sure they're consistent.
Look into complaints about defensive modes.
Dread is recruiting players for another mud on here.
Who is Coren?
Stiggur is Tristian

Jenny is a guy.  Big surprise.
Atvar is a moron.
Damage, also offering positions on other muds.
Just wondering how common this is...
I failed...................................................................................................................................................................
Mirage(global.mactemps.com) is responsible for 'Nutstaine'.
Delta e-mail punkomatic@usa.net Wants some lpc samples or website addy.
Corpse catcher needed for the tourney.
Justin won the tourney.
Just because you CAN do something, doesn't mean that you should.  This is what separates man from the beasts.
Zeus is/was Dan...?
