Dear friends,
	I'm writing this note to let you all know that
I'll be taking a hiatus away from my wiz duties on
Nirvana for a couple of weeks.  A wiz that I respected
a great deal basicly used an idea that I'd told him I
was working on, and I'm not quite mature enough to thank
him for it.  So I'm gonna take a break to cool down for
a while and decide what direction I want to take myself
and my area in.  I also feel anywhere but here would be
a more creative environment, all things considered.  So,
I'll probably be back, but not until I have a good
reason.

Feldegast, Master of the Crystal Tower
