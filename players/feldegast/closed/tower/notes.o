messages "Monster Committee BBoard(feldegast):**This board is for members of the monster committee to post new ideason.Feldegast**Current ideas(feldegast):**Things to do:1. Fix monster chart2. Expand to level 303. Multiple hits/spells4. Resistance to damage types?5. Friend/foe identification6. Monster/Player exit blocking7. Standardized interaction funcs (an array for catch_tells, include func calling)8. Standardized shops/vendors9. Monster spell emotes using players namesPets:  Humanoid pets(intelligent, act on own)  base commands upon player's int, level  Get rid of generic pets!!!**monster exp(snow):**This might be a multi-topic thing but, what if monster exp was alsorelative to player level? So a level 19 player killing a level 10monster would get less exp than a level 5 player killing the samelevel 10 monster. This sorta thing would encourage high level playersto fight high level monsters. This in view of the change to exp amountsfor mid- and low-level monsters. Sandbagging for levels should not beencouraged I think. -Snow**Idea(maledicta):**I always thought that experience should be based onwhat you do, and if you are the one being hit. If wecould somehow work up a way to record the damage doneto a mob by each player doing it, as well as who istaking the damage, then I think that would be the bestway to distribute xp, as well as fix the party problemwe are running into. This would also solve ppl hurtinga mob, and then a low level coming in and wacking it realquick for all the xp gain. Make ppl work for it:)I think this could be done, let me know what you thinkand if its possible.                 Mal**pets(maledicta):**I say lets make pets like kids, you level them, feedthem, etc etc. You purchase a pet and put it somewherelike the daycare. Lets limit side attacks more, seemsto make ppl want to use this interesting side of themud alot less. Pets can become very complex, and yetstill easy for players to use.  pet intelligence, attacks,size(determines some hps as well as how much it needsto be fed), level, attack damage, spells, skills, etcI will try to work up some more things on this.                   Mal**New Monster Chart(feldegast):**I would appreciate it if everybody would check out the newmonster chart I have been working on.  It is in/open/feldegast/monster_chart.new.  It's primary features arethat it increases the scale to level 30, and that it smooths outsome of the problems after level 15.  I didn't mess much with thelittle newbie monsters, because I worked that chart out mostlywith a simulator, and it indicated that newbie monsters were basiclyinfinite coins...But that's another issue.  I'd appreciate it ifyou'd give me your thoughts...I'd also like everybody else's feedback on how we should changethe player side of combat, since that is an aspect of our domain thatwe haven't discussed much.  I think we should give players multipleattacks per round, or at least give that as a feature for guilds toexpand upon.  Possibly make dual wielding a part of the lib too...Feldegast**"
