A duel was fought between Alexander Shott and John Nott. Nott was shot and
Shott was not. In this case it is better to be Shott than Nott. Some said
that Nott was not shot. But Shott says that he shot Nott. It may be that the
shot Shott shot, shot Nott, or it may be possible that the shot Shott shot,
shot Shott himself. We think, however, that the shot Shott shot, shot not
Shott, but Nott. Anyway it is hard to tell which was shot and which was not.
