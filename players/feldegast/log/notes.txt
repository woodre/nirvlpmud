He told Sed that he was working on a mud that was about to go beta.  He was logging in and spamming people on the village green with a nuke message.

Caught Wolfbane botting...Trigger was 'Wolfpac says: monster_name'.
Spell idea: reconaissance.
It shows what's in the surrounding rooms.
Pheret thought Arrow was Kazer?
Look at tellblock code.
Remember to toss Exile in jail if Kazer logs him in again...That's the char that he was doing the looka cheat with.
Reason for not approving Minus:
-=[Maledicta]=- : he yelled at me one day for not logging out my char and solving some prob he had with
minus...then today he decided to announce who my wiz was with luckycurse in the room...out of spite.  So i let
him know i would tell the seniors my opinion of him and see to it he would not wiz...as well as block him from
my guild.

-=[Maledicta]=- : he is annoying and 15 or 16 yrs old...so action is the only thing he will listen too

Idea: A library with facilities for allowing players to write and store books placed in the village.

Damion had six hurtbrain strength potions.  Where'd he get them from?
He only has six locker slots and three of them are full.
