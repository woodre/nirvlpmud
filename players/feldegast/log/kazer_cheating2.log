%  The market square is by far the largest of the five plazas of
Sudakan.  This is where the common folk buy and sell their meager
goods.  In the center of the square is a large fountain, decorated
with gold leaf.  In its center, a dolphin spits water up in the air
in a continuous stream.

%  The Royal Plaza is by far the most majestic of the five plazas of
Sudakan.  The Sultan's palace, its golden minarets shining in the
sun overlooks the tiled plaza, which is surrounded by a circle of
magnificently fluted and adorned columns.  In the center of the
plaza is the statue of some fierce creature on a pedestal.  Half a
turn away from the palace is a shop set well apart from the others
and constructed from white marble.
