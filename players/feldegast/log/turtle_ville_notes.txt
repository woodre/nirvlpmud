Turtleville notes
-----------------
5/5/98
tspath1.c - apperance ->appearance
postmaster.c - shinny->shiny
glint IN the light
Shouldn't it be "A postman's hat"?
Also, there's nothing to indicate why it would provide more
protection than other hats.  (ac2)
tville_fount.c - roofs tops -> roof tops
The fountain is too spammy.
Rewrite the last sentence of the long.  It looks awful.
fountain - wonderfull -> wonderful
drank
drank -> drunk (drink?)
You might want to combine the last two sentences of the fountain
description.  Also... which->whom 'wish'->'wish'ed
twpath1.c - shinying -> shining
there -> their
shell like -> shell-like
twpath2.c -
Change 'To the east leads back into town.' to 'To the east the road leads back into town.' or 'A town is to the east.' or 'To the east is the town.' or anything but the murderous butchery of the english language that it is at the moment.
tnpath1.c - 'The roads are nicely paved with the sky blah blah blah'  WITH the sky?  I dinnae think so.
tville_adv.c - 'the' shields
outlaying -> outlying
'On the back of the wall some pictures of great battles hang.'
sylic -
'You are much TOO advanced to be trained by me.'
shellmail - turtules -> tortillas
bloodlust - 'The hilt is decorated with silver and rubies and the blade has many ancient runes carved into it.'
advance hall, pictures - greusome -> gruesome
tville_shoppe.c - sqeaks -> squeaks
Work on the third sentence.  It needs help.
shopkeeper - maning -> manning
distinquished -> distinguished
shell smith - midle -> middle
garbs -> garb
The shell armor descriptions are kinda monotonous.
In the case statement of the shell smith, you misspelled 'shellshield'.
mikel - makes -> make
easiably -> easily
hes -> he's
hardy -> hearty??  hardly??? no idea here
tnpath3.c - a -> an
'as south'??? What do you mean 'as south'?

tnpath5.c -
streaching -> stretching
seemed -> seem
'The west' -> 'To the west, the paved road leads back into town.'  Again, anything but 'The west'.

encumbances -> emcompasses
erh, encompasses

General comments
----------------
I think you did a good job with general concept, with the npc's
and the monsters, but I also think you didn't do a very good job
on your room descriptions.  You don't seem to have as many typos
as you'd had in the graveyard, but you had alot more grammar
problems and sentences that just don't sound right.

I think you're going to have trouble drawing a crowd.  As a
stand-alone area, it has nothing in it that can't be found
elsewhere(with the exception of the healing potion).  A few of
the npc's in town have good weapons, but I think players will be
reluctant to kill monsters in town if they provide services(this
is just a hunch).  Since your castle is located in such a remote
location and nothing else is nearby, I think you need to cover
all of the bases(monsters, heals, armor, weapons, transportation).
Hmm...I should keep that in mind myself.  Anyway, I think you
should put more stuff into the town.  It doesn't seem complete
like it is.  You could have an old graveyard(okay, that's been
done to death on here), a secret passage beneath the magus tower,
a dead body beneath city hall, a statue of the town founder, a
quiet nook where lovers meet, anything.  I just think you need
something to show that this isn't just another arbitrary place
for selling loot and buying armor.  Keep that in mind...

As for how you should connect Turtleville to your area, I think
you should connect it to the mushroom grove.  The road leading
east from the fountain could connect to the second(?) room after
you enter the grove.  It'd be nice if you could connect it to
your dryant graveyard as well, but I'm not as familiar with that
area.  I think players would be more likely to stop by Turtleville
if they were just coming back from slaughtering a few nonges.
Oh well...Just a few thoughts.  Take 'em or leave 'em...
