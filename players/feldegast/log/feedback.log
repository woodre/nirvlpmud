players/feldegast/arena/rooms/spar_entry:
sparring thing: if you type 'kill_players spar' once, it says it's been set, but it's only set to 1 (regular pk flag?) if you type it again it's set to 3, which is where it should be.... when it's removed, it's removed to 1....so the problem is both in 'kill_players spar' and in rm_spar() potentially....
