Generally, I think you did a good job on this area, BUT, I noticed some
typos, problems with grammar, and phrases that simply sounded odd despite
being technically correct.

I wrote down some of the big problems that I noticed on my initial sweep.  It
is not a complete list, since I stopped writing stuff down partway through so
I could just look around.

If you have any questions(I realize some of my notes are a little cryptic),
feel free to ask.
