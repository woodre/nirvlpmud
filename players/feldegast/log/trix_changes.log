This is a list of changes done to Trix's area:
I removed a few lines from the menu on Trix's vending machine because one of the items was no longer being sold(flirter) and the other was redundant(emoter).
t/closed/obj/button.c is an autoloading button that produces roses.
t/closed/obj/lamby.c is basicly an autoloading emoter.
t/closed/obj/necklace.c is a backdoor to Trix's workroom for a player who no longer exists.
The flirter is now part of the mudlib...So it doesn't need to autoload either.
I completely redid t/castle/town/monst/comb.c
It WAS a blank object with short() and Long() done, but I made it into a treasure item, added weight, and fixed a typo.
Otherwise, the same.
I took out about half of the slaughter rooms in front of the EclYpsE since I didn't see any point to them.
I had to fix a few mapping problems after my first review of the quest.
When Eurale went over it, he moved some stuff around and forgot to check all of the joints.
The first problem had to do with the room leading to Ox and the wooden case.
Before I changed it, there were two ways to get there.
The first, and original method was to go through 1 of 2 corridors leading there.
The second, which Eurale implemented was to simply go south from the graffiti room.
Since the original method seemed to fit better with the room structure, I simply changed the exit to Eurale's version of the graffiti room to Trix's version of the graffiti room.
Another possible solution would be to remove the passageway leading to the two corridors and leaving Eurale's change as is.
But I don't think I should leave all those guards there for players to fight for nothing.
The other snafu involved two corridors from the same intersection.  One leads to a very hostile orc, the other leads to the end of the quest.
The idol statue room led back to the wrong corridor and I fixed it.
Some other quest changes: I added 'grate' and 'grating' to the possible words you can use when searching the grating.
When I did it, using the word 'grid' made no sense to me.
Players can also use 'put amulet in hole' instead of 'put amulet into hole'.
That's for the brass hatch.
I hate syntax puzzles so I see no reason to encourage them.
I moved the realm entrance from room/townh to room/forest6.
My reason for this was that I wanted to reduce clutter around the
village, as well as the fact that it was a silly place to put
a castle.
While it might make it harder for players to get there, I
think having a castle right next the church was an unfair
advantage which has now been rectified.
