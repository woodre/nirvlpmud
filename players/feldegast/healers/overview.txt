Karma
-----
All healers have karma.  Karma is gained by healing others,
and is lost when you use your magic to harm others.  When
a healer's karma becomes negative,  they no longer be able to
use many of their powers.

Advancement:
-----------
Healers advance through 6 guild ranks.  To advance
to a rank, the healer must go to the healer hall and donate
experience to the next rank.  There are level requirements
for each rank.  Level is checked each time spells are cast
so there won't be any high-powered level 5 healers.
