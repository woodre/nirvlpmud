The Book of Nevilyn

I have tread the roads and valleys of this world for well over a hundred
seasons.  I have set the bones of kings, purged diseases from wise philosophers,
and bandaged the poor and the weak with equal willingness.  Although I am widely
considered to be the greatest healer of my time, such was not always the case.

Many years ago, I was a foolish and callow youth.  Wandering the world one day,
lost and hungry, I stumbled upon the house of the man who would be my master,
Halas Talongi.  Hoping to steal a loaf of bread, I entered the kitchen through
a window.  What a fool I was!  Although he must've been pushing 90 back then, he
disarmed me in three heart beats.  Before I knew what was what, I was lying on the
floor with a knot on my head from his staff.

It was Master Halas' order-sense that gave me away.  The source of a Healer's magic
is the delicate interweaving of order and chaos.  A true Healer can sense without
seeing the order and chaos in swords, plows, cattle, daisies, wheelbarrows, and 
basicly anything you can imagine.  Master Halas sensed the presence of an intruder
with chaos in his heart, and acted accordingly.  Luckily for me, Master Halas also
detected a thread of order in me.  Although I'd made many poor choices, I was not 
irredeamable.  

He took pity upon me and made me his apprentice.  He awoke the order-sense in me and
taught me how to manipulate the flows of order and chaos.  At first I could only
perform simple tasks, such as bandaging the local villagers, or making simple
potions to cure common colds.  In time, I learned to use the order-sense to
accelerate the healing process, to make a farming tool nearly indestructible by
infusing it with order, to enhance the village workers by making their metabolisms
more efficient.  When the pox struck the sheep at a nearby village, I purged the
chaos from their bodies and cured them.  I learned how to manipulate energy through 
complicated weaves of order and chaos, so that I could surround myself and others
with a shield against harm.

In time, my skills became reknowned and I became much sought-after by groups of
adventurers who needed a healer to mend their wounds.  Sitting around the campfire
one autumn night, one of my companions asked me why if I could increase order in
a living thing to make it stronger, why could I not use the same technique to 
inflict chaos upon evil-doers?  In truth, I had not considered this before,
although the idea troubled me.  With my companion's encouragement, I attempted
this in our next battle, which was fought against the Count de Viscoy and his
mercenaries.  The Count was certainly an evil man.  He had kidnapped, killed,
and pillaged.  But as soon as I began using my magic to increase the chaos in
him, I was afflicted by a blinding headache and fell to the ground.  Later that
evening, after the battle was won, I noticed that my order-sense was reduced in
strength.  I suspect that if I continued using my Healing to inflict harm, I 
would eventually be unable to use some of my more complicated abilities.  

An unusual exception to this drawback came to my attention when my companions
and I fought the Spawn of the Necromancer B'altu'demar.  I found that the spells
that animate undead creatures such as skeletons and ghouls, imposing as they do
an artificial order, are quite easy to disrupt.
