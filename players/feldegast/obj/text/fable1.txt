The Delinquent Fowl

  Once upon a time, all the animals were summoned to a meeting.  As
they converged on the public square early in the morning one of them,
the fowl, was spotted by his neighbors going in the opposite direction.
They said to him, "How is it that you are going away from the public
square?  Did you not hear the town crier's summons last night?"
  "I did hear it," said the fowl, "and I should certainly have gone
to the meeting if a certain personal matter had not cropped up which
I must attend to.  I am truly sorry, but I hope you will make my
sincere apologies to the meeting.  Tell them that though absent in
body I will be there with you in spirit in all your deliberations.
Needless to say that whatever you decide wil receive my whole-hearted
support."
  The question before the assembled animals was what to do in the
face of a new threat posed by man's frequent slaughtering of animals
to placate his gods.  After a stormy, but surprisingly brief debate
it was decided to present to man one of their numbers as his regular
sacrificial animal if he would leave the rest in peace.  And it was
agreed without a division that the fowl should be offered to man to
mediate between him and his gods.  And it has been so ever since.
