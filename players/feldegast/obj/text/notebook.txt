Notes culled from the library of Castle Magnarn:

Soulstone
  - catalyst for necromantic energy
  - often used in Majiri ritual
  - Words of power: torak/karot
  - records indicate that it was hidden here, but where?
  - Conclusion: It is frequently associated with demonology in Majiri
    lore.  We should find it and take it back to the tower for
    safekeeping.

Majiri
  - a powerful magiocracy ruling from 20??-3566 A.W.
  - empire disintegrated approximately 200 years prior to landfall by
    Andoran settlers on the west coast of Chalynsta
  - signs of their civilization still remain in the form of ruins and
    powerful magical artifacts, but little is known about them
    otherwise


Castle Magnarn
  - A minor outpost in the hey-day of the empire, it became the last
    refuge of the Council of Magelords after the empire's fall.
  - Question: What happened to its inhabitants?
  - Evidence of mass graves
  - Records indicate some sort of plague, but where did it originate?
  - Surviving population headed northeast, perhaps settling in what is
    now Sudakan.

Jal-Hab
  - A powerful demon of nomad lore.  According to legend, a Majiri king
    foolishly invited him into our world, Allandria.
  - Is the desert named after the demon, or is the demon named after
    the desert?  Probably not worth researching.
  - If there were a demon still loose, then we would know about it, but
    there is no record of Jal-Hab being destroyed?  Either way, this
    falls under the charter of the Order of the Wall.
  - If even half of this is true, then it indicates a serious breech
    in the Cosmic Seal.  We should check the Prophecies to make sure
    it isn't a sign of bigger things to come.
