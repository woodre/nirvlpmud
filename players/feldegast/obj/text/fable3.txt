The Hare and the Antelope

  Hare and Antelope once fell into a hole.  Let me climb on your back
first, then I shall pull you out, said Hare.  So Hare climbed on
Antelope's back and out he jumped onto dry sunny ground.  He dusted himself
off and started walking away.  Hey, you are forgetting me, shouted
Antelope.  Hare lectured Antelope, Let me advise you, my friend.  I fell
into the same hole with you by mistake.  The trouble with you, Mr Antelope
is that you go jump-jumping leap-leaping in the air instead of firmly
walking on the ground and looking to see where you are going.  I am sorry
but you have only yourself to blame.
