The Snake and the Frog

  One day a snake was riding his horse coiled up, as was his fashion,
in the saddle.  As he came down the road he met the toad walking by
the roadside.
  "Excuse me, sir," said the toad, "but that's not the way to ride a
horse."
  "Really?  Can you show me the right way, then?" asked the snake.
  "With pleasure, if you will be good enough to step down a moment."
  The snake slid down the side of his horse and the toad jumped with
alacrity into the saddle, sat bolt upright and galloped most elegantly
up and down the road.  "That's how to ride a horse," he said at the
end of his demonstration.
  "Very good," said the snake, "very good indeed, you may now come
down."
  The toad jumped down and the snake slid up the side of his horse
back into the saddle and coiled himself up as before.  Then he said to
the toad, "Knowing is good, but having is better.  What good does fine
horsemanship do to a fellow without a horse?"  And then he rode away
in his accustomed manner.
