general wc bonus is 1+ random combat so ranges 0-21, or if considered too much drop it to /2
add dwield to last guild rank, gives weapon a shadow, similiar to fireblade, 
but can't give to other players, you unwield, or drop weapon it disappears.

only be able to wear certain types of main armor.
give monster sickness, allowing you to hit him slightly better limited time, at high sp cost, and spell delay
change cost of spells to be based off combat level, so the stronger the spell/the higher the cost
and if your combat sucks, the spell will suck but atleast won't cost u a fortune for a sucky spell
for the benefit of the other skills etc, remove the guild pets from the old version
