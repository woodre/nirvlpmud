Please update mobs based on readme in each directory. Use 
/doc/build/monster/monster.guide to determine what needs
to be upgraded. I have given you what I think the level is
and you just need to use the chart to update the mob.
You can add coins to make it line up with the guide.

Spells should be updated to the new style. Add color
and some interesting spells. May need to do some custom
coding for the bigger mobs level 26 and higher.  Use
the add_spell function, it is much more flexible than the
older set_spell_dam/set_spell_mess functions.

I would leave gear/objects/armor as is, if you have any
burning ideas let me know.

Thanks, let me know if you have any questions.
