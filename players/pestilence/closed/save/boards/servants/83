The guild is now open...new recruits heres a bit of info to get you started.

The main area of the ghall IS pk and invadeable, the safe rooms are on this floor so dont idle at login.

Read Help files (obviously). There is alot of useful information in there, as you advance you will want to look at dhelp mon and set your own mon up to help keep track of things.

Being good is a bad thing, we get hurt for it just like we do in light. Some rooms in game however even though we can see in the dark will still show 'a dark room' for the room description.

Finally...let the blood spill.
