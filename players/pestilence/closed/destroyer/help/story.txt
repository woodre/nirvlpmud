  It all began, one snowy day when a thought entered the mind of
the already demented Pestilence.  Pestilence decided he needed
an army to help him conquer the realms of Nirvana.  But it 
couldn't be any normal army.  So he contacted his close friend,
Rolin.  Rolin agreed to help Pestilence.  They then enlisted
the help of a mad scientist, who specialized in the field of
gentic mutations.  Through many experiments, a formula was 
made to make members of Pestilence's army superior physically.
But Pestilence worried about the army turning on him, so
he had the scientist make the soldiers of this army have
a lower intellect and knowledge of magic, making them
easier to be controlled by Pestilence.
