	Long ago, the the ancient lands of Nirvana, there was
a man name Zalactis.  He was a guild member of the Knights
Templar.  Unhappy with the riteous path of the Knights, he
left them in search of the darkness he desired.
	Traveling for many years, he eventually found a
cave on the island called Cahara.  Darkness was more
than what was found deep inside this cave.  Deep
within the ground at the deadend of the caverns,
Zalactis found what he desired.  Before him was a demon from
the netherworld.  The demon offered Zalactis powers that
would darken his heart, at the cost that he shall ever
be committed to give the powers eternal life, through
his teachings.
	Zalactis accepted the powers from the demon, and started
to build a place of worship and training.  This became the 
guild hall to the Dark Order.  The hall is located on the 
very island where the dark cave was found.  Within the
guild there are several undead trainers, to extend Zalactis's
knowledge to future members.
	The combat Zalactis learned while with the Knights,
was combined with the dark magic from the demon.  The demon
showed Zalactis that through restricting one's armor, they
can use their weapons in a more viscious way, causing more
damage to their opponents.  Now is the time for the 
teachings to be passed on to you.
