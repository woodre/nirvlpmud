1.  This is an evil guild.  I feel that evil
shouldn't be restricted to killing just good.
But be advised, maintaining a good alignment
might not be such a good idea.
 
2.  Do not kill other guild members, remember
they share the same line of blood now as you do.
If one becomes a nuisance bring it up to Pesty.
 
3.  To obtain the powers of the darkness, and
the strength of combat, you must sacrifice
the ability to use head,feet armor, ring,
underwear and a shield.
 
4.  Letting someone drink your blood to obtain
the path to our powers, they must be atleast
level 10.
 
5.  After they drank your blood, YOU are now
responsible for their actions in the guild!
If they are deemed bad for the guild it will
look very bad on you.  So choose wisely.
 
6.  Have fun, and never abuse anything.
