A heads up on our guildmates. This conversation took place tonite as soon as I logged on. There were only 2 people that I talked to about mailing you about Bloodangle. That is Shadowraith and Sid. So I assume it was one of them. Most likely Shadowraith, since she has an attitude problem with me now because I told her that recruiting someone and then going inactive to avoid being kicked out the guild was stupid. Anyway, I dont feel that someone should be telling things to former members or anyone outside of the guild, yet I have no proof it was her or anyone else. But here is the convo:

Bloodangle growls at you from afar.
Bloodangle tells you: you got ratted out
You tell bloodangle yes?
You tell bloodangle on?
Bloodangle tells you: getting me kicked out
You tell bloodangle I got you kicked out?
Bloodangle nods solemnly at you from afar.
Bloodangle tells you: said i was being annoying
You tell bloodangle Wow, amazing.
Bloodangle tells you: what i was saying
Bloodangle tells you: got dogged by a friend i thought
You tell bloodangle umm whatever?
Bloodangle tells you: just what i was told so i will ask you if it is true?
You tell bloodangle I didnt get you kicked out. But yes, you were annoying. :)
Bloodangle tells you: how and did you report it?
You tell bloodangle You were told repeatedly to read the help files. You didnt.
You just kept on and kept on asking stupid questions that
could be answered by reading. And yes, I mailed Pestilence.
Bloodangle tells you: so it was ok and i didn't understand the help files why i
asked
You tell bloodangle The things you kept asking were very simply put in the help
files. You should have read them better.
Bloodangle tells you: ok just wanted to know


I hope this will be addressed. Not sure how it can be handled.. but something should be done.
