Sun Aug 24 16:12:32 2014 Chant is reporting Idea - Dark Order Paths. Path of "Demonology" You get Demon as a lower level spell and Fiend as a high level spell. All other spells are the same. With the Exception of the other Paths Spells. Path of "Pestilence" You get Infect and Sickness The timer of sickness could be less as it you would give up the demon path to get that path or vice a versa - This comes down to Path of Demonology "PK" or the Path of Pestilence "PVE".  Seems like an interesting idea...maybe
