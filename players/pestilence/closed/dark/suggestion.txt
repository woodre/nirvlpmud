Opening up recruiting will take away some of the annoying people constantly harrassing those of us that do play to recruit them all the time, i get seriously tired of telling each and everyone i can't or wont at this time.
Opening up the ghall is just a small price to pay....and hey, like you said, we can always kill em.
The 3 strike rule also sounds good.... although i think the finding the guildhall part will keep most of the idiots out.
One question tho...heh, totally off the subject....are we going to get mini guilds back? I was told you were working on that, but i thought i'd just ask from the source instead of hinging on some rumor.

Thanks, Shadowraith.

here is an idea but i know it sounds a lot like the vampire system and it kinda is cept only takes one person to allow you to get in have them post a note saying why they would like to join the guild and what they could bring to the guild.
although this would require me and ruby to play more i dont think that would be a problem for me 
oh yeah might wanna check bug logs
thanx
