 - change this whole long desc.  Shouldn't have things that mention things about mobs
   in the room.  Once you kill the mobs your room desc doesn't make sense.

 - In your long desc I'm not liking this line try revising it:
   'Who knows what is in store for the adventurer who follows this path'

path6.c
 - long desc 'Further to the north is a small garden much like the one you dropped into.'
   Get rid of the much like the one you dropped into.
