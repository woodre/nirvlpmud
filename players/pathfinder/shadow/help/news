Whats happening around Shadow-land...  

1.  Gods said no go to the spell point pool so it got nixed.
2.  Spells are being changed to do delayed damage.  cuz of limits
    put forth by the gods.
3.  speedster is in the works.
4.  Pets are being coded... will need to make some changes to the
    other parts of the guild to accomidate them.  They will be
    basic until I get more time to code a really good pet.  

Okey thats about all for now.  if you have questions or such
let a gc or me know.  or post it.
