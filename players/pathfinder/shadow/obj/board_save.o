tmp_text "Ok here is the deal.  I will give people promos and such for coming up with_GREAT_ ideas for spells, abilities, powers, etc for the guild.These are things that are _possible_ to be implemented here on Nirvana.I have some things that are complete and that are going to be goinginto the guild soon enough, so those will not count.But things to be taken out of guild soon:Shadow Points -- gods hate themThings to go inplague spell,spell to have opponents shadow attack them.servantthings just in:compare -- cmpfoepkwho -- pkwPathfinder**Ok new abilities to old and new guild alike, they deal with the spell point pool, this WILL be taking over the shadow points.... and itworks by donations.. I am going to write a help file on this sooneror later =)  ....  the commands aredonate <amt>  (donate some of your spell points)withdraw <amt>  (take some spell points)amount   (find how much spell points are there)Try it....  I hope you like itPathfinder**Ok the command to donate to the pool is depositits not donate like it was beforePathfinder**Here some non-shadow related message.I finished my internship in the U.S.A. and leaving for The Netherlandstomorrow. I think I can get an account there where I can keep on buggingyou people. If not, I'll let Beppie maintain my character for better days......So you might see me again, might not. In any case, keep up the good workin this guild.think that we can be a pretty cool guild. We just need some stuff more, but pathfinder almost finished that. All we need more are somecool emotes to make shadowlife more fun than it already is :)C ya in a different time zone :)Barjan**Note:The new sp pool will only work if u GIVE as much as u TAKE... pool wasstocked to over 5000 yesterday.., yet at 0 this morning...  ALso.., Do nottake more than u can use..., (i.e don't take 1000, I know no one butpath can handle that much...)...Thanks!!!!**Ok Lap, about the spell point pool... it gets reset at every reboot.  The 5000 sps that were there were gone after reboot because it does not savethe  total during reboots.  I wish I could do that but that would onlyfurther serve more gods breathing down my back.  Also, I am going to logeach transaction of the pool, this is so I can track it later on, to determine who is going to be hogs and who is going to be generous.  I don'tmind people who use the pool extensively if they are doing some major combatbut if you are on another time and not planning on doing anything one timeyou login, just give what you can to the pool.  We all would appreciate it.by the way --- the functions for the pool are --to give to the pool -- depositto get from the pool -- withdrawcheck the amt of the pool --  amount. Pathfinder.**Another Shadow idea: kill1 kill2... ability to do normal kill with wielded weapon, but it uses alternate shadow-specific text instead ofx "hit " y "hard", "very hard" for example:Mrmessy's shadow chokes MissionaryMrmessy's shadow strangles MissionaryMrmessy's shadow hits DemonMrMessy's shadow slams Demon against the wallMrMessy's shadow crushes Demonetc. etc. suffocation with shadow, other "atmosphere-related" ways to doa normal attack...**I notice that noone ever drops off equipment in the room east of here; theonly profitable alternative is to go to the shop, and get 1000 maximum coinsfor anything you pick up, except to buy a locker, which I don't knowif you can really use for everything.  The next best thing is to cut a dealwith someone where you get more than 1000 but less than what the "thing" isworth.  I propose a "Shadow Swap Meet" which is really just a shop which gives you 75% of value for your equipment, which basically makes it easier tocut deals among shadows (which we will do anyway); this is to justify it inthe eyes of the GODS.  The only equpipment which makes it there are the thingswe pick up and would otherwise trade or sell at a fair price to each otherWhattaya think?      MrMessy**An invoke shadow spell that is a weaker version of invisibility, it temporarily improves your armor class...**heh heh hehh hehh hehh hehh hhehh hehh hehhBack by dope demand**Hey shadez... spell point pool is removed... the functions are still therebut it won't do crap.  I will try to do something similar to replace it sooneror later.Pathfinder**We should be able to have a spell where we can make player's shadows scare them off! Kinda like tying their shoe lavs together  or fearing them like in the Vamp guild.Taco**sorry about message 13  I messed up :)   All shadows or at least the guild commanders should be able to pull out flyers about the guild.  T;hey should have stuff like descriptions of our spells, info about the guild , ed(ect)  It will ha(help) with recruiting.  forgive the way this message looks my space (backspace) doesn't work   I cannot correct any typing mistakes I make****Hey guys, it's been fun but I got alot of work that I should be doingFinals are coming up and all and I have to be concentrating more. Therefore I can't play this game too much anymore so if I do not see you, bye.
