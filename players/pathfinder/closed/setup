Basic guild setup:

  Disadvantages:  
  
  <1>
    Perhaps the greatest disadvantage is the fact that light damages
    guild members- see /players/mythos/closed/guild/lightdam.c for
    more details into the light damager.  Basically for each point
    of light in the room the player takes that amount of damage per 
    heartbeat (call_out of 3). <player may die>
    
  <2>
    The player must sacrifice items and such.  Check sacrifice_values
    in this directory for more info.  For most spells sacrifice points 
    are needed - players do not know the numbers.  If sacrifice is not
    needed then other compensation is used- hp,xp,etc.
    
  <3>
    Guild hall is not protected by shield.  Members must protect their
    guild hall themselves- to compensate in guild hall area members
    may use their spells on players.  Should guild orb be taken from 
    guild hall, all members on mud take 50 damage <player may die>.
    Orb has some powers that other players may covet.
  
  <4>
    May not use alcohol type healing.  
  
  <5>
    Death has a disadvantage.  If you die you must kill a demon before
    they may return to the rest of the mud.
  
  Advantages:
  
  <1>
    Some attack spells have lower cost and may do more damage then 
    recognized as legal.  Also, about spells- a lot of very different
    spells.
    
  <2>
    Diseases and poisons do not work in general.
    
  <3>
    Darkness is not a barrier to sight.
    
  <4>
    Not quite an advantage but, taking idea that arrina supplied, should
    a fight ooccur between guild member and another player- should oppenent
    wimpy/disconnect/or quit, guild member gains some xp.  Should guild member
    run etc. loses a bit.
    
  <5>
    Extra sp after mag goes to 20.  For ever fae 4 sp extra.  This is done
    by increasing mag by fae/2 after mag has been set to 20.
    
    
Basic Info about guild:

  <1>
    Guild members gain guild levels through tasks.
    
  <2>
    Some spells are not limited by guild level, however to gain such spells
    a task must be done and the spell found. - these are the task dependant
    spells -
