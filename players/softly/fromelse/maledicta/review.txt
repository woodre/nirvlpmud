Vamps Review:

The vampires (major) drawbacks are as follows:

1. Hurt by light. -1 damage per point of light in the room, up to 5 max.
2. Need Bloodpoints to perform powers.
3. They have to fight mobs to advance in the guild.

The Vampires (major) powers are as follows:

1. +2 wc to the player.
2. Ability to transfer hps and sps with very little loss.
   For instance, transfer 25 sps to hps gives the following
   effect:  25 is checked on the blood pts chart and returns
   a 1 cost, then 25/10 = 2.5(I believe that is rounded down)
   so 2.0 loss.  The loss is randomized: random(2) which 
   returns either a 1 or 0.  25 - loss = 24 or 25 gain. Almost
   no loss.
3. Demon attack is equal to sonic in almost every way. 2 blood cost.
4. Vampire Speed, gives a max of 24 damage on a hit_player(). This
   allows a vampire to do 2 hit_players each round, therefore going
   over the cap set at 56 damage against players. 
5. Darkness regens a vampire quicker. Any darkness < 0.
6. a vampire can store up to 3 items in a coffin.(helps to avoid
   eq problems)
7. Numerous other 'helpful' accessories.

Cyberninja Review:

Drawbacks:
1. requires a decent amount of xp and a large amount of coins to 
   advance in the guild.
2. Not able to wear the best armors.
3. Requires honor to be the best in the guild.

Major Powers:
1. Almost every possible power in some form. hp->sp, sp->hp, equil,
   detoxer, see in darkness, calm, retreat, lead, transto, etc etc.
2. p3 is nearly equal to a sonic.
3. Defense mode makes them nearly impervious to attacks.
4. Blades and such that use heal_self for damage. Allows for over
   the cap damage.
5. Weapon has excellent potential.
6. extra attacks vs. mobs. (overload, flux)


Knights Review:
Drawbacks:
1. Magic drops to 12.
2. ste drops to 10.
3. need coins to use powers.
4. Need xp to advance in the guild(not overly expensive)

Powers:
1. bonus ac & wc with skills.
2. ice is almost a sonic equivalent.
3. heal spells, cure.
4. bless allows a +1 to wc.
5. may store 3 items in templar rooms.
6. Numerous 'other' powers.


Dervish Review:
drawbacks:
1. Armor restrictions based on level.
2. No wimpy.
3. Need corpses or take damage.
4. Must lead in combat until a higher level.
5. Death means the possibility of losing powers.

Powers:
1. Dual wield. Allows for major damage and potential.
2. Sonic equivalent spell.
3. confuse, doubles damage.
4. Needs only player experience.


Symbiotes Review:
Drawbacks:
1. No spells when unchanged.
2. Need MP to change form and use certain powers. (corpses)
3. AC averages 2-3.
4. If a symb gets too low on hps they revert back and are frozen for 3-5 rounds.
5. No quit in combat.
6. Other minuses(no mini's, invisible, pets)
7. Spell damage maxes at an average of 15 for their mainstay spell.
   Other spell is on a 5-7 round delay.
8. 1/2 xp gain from killing. Overall effect is needing over 24 million
   xp to max out at +21 level.
9. Harmed by healing. A subtle tactic that sucks in pk.
10. Death means the possibility of losing powers.(and double normal to
    get it back)

Powers:
1. Excellent WC potential. (average of 35 in hypermode)
2. Other helpful spells(flee, burnoff, web)
3. Bite spell and special heals. Bite spell has about shock 
   potential on average.
4. AC can be 14 on a 5% chance.
5. Harden is an excellent defense almost equal in power to cybs
   defense mode.
