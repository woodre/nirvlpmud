INSTRUCTIONS : INSTALLING BLACKBEARD

    For all rooms except the one in which you wish
    to have Blackbeard start from, add a object p;
    after reset(arg) and after if(arg) return;
    put this code in:

    if(p = present("blackbeard", this_object()))
    {
      move_object(p, "/room/void");
      destruct(p);
    }

    For the room in which you wish to place blackbeard,
    just check to make sure he's not there
    if(!present("blackbeard", this_object())) clone_it_blah();
    
    A good idea would be to initialize the random movement
    from the beginning, maybe when someone enters the lighthouse,
    load the room you wish to start him from with a call_other,
    and call the john_candy() function in his object.
