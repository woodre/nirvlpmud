* m_indices(mapping map) .. the same thing as keys(map) ..
    just an alias cause i'm used to another driver

* reconstruct_mapping(mixed *array)..
   takes array and makes a new map with 
   element1 its key, and element2 the key's value and so on,
   infinitely.  there must be an even number of elements
   in the array, obviously.  example..

	   mapping map;
	   string *a;

	   a = ({ "dog", "woof", "cat", "meow" });
	   map = reconstruct_mapping(a);
  
   map would be:
    ([ "dog" : "woof", "cat" : "meow" ]);

   this is useful for restoring maps.

* deconstruct_mapping(mapping map) ..
   takes map and breaks it down into an array.
   example..

	   mapping map;
         string *b;

         map = ([ "car" : "beep", "goose" : "honk" ]);
         b = deconstruct_mapping(a);

    b would be:
     ({ "car", "beep", "goose", "honk" });

    this is useful for saving maps.

* int member(mixed what, mixed element) ..

    1] acts as an alias for member_array() ..
       you can check existance of element in
       what.  it returns the position, or -1
       if not found.

       ie
        string *things;
        things = ({ "rock", "stone", "boulder" });
        return member(things, "rock");

        would return 0.  0 is the position of
        "rock" in the array.

    2] mainly used to check mapping 'what' for the
       existance of key 'element'.  returns 1
       if found, else returns 0.

       ie
         mapping map;
         map = ([ "gold" : 200, "silver" : 500 ]);
         return member(map, "gold");

         would return 1, because "gold" is in the map.

* mixed m_delete(mapping map, mixed key)
    completely erases key and its corresponding value
    from map, and returns the new map.  this differs
    a great deal from deletem() because it actually
    DOES delete the value.  if 'key' is not present in map,
    it returns 0.

     ie
       mapping map;
       map = ([ "garfield" : "lasagna", "scooby" : "scooby snacks" ]);
       map = m_delete(map, "garfield");

    the new map would be:
      ([ "scooby" : "scooby snacks" ]);

* string colour_pad(string text, int length)
    this supports the bulk of the pad() efun.
    takes a string, evaluates any ANSI colour code lengths, and adds them
    to the length you specify, and returns a newly padded string.

    previously, if you used pad() without accounting for ANSI colour,

      string str;
      str = RED + "blah" + NORM;

      pad(str, 4); would return only the red ANSI code,
      causing bleeding and just general lameness.
      [each ANSI code (even the escape character) has a length].

    colour_pad() would pad this properly..
      colour_pad(str, 4); would return "[31mblah[2;37;0m"

    *** something should be written here, because Feldegast
    *** gave me the idea to write it, as i'd seen his color_pad
    *** in existance.  i wanted to try my hand at it ;)
