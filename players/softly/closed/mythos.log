(Invis) anshar wizs: Who is Mythos?
(wiz) (invis) anshar grins
Feldegast wizs: He just uploaded and old copy of healers.  All the fixes
I've made have been undone. :(
Maledicta wizs: ack

(Invis) anshar wizs: heh

Maledicta wizs: shut the suckers down...
(Invis) anshar wizs: There are more wizards than players on almost every
time I log in
Feldegast wizs: If we can't fix his crap, then it has got to go.  It is too
buggy to stay as it is.
Maledicta wizs: we have to be able to make adjustments...since we are
HERE...

wiz couldn't you just make a copy, change the copy, point all the guild related calls to the modified copies...
Vital wizs: couldn't you just make a copy, change the copy, point all the
guild related calls to the modified copies...
(Invis) anshar wizs: Remove all guilds, and use a skill system!
wiz and set it up so if a healer logs in with the 'old' object, the healer gets the 'new' one
Vital wizs: and set it up so if a healer logs in with the 'old' object, the
healer gets the 'new' one
(Invis) fakir wizs: That blows.
Maledicta wizs: or block his ftp access if we make the changes again...
(Invis) fakir wizs: Lets take the sucker out.
(Invis) scathe wizs: Hire a hitman and kill him
Cricket has entered the game
(Invis) anshar wizs: Get rid of healers...bogus guild anyway
(Invis) fakir wizs: Just change it all back Feld....pissing wars are fun.
Feldegast wizs: I didn't keep copies of all of the files I've changed, and
some of the changes were quite extensive.
(Invis) anshar wizs: I thought Mythos was gone anyway?
Feldegast wizs: I thought so too.
(Invis) anshar wizs: If he is supposed to be gone, why is he using ftp?
(Invis) fakir wizs: Because he left with the disclaimer...I may be back
someday.
You whisper to Maledicta: in my last conversation with Mythos...

Feldegast wizs: I am beginning to suspect he gets off on pissing people
off.
(Invis) anshar wizs: Hmm...
You whisper to Maledicta: he had set up an 'alternate' site and was developing there

-=[Maledicta]=- : oh, fear
(Invis) anshar wizs: Drop his ftp access until he becomes active again...
-=[Maledicta]=- : dinna know that
(Invis) anshar wizs: Close the healers
Feldegast wizs: How about it Boltar?
(Invis) fakir wizs: Guilds without an active guild wizard should be shut
down...or assumed by an active wizard...and the files changed to his dir.
Feldegast wizs: I think we should treat Mythos as a renegade wizard...

Feldegast wizs: He is deliberately putting bs powerful stuff into the game.
(Invis) anshar wizs: You cannot fix everything time and again just because
Mythos wants to re-upload crap

(Invis) fakir wizs: should have kept a copy.
Feldegast wizs: Healers can now raise ac infinitely, raise stats
infinitely, and cast spells on players that would make them nearly
invincible in pk.
(Invis) fakir wizs: Which is all bull shit.

(Invis) anshar wizs: Close Mythos' castle and be done with it

Feldegast wizs: He may've once been level 700, but his actions remind me of
Kazer more than anything else.
(Invis) anshar wizs: Let him upload shit to his heart's content
(Invis) anshar wizs: Demote him as well, of course

(Invis) fakir wizs: We spent a LOT of time working out the healer
thing...and mythos just changed it all in one fell swoop.

(Invis) anshar wizs: Heh...give me access to all his stuff, and I will
'fix' it =)

Maledicta wizs: anshar, shut up:)

(Invis) anshar wizs: 'Woops! Did I delete that?'

(Invis) anshar wizs: Bite me, Mal
(wiz) (invis) anshar licks Maledicta
Boltar wizs: mythos will have to log in to restore his mud ftp access


(Invis) fakir wizs: yea boltar
Boltar wizs: tell me what files....
(Invis) fakir wizs: is a jan 31 backup any help Feld?


Feldegast wizs: Yes, that should cover all of the changes.
(Invis) fakir wizs: Except the one from last night..if you made that...
Boltar wizs: crap cleaning, we is out of disk space
Feldegast wizs: I haven't made any changes yet to holy_blessing because I
was still getting opinions from others.
Maledicta wizs: we are? hmmm

(Invis) braxana wizs: since feldegast doesnt like me restricting his access
to the healers
(Invis) braxana wizs: my ftp access gets yanked?

(Invis) braxana wizs: *scratches his head*

Feldegast wizs: Mythos, I have been fixing up healers so that they don't
get removed entirely.
(Invis) braxana wizs: that makes alot of sense
Boltar wizs: things get fixed, for maintance.
Boltar wizs: then get unfixed.
(Invis) braxana wizs: feldegast i explicitedly asked wocket and ONLY wocket
to do that
Feldegast wizs: When did you ask that?
Boltar wizs: but I cannot talk to the person because he doesn't log in.
(Invis) braxana wizs: boltar you have my email in consideration to that
Boltar wizs: so I decided to force him to log in.
(Invis) braxana wizs: thanx boltar..:>
Boltar wizs: its simple login, save. mudftp restored.
(Invis) braxana wizs: *laughs*


(Invis) fakir wizs: Wocket is busy with necro guild...and quite a few
others to boot.
Boltar wizs: actually I shouldnt be dealing with this right now....

(Invis) braxana wizs: yes he may be busy
Boltar wizs: considering i'm likely to get axed at work I learned today....
(Invis) braxana wizs: oh shit
Feldegast wizs: I'm sorry to hear that, Boltar. :(
(Invis) braxana wizs: you re getting laid off... sorry man..:<
(Invis) braxana wizs: damn
Boltar wizs: seems I am not good politically so I'll be that lower 15%
they'll axe.
