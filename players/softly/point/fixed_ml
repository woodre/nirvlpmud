Aralie.c - "Change/remove the story, it reads 'daniel tells you:' "DONE
           "And remove the set_wc_bonus in reset()" DONE
           ALSO added a line feed after her tell_object<attacker>
           ALSO changed her alignment from 600 to 0 -- I decided she 
                was stupid and well meaning instead of tragic and wonderful

ashawl.c - "need a '.' at the end of the long()" DONE

bkboots.c - Reset to AC1 and made them savable

bwand.c - "I would rather see this as a type, 'club', can that work?"
          Overtaken by events ... thanks again Mal

erica.c - "Long(): 'She black eyes contain a fire.'" DONE
          ALSO Changed AC to 17, removed cloak, slightly cleaned up the
               visual stuff that went with the attacks to be consistent
               with the wand she wields.  
          WOULD LIKE to add "magical" to her damage but I'm not sure how -
                is it do_damage (([damage}),({"other|magical"})) where 
                damage is an absolute number?  Can it be 30+random(20) ??
                Does this replace set_spell_damage ?
fsabre.c - "You have your weapon_hit messages in reverse, they need to go
           from highest message to worse." DONE
Aruj.c - As per the rules, all mobs above level 19 must have a 
         spell attack. Please add one here, even if its smashing 
         a player with a fist, etc. DONE
Bart.c - Same as Aruj.c, needs spell attack. DONE
BlackBeard.c - needs a special attack. Remove wc_bonus in reset() no
               reason for it. DONE
bonny.c - long(): firey = fiery, DONE
          also needs a spell attack. No reason
          for wc_bonus, remove this in reset().DONE
din.c - Remove the wc_bonus from reset()
        NOT USED ... see kheir.c below
Kheir.c - ditch the wc_bonus.DONE
          He seems to share a desc with a
          couple other mobs, is there anything you can add to
          his desc to make him stand out more?
          ACTION - Kheir and Din are the same mob ... only Kheir is used.
          Kheir and Aruj look the same because they are twin
          brothers ... they appear in the same room at the same
          time.  I got rid of din.c (an old version of Kheir)
kidd.c - need a '.' at the end of the long() DONE
         ALSO added spell damage
morgan.c - REMOVED wc_bonus, added spell attack
read.c - REMOVED wc_bonus, added spell attack


NOTE:
Be sure to go through all the mobs and add a spell_attack and messages
if they are over level 17. DONE .. SEE ABOVE 
Also, remove the set_wc_bonus from all mobs.  You have a high concentration 
of ac2 items, misc, ring, amulet, and boots
and that is too much for a single area to have. Usually an area will
have a single ac2 item so that ppl will search around for it and then
have to go elsewhere to get the next piece.
ACTION ... Removed cloak on erica.  Reset boots to ac1 ... ring remains AC2
