Lighthouse is 8 levels high ...
Sign nailed to the door warning low levels to
keep out.  Requires reading the sign to enter.
Base level is four rooms, a kitchen, living room,
and two bedrooms.   a second 
bedroom was once the bedroom of a young girl.
Enter in the living room which.  Entry from kitchen to
lighthouse itself.  

In the kitchen we find the ghost of Mrs.
Bryant wife of the
lighthousekeeper and a carbon rod that can
be used at for12 to summon Erica.  The other
bedroom will contain lots of disheveled stuff
with some photos that mirror the ones in the cabin

have to read "danger" sign to get into the lighthouse
