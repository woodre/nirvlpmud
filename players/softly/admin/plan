In process: east and northish of my pond a rocky shoreline with a tiny harbor,
  small beach area, rock jetty, and a 20 roomlighthouse filled with the ghosts of 
  pirates whose boats have crashed on the rocks.  Mixed levels.  Upper levels in lighthouse
  which will have a red warning sign on the door.  Part 2 in the search for the
  evil Erica is woven through the place.

In planning, early writing stages:  Small village (dirt road small) containing a mix of shops,
  herbs and other trinkets from a voodoo healer, a "used" clothing shop, an old house
  with a fortune teller (perhaps sitting on the porch), a shabby detective agency, cockfights
  with wagering, a voodoo circle where rituals have been performed, and perhaps a cemetary.
  The cast of characters melds with the rest of my area.  This will be east then south from
  the entrance.

Far down the road:  A river east of the town area (and west of the sea) ... there should
  eventually be a spit of land that emerges between the river and the sea.  Players will 
  find a canoe/raft/small craft and be able to navigate the river.  Rapids will toss them onto
  an island, etc., etc.
