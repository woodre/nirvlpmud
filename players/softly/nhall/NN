messages "This Board(maledicta):**Please feel free to use this board to assist each otherin learning the mud.  I hope that it can be used as atool for all of you Newbies out there learning the mud.Thanks, and please feel free to leave suggestions here,or mudmail me directly.              Thanks,                 Maledicta**headline(cappy):**to hell with you schmoosto hell iwth you schmoos****party(alice):**HI,I NOTICED NOT TO MANY NEW PEOPLE PARTY TOGETHER. iF i AM ON ASK ME TO PARTY. I AM NOT VERY STRONG BUT I AM WILLING TO TAKE RISKS AND TRY TO KILL SOME BIGGER THINGS WITH A COUPLE NEW PEOPLE.ALICE**thanks and good greetings(erehir):**i just wanted to tell Maledicta thanks alot for the board, i am sure it will be of great help to us all as we travel in this world's-realm. i also wanted to give each person that comes here a warm welcome, and tell them that we are here to grow together.**headline(fleas):****welcome to nirvana(glaxgor):**Some people come on this in different ways also there are different places to kill just go u,grab book and just read that book**Guilds(treebeard):**Just as a note to the true newbies.  It is a good idea to figure outpretty early on what guild you want to join.  Some guild have certainrequirements that you can start working towards now, when you are small.If you truely havn't found what you're looking for, then get to lvl 5,and stay there until you max all your stats.  That way you can enjoy nebiebenefits, but still have some power.  just remember though, bigger isn'talways better.  Brain and brawn are useful here.  Have Fun!  Treebeard, the Ent of Doom**Mooching(unseen):**Try not to mooch as much as possible, it will only make you a stronger and more knowledgable character if you do things on your own and see things for yourself.     Thee Unseen**Fastest leveling(almacide):**Alright, beat this pansy newbies.  Try to get to level 5 in less than 35 minutes,useing only the eq that you get in the tutorial north of here.  I'd like to seewhat the fastest leveling is.  Almacide**my time when i started(gohan):**sc**mytime when i started(gohan):**when i started my time for level 5 was 25 minutes**Hey(unseen):**There is a secret to getting newbie levels without fighting. That is extremely quick. Almacide, tis no challenge to those who use their minds and explore.**CAUTION!!!(kajira):**I just wanted to warn people to be careful.  Wipeout asked me if I wanted to partytoday and then promptly took me to a pk area and tried to kill me.  I was warned itcould happen, so I was ready, but just make note.  And expect bad possibilities ifWipeout asks you to party.  He apparently likes to prey on little unsuspectingpeople, and doesn't even have the courage to make himself officially pk.  Enjoy thegame and I will see you around.Love, Kajira**Wipeout(seleh):**Yeah, he tried this with me also. Very naughty of him to pick onnewbies. Aren't there rules against this? Although I thought therewas hard code to keep anyone under level ..8? from being pk'd.. you never know if he'll run you into a room of agro monsters and whip outsome heals while they do his dirty work.-Seleh**sex(breathless):**Let me know if you want some.**board(thasia):**It'd be nice if you can portal BACK from newbie landsinstead of having them dump you off and make you findyour own way back *crys*~q**Board(disgraceful):**This board will only hold 20 notes.  I wanted to remove my old notenumber 17.  I cannot remove notes.  I will use this space to apologize fortaking up so much space on a 20 note board.  I like having this newbiearea.  It is a great place to hang and read help files without spam.The rooms are a great place to get used to trial and error whether to uselook at or read.  I got a clue here.  I learned here to look for signs.But now I have reached level 5 and my stats are as high as I can go at thislvl so I am moving on to level 6. I'll miss you guys.  Be careful out there.**breathless(guest):**I WANTS SOME SEX. GIVE IT TO ME NOW OR ELSE I WILL SCREW YOU WETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT**shards(crissy):**Hello newbies, just wanted to warn all new players to be careful when partying withsharaks and shard allies.  I'm not going to say they will kill you....but more than likly you will be dead before you can find out.Just a friendly warning.crissy**"
