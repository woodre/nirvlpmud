messages "Guilds(treebeard):**Just as a note to the true newbies.  It is a good idea to figure outpretty early on what guild you want to join.  Some guild have certainrequirements that you can start working towards now, when you are small.If you truely havn't found what you're looking for, then get to lvl 5,and stay there until you max all your stats.  That way you can enjoy nebiebenefits, but still have some power.  just remember though, bigger isn'talways better.  Brain and brawn are useful here.  Have Fun!  Treebeard, the Ent of Doom**Mooching(unseen):**Try not to mooch as much as possible, it will only make you a stronger and more knowledgable character if you do things on your own and see things for yourself.     Thee Unseen**Hey(unseen):**There is a secret to getting newbie levels without fighting. That is extremely quick. Almacide, tis no challenge to those who use their minds and explore.**Board(disgraceful):**This board will only hold 20 notes.  I wanted to remove my old notenumber 17.  I cannot remove notes.  I will use this space to apologize fortaking up so much space on a 20 note board.  I like having this newbiearea.  It is a great place to hang and read help files without spam.The rooms are a great place to get used to trial and error whether to uselook at or read.  I got a clue here.  I learned here to look for signs.But now I have reached level 5 and my stats are as high as I can go at thislvl so I am moving on to level 6. I'll miss you guys.  Be careful out there.**shards(crissy):**Hello newbies, just wanted to warn all new players to be careful when partying withsharaks and shard allies.  I'm not going to say they will kill you....but more than likly you will be dead before you can find out.Just a friendly warning.crissy**couple things(tombsurfer):**If you type mon on, it will show mon while fighting.Also you can get some more coins if you offer corpse.Just couple things to help out.Tombsurfer**Newbies(lanith):**Ok I'd like to write a note for you, true newbies. Its a list ofareas that you should look into fighting in as a newb. First youshould be aware of the traveler in the advance hall. From green3e.s.wask about areasyou will see a list of wizards areas there. Try going to jamilasarea, ask him and he will tell you the directions from the greenor from the church, if its an older area.Trix Realm is good to from newbies, the cathedral is great. Simplygo 6w.2s.w.enter realm.n.portal  and you're in the cathedral. Trykilling some old women and nuns there, and with a few levels and someheals fight the altarboys.Try hawkeyes mash realm too. Simply go 5e.s.enter portal.barracks andfight inside there. the privates, corporals, and sergeants in there shouldbe great for newbs. When in dought use the 'newbie' line.Simply type newbie <message> and hit enter and most of the time another playerwill help you.Be aware that there are 'newbie helpers' on sometimes that will take you outpartying and help you with gear and what not. Besure to read the 'help' filestry: help magic, help spells, help newbie, help actions, help communication,help character, help attribs, help armorsHave fun!**exp(lanith):**remember then you can only use this hall up through level 7. When you arelevel 8 you can't come back here. Once you become 7 remain there and raiseyour stats, str, sta, mag, luc, ste, at least to the max for level 7, which is17once you have these important stats raised then you can break away from being anewbie and start leveling**yeah(kazer):**Newbies listen up. Know your shit, that simple. You should be able to do this as well-->You are now Kazer the small fighter (level 5).age:    9 minutes 44 seconds.I have faith in you.K**Trash(trash):**What do i do**Beware of Krillgeta.(xyzzy):**You have been warned.**areas(unycorn):**These wizards are listed with traveler west of advance hall.Angel (school), Scathe (House of Newbie Horrors),Star (Overlook Hotel), Jamila (Sea Creature).These are to start you off, you can check with him on wizard'sareas.He will also let you know about the different guilds also.So go check with him if want to know about areas.Unycorn**RE: Beware of Krillgeta.(xyzzy)(huhuninnies):**he's actually not good enough on this game to be of any danger. just don't bother trusting himor he might bite your penis off. heh.**Attention All Noobs(wreckage):**Just a word of advice, this room you stand in as you read this, is much moreimportant to you than you probably realize. Just make sure to get it figured outbecause as a newbie this room can be your biggest asset other than your ownfingertips. Peace.Wreckage**Lowbie armor(ghostdog):**Armor shop in bigelow   7e ne n n e read sign cheap armor**Your Daddy(ipfreely):**Ok listen up newbs, I'm your daddy now!MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!**Anyway(jacob):**Anyway, if any of you other newbies need a little help, I'll help when I can. and ignore IPFreely :P**headline(xhex):****question(guest):**how do i join a guild again? =)**oops.(iridis):**Hey, can you remove 21? Thanks.AdriAck dammit.

Sissies.**Healing(thanos):**I'm not sure if anyone else gets the impression that you will heal a little if you are a newbie and in a guild inside this room. Truth is, you don't heal any faster in here than any other room in the mud if you have joined a guild**Go Players(mo):**Go Players located in several bars in, and around the village give out exp for solving problems.  To solve the problem type say play <a,b,c,d, etc> <1,2,3,4,5>.  I will give you a hint: there are three combinations that will award exp.  I started a character and went around to all the go players that I know of in the game and got level 4 without killing a mob.  And after taking the Newbie Quiz, I almost had level 5.Just some friendly advice.-Mo**MERRY CHRISTMAS!(santa):**MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS!**"
