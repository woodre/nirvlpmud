Look at your weapon from time to time.  After the
description you will see how sharp it is.  It begins
'like new' and gets gradually worn.  When it becomes
worn, it is time to sharpen the weapon.

To sharpen your weapon you need to buy a stone from
the Matron in the Warp.  Then unwield the weapon,
sharpen, and wield it again.  To buy a stone go to the 
Warp.
