Goto the castle west of the plains and see Galileo, who is on 
CASTLE/tower_top.  Ask him anything with 'orc tunnels' in it.

You're then teleported to diff world, where you must kill the wraith to
get a feign death scroll.  You must be dead to enter the pedestal room.
Searchin the pedestal you'll get the brass rod.

Goto the orc tunnels, behind the bushes on the mountain, get the stonecutter
from the old prospector and the cloth from the orc captain.  The stonecutter
is to dig a passage, and the cloth tells how to set the trap mechanism.
  If the trap mechanism is not set corectly you will get stuck.
When you find the slab 'insert rod into mechanism' then 'turn rod'.
You will then be able to get the crown.

To get the crown to the elf king, find a rope and grappling hook in the
forest east of the plains.  Tie the rope to grappling hook and 'throw hook'
near the tree.  You then climb up and find the King.

Lastly goto the beach, unfold the boat, place boat, then sail.
Have to fight a mimic of yourself, then search rocks in the next room.

*sigh*

NOTE:  The guards in the castle automatically attack people whose align < 0.
       The last 2 rooms of the quest check for a 'qstob' you get when you
       give the crown to the king. (keep people from teleporting to the
       last part of the quest and waiting til it resets)

       No teleportation commands possible with eleven crown.
       makes trap mechanism more effective.
