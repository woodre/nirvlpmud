     I have been given the job of changing all the quests so that the cheat
sheets floating around do not accurately reflect the solutions.  I try to keep
the intent of the original quest intact and just alter locations of objects
and paths to get to them.  If a an object requires more than an exit change,
I make a copy with an 'E' in front.  I made some object location changes of
some of your items and relocated Galileo as well.  I hope you don't find
this too much of an intrusion.  The changes should be obvious in each dir
as all the new rooms are listed first.  Should you have an questions, please
do not hesitate to contact me.  Thank you for your understand...
