                    WELCOME TO NIRVANA'S SPARRING ARENA

Here you may fight other players with no lose of life. You do not have
to have your player killing set to participate.  No experience will
be gained, this is purely for bragging rights.

A record will be kept of all of the participants won/lose record.
There is also a top ten list so you can see who's the best!

Go to the sparring room south of here and type 'challenge <player>'
The challenged player either accepts or declines your challenge.
You can also abort the challenge by typing 'unlock'.

The challenged player ALWAYS gets the first hit.

PLEASE READ THE RULES FILE!

Any problems, comments, or suggestions mail Molasar
