MOB IDEAS

1) Player Clones
Mob will clone each player in the room and have the clones attack their cloned counterpart



ITEM IDEAS

1) Wand of Courage
Player can cast Courage on target to prevent target from leaving room for a designated time
Courage spell also boosts HPs (code will treat it as an add_hit_point)
Spell lasts 20-30 seconds
Player must wield wand to cast
Player can cast on self, but not other players
Target must be in combat and have less than 50-60% hps (this way, the spell can be coded
  to give back about 25% health)
Wand will have limited charges (5-10)
Courage spell success rate can be associated with Intelligence or Mage levels???



2) Aegis-Fang
Hammer carried by Wulfgar
Make it really heavy
Must be wielded to be used
During combat, player can 'swing hammer' once per heartbeat if wielded 
Player can also 'throw hammer' during combat to stun target NPC removing it from combat
Throw Hammer with no swings may do minor damage to NPC
Throw Hammer with 1 swing will do more damage to NPC
Throw Hammer after 2 swings will do damage and stun NPC (removing it from combat) 
NPC will resume combat since player will keep fighting, OR make NPC stop fighting for 2 heartbeats
Hammer will NOT return to players hand, but player may pick it up from ground and wield again
Throw Hammer after 2 swings will also autokill an NPC at 0/10 just like a derv finishing ability
