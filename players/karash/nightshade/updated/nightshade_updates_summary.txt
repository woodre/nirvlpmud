Nightshade Realm
Updated by Karash (October 2014)

Nightshade's Realm has always been a favorite of mine over the years, yet it does not get 
many visitors anymore, so my goal was to upgrade some of the main NPCs in the realm to
entice players to visit the realm more.

This realm has mobs that follow a Dungeon & Dragons: Forgotten Realms theme, so I selected
11 mobs and researched their abilities within that theme and included many of those 
D&D abilities when upgrading them (as Nightshade intended based on his descriptions).

NOTE: All updated objects will have the original NIGHTSHADE object located in the same
folder with a .bak extension.

All modified and new objects are located in the "/players/karash/nightshade/updated"
directory, with subfolders that will match where they need to go within the nightshade
directory (armor; weap; misc; mons; room).

NOTE: Some of these modified objects still point to some objects in the original 
Nightshade directory which will be good when moved there, but there a lot of paths
within these objects that will need to be corrected once they are moved after testing.


Here is a list of ALL objects that I modified or created by object type (which is also
the name of the folder where the object is located):
(Descriptions of each object are further down.)

OBJECT SUMMARIES (U)-Updated (C)-Created
----------------
ROOM:
1) c27.c (U) 
		- This is the room where Hephaestus the Dragon resides.  
		- Corrected some spelling errors.
2) c28.c (U) 
		- This is the Treasure Room which awards players after they kill the Dragon.
        - Upgraded loot since the Dragon was upgraded.
		- Increased the value of the 4 original gems, Added a wand, Added large pile of coins.
		- Made room No Teleport to prevent players teleporting into treasure room without
		  killing Dragon.
3) capt_room.c (U)
		- This is the room where Cassana the Mage resides.
		- Corrected some spelling errors.
4) guild_row4.c (U)
		- This is the room where the 4 Guildmasters reside.
		- Modified the reset() function to clone guildmasters in a random order when
		  they reset.  Since these NPCs always fight in pairs, different combinations will
		  fight the player depending who the player attacks first, so I wanted to randomize
		  the order they clone in case players have a tendency to attack the first NPC in
		  the room.
		- Added an item to the room for "chest" where all loot for the Masters, not counting
		  what they use in combat, will be found.
		- Added loot for the treasure chest consisting of: Magic Resistance Shield, 
		  Wand of Courage, and lots of coins.
5) shadows_room_new.c (C)
		- This is a room object used to temporarily hold the Master Thief object when he
		  hides in the shadows.  When Master Thief is initially attacked, he will duck into
		  the shadows (this object) for a brief moment before leaping out and backstabbing
		  the attacker.

ARMOR:
1) earcuffs_new.c (C)
		- A loot item dropped from Cassana the Mage.
		- An item for the earring armor slot, which gives 1 AC and ++ bonus to Illusion spells
		  for players in the Mage guild.
2) shield_magresist_new.c (C)
		- A loot item found in the treasure chest in the Guildmasters room.
		- This shield gives 2 AC plus 15% resist to magical attacks: magic, dark & light,
		  good & evil, and mental.
3) shield_natresist_new.c (C)
		- A loot item dropped off Master Fighter in the Guildmasters room.
		- This shield gives 2 AC plus 15% resist to natural attacks: fire, ice, wind, earth,
		  water, poison, electric, and sonic.

WEAP:
1) axe_new.c (C)
		- A loot item dropped from Imp Master.
		- Imp Master's attack mentioned an axe, so I created one to drop.  
		- 10 WC with an additional 5 WC poison damage to go with the theme of imps using poison.
2) hammer.c (U)
		- The legendary Aegis-fang dropped by Wulfgar, the barbarian.
		- Since Wulfgar was upgraded, it seemed logical to upgrade his legendary hammer. So,
		  after research of the hammer used in Forgotten Realms, I gave this hammer a throwing
		  ability that can do heavy damage when a player uses it.
		- A player must have STR20 to wield this.  A player must use this weapon in combat to
		  make it "Attuned" in order for it to do extra damage.  When fighting, a player can
		  "swing hammer" to prepare a throw and after swinging for 2 rounds, the player can
		  "throw hammer" at his target.  
		- When thrown, if hammer is not attuned, it will only do normal damage. 
		- When thrown, if hammer is attuned, it will do 100 dmg, unless target is at 0/10, then
		  hammer will do 500 dmg (which follows the theme of the Aegis-fang as a finishing
		  weapon).
3) holy_mace_new.c (C)
		- A loot item dropped from Master Cleric in the Guildmasters room since the original
		  mob did not have any items on it.
		- This is a mace weapon to follow the theme of the cleric which does half physical
  		  damage and half holy (good) damage.
4) invis_sword.c (U)
		- An invisible object on the original Master Mage used to simulate mage spells.
		- Corrected some spelling errors.
		- Also, on the Master Mage object, added code to destruct this object when Mage died.
5) poison_dagger_new.c (C)
		- A loot item dropped from Master Thief in the Guildmasters room since the original
		  mob did not have any items on it.
		- To follow the theme of the Thief, this is a dagger that does physical and poison
		  damage.  The Thief clones 2 of these to dual wield.

MISC:
1) black_opal.c (U)
2) moonstone.c (U)
3) onyx.c (U)
4) topaz.c (U)
		- The Black Opal, Moonstone, Onyx, and Topaz were gems located in the original treasure
		  room after killing the Dragon.  Since the treasure was upgraded after upgrading the
		  Dragon, I increased the value of these gems and added color to their names.
5) courage_obj_new.c (C)
6) courage_wand_new.c (C)
		- The Wand of Courage is found in the treasure chest in the Guildmasters room.
		- This wand is usable by players to cast on a mob to prevent fleeing, but it has a
		  drawback that it also heals the target when cast.
		- If the target is less than 80% health, a player may "encourage target" which will
		  heal the target 20% or 1000HP, whichever is less, giving the target the courage to
		  continue fighting (without fleeing).
		- This wand cannot be cast on players, has 10 charges, and it cannot be stored.
		- The courage_obj_new.c is the object placed on the target to prevent it from fleeing
		  while the spell is in effect.
7) frenzy_obj_new.c (C)
8) frenzy_wand_new.c (C)
		- The Wand of Frenzy is found in the treasure room after killing the Dragon.
		- This wand is usable by players to cast on a mob to prevent fleeing, but it has a
		  drawback that it boosts the damage of the target for the duration of the spell.
		- A player may "enrage target" which will add damage each round equal to 40% of the 
		  target's base WC, thus giving the target the rage to continue fighting (without fleeing).
		- This wand cannot be cast on players, has 10 charges, and it cannot be stored.
		- The frenzy_obj_new.c is the object placed on the target to prevent it from fleeing
		  and boosting damage output while the spell is in effect.
9) holy_symbol_new.c (C)
		- A loot item dropped from Master Cleric to follow the theme of the cleric.
10) mirror_new.c (C)
		- A loot item dropped from Master Mage to follow the theme of the mage illusionist.
		- This item duplicates the platinum mirror used by the mage guild to cast mirror 
		  image.  Since the mage mirror is configured when cloned, I just created an object
		  to clone a mirror that matches the configuration of the mage component.
11) nomelee_obj_new.c (C)
		- An object placed on a player when Hephaestus the Dragon takes flight, which 
		  prevents weapon attacks by the player, thus giving the perception that they 
		  cannot reach a flying mob with melee attacks.
12) paralyze_obj_new.c (C)
		- An object placed on a player when the Basilisk uses a gaze attack and paralyzes
		  the player, thus freezing the player from performing any actions and stopping
		  weapon attacks.
13) parry_obj_new.c (C)
		- An object placed on a player when fighting the Master Fighter and he performs a
		  Parry.  Basically, this object will prevent a weapon attack giving the perception
		  that the Master Fighter parried the attack.
14) poison_obj_new.c (C)
		- An object placed on a player when fighting the Master Thief and he performs a
		  Backstab to poison the player.  This object will hurt the player for a few rounds
		  to give the perception that the player is Poisoned.
15) stun_obj_new.c (C)
		- An object placed on a player when fighting Wulfgar and he stuns the player
		  when throwing his hammer.  This object will prevent all actions and weapon attacks
		  giving the perception that the player is Stunned.

   Abilities: 
 *          This is one of four guildmasters, including a Cleric, Fighter, Mage and Thief.
 *          They are all located in the same room and coded to fight in pairs, meaning
 *          when one is attacked, there is a progression that dictates one of the 
 *          other Masters will join the fight to help (depending on which Master is
 *          attacked and who is remaining in the room).  Two Masters will always fight
 *          at the same time, unless players directly attack more than two.
 *
 *          The Cleric has the ability to cast spells on players consisting of Physical
 *          and Good (Holy) damage, plus a mace that does both damage types.
 *          If the Cleric is fighting, the Cleric will heal all Masters in combat three
 *          times (including himself), which will increase the hp_bonus of the target
 *          each time a heal is cast.
 *
 *          The only loot on the Guildmasters will be what they use to fight.  All other
 *          loot for the combined Masters will be found in a chest in the room, so 
 *          players must kill all Masters to get the combined loot.

 *
 *          The Fighter has a few more HPS and carries a Resistance Shield that has some
 *          resistance to all natural damage types.  The Fighter also has the ability to
 *          Parry Attacks (prevent damage), Cleave (hit all attackers) and make Critical
 *          Hits for heavy damage.  Also, if the Fighter is in combat, he will taunt
 *          every attacker in the room to draw their attack, which may allow other 
 *          Masters to perform their special abilities if they are fighting and not 
 *          being directly attacked (such as the Thief's Backstab).
 *
 *          The only loot on the Guildmasters will be what they use to fight.  All other

   Abilities:
 *          This is one of four guildmasters, including a Cleric, Fighter, Mage and Thief.
 *          They are all located in the same room and coded to fight in pairs, meaning
 *          when one is attacked, there is a progression that dictates one of the

 *          at the same time, unless players directly attack more than two.
 *
 *           The Thief has a little less HPS, but can do more damage, especially if no
 *          attackers are directly attacking him.  If he is initially attacked, he will
 *          duck into the shadows and emerge with a Backstab on the attacker, doing heavy
 *          damage and poisoning his target for damage over time.  
 *           If thief is fighting, he will continue to Backstab and Poison if no attacker
 *          is directly attacking him (meaning if an attacker focuses on him, he cannot
 *          duck into the shadows to perform his backstab).
 *           Also, if Thief is fighting and his direct target is not focused on him, he will
 *          perform extra damage to his target as a Sneak Attack (the Fighter's taunt
 *          helps the Thief greatly).
 *           Lastly, the Thief has Evasion, which gives him a 50% chance to take 50% less
 *          damage of any type each round for each attack.  
 *           Thief carries dual daggers that can do some poison damage.
 *
 *          The only loot on the Guildmasters will be what they use to fight.  All other
 *          loot for the combined Masters will be found in a chest in the room, so 
 *          players must kill all Masters to get the combined loot.

 *          at the same time, unless players directly attack more than two.
 *
 *           The Mage has a little less HPs than the other Masters.  The Mage's
 *          role is to stand in the back and blast attackers with lightning (electric
 *          damage).  When the Mage enters combat, he will conjure a lightning elemental
 *          to assist in the fight, which also causes electric damage and will taunt
 *          attackers off the Mage and Thief if the Fighter is not present and fighting.
 *

   Estimated Exp: ~196,000
   
   Loot Value: 11,000
		- Mirror = 5000
		- Earcuffs = 1300
		- Cleaver = 10,000
		- Armor = 1000
		- Cloak = 500
		- Shield = 500
		- Coins = 2000
		NOTE: The Cleaver was part of the original loot on this mob and is overvalued compared
		      to it's damage output, but instead of modifying the object, I left it as it is
			  since players cannot sell it for much more than 1000gp anyway.
		
   Abilities:
 *		    When the object called captain.c is attacked, it will destruct and 
 *          create 3 clones of the object called captain2_new.c where one of the clones
 *			will randomly be set as the real captain and the other 2 will be set as mirror
 *			images. All 3 captains will attack the attacker, but only the real captain will
 *          reward experience for the kill.  Therefore, all bonuses from the 2
 *          images are set in the cloned object for the real captain.
 *
 *          As a level 25 mob, this mob will  have a spell attack and the 2 special
 *          advantages will be 1) since all 3 images attack, it is very similar to
 *          multicast with 3 spells and 2) there is a 2:3 chance the attacker will kill
 *          an image and will have to fight again to get exp from the real captain.
 *          NOTE: The second (and possibly third) fight is not included in the exp
