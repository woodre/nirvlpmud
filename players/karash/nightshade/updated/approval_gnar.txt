Weapons
-------------------------
axe_new.c 
  -OK, weapon_hit to clone the poison obj would be cool, although it would have to be rare.
==>KARASH: Yes, it would be cool, but I don't think this is the place for additional poision damage.
		I don't see anyone using this axe just for a rare chance to poison the target.  Plus, see
		comments I made for the Imp Master below.  He's kind of tough already.
		
hammer.c 
  -Change non-fatal hit to 70-80 dmg.  Should be 2 handed weapon with weight of 4?
==>KARASH: I changed the non-fatal hit to 80 dmg, but I don't want to go any lower.  I wanted this 
		damage to be significant damage (like a powerful spell) since the wielder goes through enough
		trouble with attunement and swinging the hammer that he should be rewarded for it.
		Also, I initially was going to make this a heavy 2-handed weapon as a drawback to its ability,
		but the actual Aegis-fang is a 1-handed warhammer, so I made it 1-handed and left the weight
		as a drawback to using it.  However, once we added the attunement requirement, it doesn't need
		the extra weight drawback, so I will drop the weight to 3 to match the cleric's mace.
		
holy_mace_new.c
  -OK
invis_sword.c
  -OK
poison_dagger_new.c
  -OK
  
Armor
--------------------------
earcuffs_new.c
  -OK
  
shield_magresist_new.c
  -change resistances to 2. An armor special could temporarily raise them to 15
==>KARASH: I lowered the resistances for both shields to 2 for all resistances.  I'm not sure I understand
		how the armor special works to temporarily raise resistances.  Reading the documentation, it seems
		the set_special for armors is only for physical damage.  So, avoiding having to develop some complex
		code to do a temporary increase, I'll just leave it like it is.
		
shield_natresist_new.c
  -same as magic shield.
==>KARASH: See comment on magic shield.
  
Misc
--------------------------
black_opal.c
  -OK
courage_obj_new.c
  -OK

courage_wand_new.c
  - 3-5 charges or randomize 10 charges. Can reduce heal to 10% of you want. Increase value per charge accordingly. Or change mob
    mobs to load only once per boot.
==>KARASH: Well, I'd like to keep these wands like they are.  I see these wands being used exclusively for OPL
		(which was the reason they were really created) if they are used at all.  The idea was to give them 
		enough charges to make it beneficial to carry deep into OPL and not run out of charges.  To justify
		the number of charges and to avoid being a better option to replace having a member of a guild who can
		freeze mobs, I wanted a drawback large enough to consider finding a player to cast freeze over using
		these wands.  This is why there is a 20% heal (or 1000 HP) on the courage wand and a 40% damage bonus
		on the frenzy wand.  Honestly, the 40% may seem high, but since it is calculated from base WC and uses
		hit_player to do physical damage, any player with average gear doesn't actually take much damage.  Through
		testing, I determined that anything less than 40% base WC becomes insignificant damage to the player and
		doesn't do enough extra damage to be considered a drawback to using the wand.  
		CONCLUSION: I put a LOT of thought into these wands as you can see and would like to keep the wands
		as they are, with 10 charges and the larger drawbacks.
UPDATE: Changing both wands to 5 charges, per approval comments.

frenzy_obj_new.c
  - Same as courage wand. 40% dmg penalty seems high, can reduce if desired.
==>KARASH: See comments on the courage wand.

holy_symbol_new.c
  -OK
mirror_new.c
  -OK
moonstone.c
  -OK
nomelee_obj_new.c
  -OK
onyx.c
  -OK
paralyze_obj_new.c
  -OK
parry_obj_new.c
  -OK
  
poison_obj_new.c
  -OK, add room message?
==>KARASH: The room message is on the Thief who announces who has been poisoned when he backstabs.
  
stun_obj_new.c
  -OK
topaz.c
  -OK
  
Rooms
-----------------------
  -OK since just fixing typos etc.
  
Mons
-----------------------
basilisk.c
  -Level 25 requires 2 specials, paralyze is 1, needs another. Best to list these in the header.
  -Suggestion, poison?
  -Max coins for level 25 is 11,000, coins are slightly over currently
==>KARASH: I intended the 2nd special to be that this mob will cast a spell EVERY round doing a decent
		amount of damage, which really hurts when the player is paralyzed and cannot heal.  Plus, this 
		mob has a higher than usual AC.  So, judging by my testing, I think increasing damage with poison
		would be too much.  I added comments to the header stating this.
  
captain2_new.c
  -I'll update the value of the cleaver when we move everything over.
captain.c
  -Optional: Not sure why we need 2 copies of the same mob? Understand that 1 is the real one and the other is the mirror.
   I would think the room could clone 3 of the same file and set the flags to know which is which. A lot of the code
   is duplicated in the files. If you want to have 2 files to make it cleaner maybe you should inherit from the other so
   all of the code can be in a single file. Just yell if you need help with this, should not be a lot of rework, let me
   know if I am wrong.
==>KARASH: The captain.c object is just a placeholder mob to hold the code to clone the 3 true mobs.  I did not want this
		code to be dependant on the room to clone the 3 mobs, so I'm using this object to initiate the encounter.  The
		only duplicated code with the captain2_new.c object is in the reset, which I duplicated in this object to match 
		the actual mob stats that will be cloned to allow any guild abilities that can stat a mob to be accurate to the
		player checking to see how tough the mobs will be when they are cloned (I did not want to undermine those guild
		abilities).  I see both objects also have a 'calm room' function, but that's the only other similarity in the code.
		
		   The reason for the second object is that my preference was to separate the code that interacted with the
		players with the code that cloned the actual mobs.  So, the captain2_new.c object is the actual mob code that
		clones both the 'real' and 'image' mobs initiated by the captain.c code.  The captain2_new.c object holds the
		code for combat interaction, monster death code, and the loot.
		
		   So, it is NOT that one object is the 'real' mob and one is the 'image' mob, instead, the captain.c object is 
		is the code to clone the captain2_new.c mob, which is the actual mob code and can be set to either 'real' or 
		'image' when cloned.  I'd like to keep these objects like they are instead of trying to combine all of this into
		one consolidated object that technically serves two purposes.
   
cyclo.c
  -OK

hook_horror.c
  -OK, can up coins if we reduce the armor value which is nothing special
==>KARASH: Yes, I was just avoiding having to modify another original file.  
		Anyway, I changed the value of the hook_plate.c from 4000 to 2000 and increased coins for the 
		hook horror by 2000 coins.
  
imp_master.c
  -OK, why not use the poison_obj here? In fact adding suggestion to the axe to call this obj as well.
==>KARASH: The imp master was intended by Nightshade to be a basic tough mob that guarded the newbie area with very high
		HP and high AC.  I made it level 22, but I left more than twice the required HP, I made half its WC as 
		non-physical damage (other|poison), gave it heal 5 each round, gave it resist 20, and it still does 100 damage
		each round like the original.  I figured that adding an additional poison function would be too much and would
		require increasing its level, making it more of a staple mob, which is not what this mob is intended to be.
		Therefore, I appreciate the suggestion, but I'd like to keep it as it is.
  
kargile.c
  -Level 25 requires 2 specials, stun is 1, needs 1 more.
  -Second special idea - have him use the hammers throw command when the player gets below 100 hps! Could manually set
    the required variables in the weapon so it would work, would be very cool effect.
==>KARASH: I intended the 2nd special to be covered by the heavy damage spells that have an 80% chance of occurring each
		round, including one spell that hits ALL attackers.  I thought about using the hammer's abilities, but, at the 
		time, I chose not to introduce code to the hammer that was specific to Wulfgar to bypass all the player checks
		already coded.
		   If you feel he still needs another special, I'll look into it, but he's already pretty tough.  I'll add a 
		comment to the header regarding specials.
		
ltng_elemental_new.c
  -OK
master_cleric.c
   -OK
  -Ignoring specials for the masters, since they force you to fight more than 1 and coordinate efforts, and each
   has at least 1 special attack.
master_fighter.c
   -OK
master_mage.c
  -OK
red_dragon.c
  -OK
master_thief.c
  -OK
  
Suggestions
-----------------
I continue to be very impressed with your code for the amount of experience that you have.  You make it very easy
on me to do your approvals. Your unique mobs/objects really add something to the game, and you really push the
boundaries of what you've done before. I'd say one thing to try and focus on is creating functions when
you have similar code in multiple places. For example in the cleric where he heals the other masters, you have
a function for each one. This could be a function that maybe you pass the object to to heal it. The code in your
masters heartbeat, although I did not look closely, I think there are most likely places there that could be combined.
Or maybe you should even have a master mob that inherits from monster.c, and each master type inherits from your master
npc. Same with the captain, the mirror and the real mob are essentially the same, and I think they could be combined.
This are obviously not required for approval, but things to look for as you go on to the next project.
Again, a great job, I am especially excited to try out the dragon, he is very unique (masters a close second).
Congrats

==>KARASH: I appreciate the comments.  I must have a good teacher.
