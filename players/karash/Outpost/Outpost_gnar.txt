so05
  - Need following items added:
     - From path:
        ground
        prints
    - From buildings:
        solar panels
        satellite dishes
    - doors
  - Just a suggestion, add an action to the room that adds a message to the room about the automatic doors
    when the player leaves to the n or s. ASCII would be cool
  - Guards are pretty spammy when both are in the room
  - Guards not meant to prevent player from entering?
==> KARASH: 
	(1) I added descriptions for all items, plus also added descriptions for
		building, panels, dishes, door, automatic door, automatic doors
	(2) I added an action to ANY room object where you ENTERED or EXITED a building in the compound
	(3) Lowered the set_chat_chance for Guard from 10 to 3 (2 guards in one room were very chatty)
	(4) Yes, the guards were initially NOT meant to prevent a player from entering the main
		building since the Commander will welcome any volunteers he can find to fight.  However
		I changed it to make the guards stop you on their own terms b/c they are not happy 
		with being stationed in the compound and wish to be the next soldiers through the slipgate.
		You must now remove the guards to enter the main building.

Mobs
-------
a_carmack.c - Good

t_hall.c
  - Not sure I understand the point of the bitch_slapped function being called from
    the spell. It looks like the room will get two messages for the spell, and
    the spell has an 80% fire rate. I'd suggest lowering the % and increasing the
    damage a bit, then doing the second message from the function only when the
    damage is close to the max amount.
==> KARASH: I did this on purpose.  Initially, I was doing this to learn how to call a
	function from the add_spell, but I decided to keep it the way it was.
	I like the two messages for the spell because one is a vocal response and one is 
	an attack action.  (1) The vocal chat is a humorous nod to John Romero's infamous Daikatana
	Advertisement that simply stated "John Romero will make you his bitch!", which turned
	off a lot of his fans, especially after the game bombed.  I even listed
	that statement twice in the 3 statements found in the chat chance to give it more
	probability to show. (2) The 'bitchslap' action from the called function is simply the
	attack from this NPC.  Since this NPC has no weapon, I made the damage low, but with
	a high % almost as if the NPC is flailing his arms trying to slap his attacker. I also
	wanted a high percentage to serve as an insult to the attacker - heh.
	If it's still a problem, let me know.
	NOTE: Okay, I raised the damage needed to call the function statement on the second message from 1 to 9 (out of 10).
	
guard.c - Good
s_petersen.c - Good
a_mcgee.c - Good 

keen.c 
  - Where is the GB packers helmet for armor?!
  - I think you should drop the % of spells firing and increase damage.
  - He needs 1 more special ability for this level
==> KARASH:
	(1) Created a GB Packers helmet and NPC's favorite tshirt for the NPC.
	(2) Changed Spell 1 from 50% 20-30dmg to 40% 40-60dmg.
		Changed Spell 2 from 40% 30-40dmg to 40% 40-60dmg.
		-- I only lowered the percentage of spell 1 a little, but doubled the damage
		-- I kept the percentage on spell 2 the same, but raised the damage by 50% at max
		I did not lower the percentage of this spell because it hits ALL attackers, which
		serves as one of the NPC's 'special abilities'.
	(3) The second spell has a decent percentage chance to hit ALL attackers.  This was
	  meant to meet one of the NPC's 'special abilities', so I did raise the damage a little
	  as I mentioned above.  So, 2 special abilites are multicast and all-attacker spell.
	  Does this meet the requirements?

j_carmack.c - Good

romero.c - Good
  - Had issue with catch_tell with the dark order guild obj on me
  - Suggestion, add to the message something about John empowering his daikatana when switching to crit.
==> KARASH:
	(1) This issue is now fixed with Dragnar's help.  The sscanf function was not recognizing
	  the speech when it was in color, so we added a remove_color function to the string variable
	  and it works now.  I added the remove_color function to romero, romero the proud and romero the crit.
	(2) Added message about empowering sword to romero.c
  
romero_proud.c 
  - Again I think you should drop the % of spells firing and increase damage.
    This keeps the fight a bit less predictable even though multi cast is on
  - He needs 1 more special ability for this level
==> KARASH:
	(1) I only dropped the % of spell chance slightly (from 40% to 35%), but If
	  doubled the damage range (from 20-30dmg to 40-60dmg).  I wanted the chance
	  of multicast to say about the same.
	(2) First Special Ability = Multicast; Second Special Ability = Calm_Room
	  At two points during the combat, Romero Proud will calm the room to stop all fighting (around 6/10
	  and 3/10).  I also raised the mob's self heal from 10hp/heartbeat to 15hp/heartbeat.  After the
	  mob calms the room, he gives the attacker a book written about him as a distraction to the attacker
	  while the mob self-heals a little.  If the mob reaches max hps, the counter to stop the fight will
	  reset to calm another 2 times during combat.  This ability allows the mob to get a little extra
	  healing during the fight, plus it will disrupt certain attacker abilities like the Mage's mimage
	  or the Ranger's dust that changes alignment.
  
romero_crit.c
  - Same theme for spells, lower % and increase dam. Spells should be in the
    60+ range for a mob this level, even with multicast on. If you wanted you
    could remove spells or reduce spell dam while shield is active?
  - Coin limit for level 28 is 23k, but he clearly meets requirements for level 29
    so you can bump level to 29 to increase max of 30k coins
  - Emp daikatana is valued at 23k which must be included in the mobs value. However
    the weapon only heals 150, and doesn't store, so I think you could drop the
    value of this wep to 5k which would require lowering gold a bit. You can
    either increase heal amount to make the weapon more valuable and lower coins,
    or keep wep as is, lower value of wep, and only lower coins a bit to stay under 30k.
==> KARASH:
	(1) Lowered the % chance for spells from 40% to 25% and 
	  almost tripled damage of spells from 20-30dmg to 55-75dmg.
	(2) Raised NPC level to level 29.
	(3) Raised the heal value of healing charges from 45hp/45sp to 95hp/95sp.  By
	  multiplying this non-tox heal by 60 coins per hp (285 hps), the value of this healing
	  item should be about 17,100 coins.  Changing value of Daikatana (empowered)
	  from 23000 to 17500 coins.  Note that item only has 3 charges and does NOT store.
	(4) Changed the coins dropped from NPC from 23000+random(10000) to
	  10000+random(5000).  This gives an average of 12500, plus the 17500 value
	  of the item dropped, which makes total dropped value of 30000 coins (level 29 coin amt).
	  
	
fanboy.c - Good

  
Note: 3500 coins can be 2000 + random(3000) but nice when they are not always max
==> KARASH: Noted.

All good, only comments on daikatana value noted under romero_crit.c

General Feedback
-----------------
  - Very nice job Karash
    - Headers done, comments added, easy to read code, nice overview
    - Rooms well done with descriptions and items, grammar (coming from me take that for whatever it is worth)
    - Well done theme with nice humor adding to it, setup will for future areas
    - Obvious that you took the time to understand the base objects like monster.c and use the
      functions available from those objects.
    - Nice that your mobs don't all have max coins and gear isn't all 100% pushing limits, while your
      bigger mobs are still interesting and different from anything else.
    - Tied up a lot of lose ends I would not expect from a wizards first area, good example is resetting
      John romero during room reset but still knowing to ensure he wasn't engaged in combat.
