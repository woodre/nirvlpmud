PK only area:
	- All players in this area must have flag set, followers/partyers must have flag set too.
	- If someone doesn't have their flag set, they should be attacked by mobs and they should not survive.

Museum type area:

	- Not sure on the theme, but could maybe clone guild objects on different mobs and so killing mobs will be like PKing different guilds

Each mob has a unique prize:

	-equipment, heals, random obs, etc.  No coins.

Kills worth 200,000 to 1,000,000 exp

	- this will be dependent on the guild and how good they are at PK (ie- healers, bards -> 200k, cybers, samurai -> 1mil
