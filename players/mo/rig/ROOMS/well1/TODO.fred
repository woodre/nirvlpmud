You shouldn't use "you" in room descriptions.  Be more general.
Instead of You area able to walk around.  Use Workers are able to walk around.
Instead of Directly in front of you.  Use Directley ahead a large panel etc.


Looks like in each room in the long desc. surprising should be surprisingly clean.
