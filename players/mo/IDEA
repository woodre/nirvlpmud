Oil rigs off the coast in a spot in Hirandea, reached by helicopter.
Gold mine(s) on the side of a mountain in Hirandea.
I need a helicopter that is similar to the John Deere Tractor in Beck's area.
I need to figure out how to make it so people can't access the Oil Rig if the Helicopter is not present.
I need to figure out how to make it so the Helicopter takes 5-6 seconds to fly to the rig.
I need to figure out how to create an action for people to mine gold from the mine.
MOBS: Roughnecks, Toolhands, Drillers, Geologists near the wells.  Operations team leader, Operations coordinator, control room operator, and crane operators in the Control Center.  Offshore operators engineer, pilot, and offshore installation manager in the offshore office.  
WEPS: Crescent wrench, pipes.
OBJ: Wallets with money for control center crew, clipboards, hard hats, reflective gear for geologists, and steel-toed boots and hard hats for roughnecks etc.  Heals for cooks in the galley.
Lifts will down you up and down. Down is probably going to be living quarters (bedrooms, bathrooms, and rec facilities).  Up will be walkways to access the upper portions of the wells.
