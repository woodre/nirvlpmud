messages "Guild Procedure(constantine):**'Allo again.I was thinkin today and the thing that I was thinkin is that we should get down a few guild rules before we officially open, you know?Like,   1) Admittence of new members (that is, who 'as say in who gets in?)  2) A bigger guild 'all, perhaps even a guild store / pub / what 'ave you  3) More contributions from players / members on our guild  4) Guild protocol and politics  5) ??? (who knows? The mind bloody boggles)Yours with a smirk,John.PS = It wouldn't hurt for Bastion to post replies on this board, so the working class joe like me knows 'is ideas are getting processed somewhere.**Processing...*beep*(bastion):**As I told the three of you already, new members would have to be approved by the existing membership and admitted by the guild master. As for a bigger guild hall: That will happen when I finish all theses nasty little spells. A guild pub is practically useless though since you cannot get adiscount, and there is a perfectly fine pub right in limbo.The only politics I forsee (what a fool am I) is electing the guild master.Since he's the only one who can admit new members and gets all the spells,it's not a bad positition to have. (You can also make your own title...)Have fun!**Guild Master Elections??(constantine):**Cheers, mates.I hereby nominate meself for the position of guildmaster. I may be onlysmall potatos now, but I have plans. Anyway, enough from me. Let's get on with it. And remember, a vote for John Constantine is a vote for John Constantine.YoursJohn.**There's always me..(alustryx):**Hey, how about making me the Guild Master!  I should be back in... someday.I know, first you all vote me back in, then vote me as Guild Master!<smile>Never quite forgotten....Alustryx**Our bare guild(bastion):**Please make sure to harrass Myste if you think the guild needs some decorating. I'll just try and wait patiently...*yawn***And then there were 2...(constantine):**Well now...It seems as though Myste and I have our own personal guild... How nice.My complements to Bastion for building us our own guild hall and spellsjust for us... I think I speak for both of us when I say we're flattered.      Cheerio,      John.**"
