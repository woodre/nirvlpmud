New newbie gear

In order to help newbies on nirvana with leveling, I propose that we increase
affectiveness of newbie gear. We can do this by adding a few minor specials
to existing newbie gear, and enhance it with color. The following is a list
of ideas I have to change newbie gear.

1. Add a newbie shield to newbie gear in hall.
2. Add color to new and existing newbie gear.
3. Add minor specials to newbie gear to help newbies.
4. Add a newbie pet.
5. Increase the affectiveness of green and blue gels for newbie healing.
6. have a better newbie bag.
7. Add an instructional special to newbie sword that emotes common concepts
   hints and great places to fight, while using the newbie weapon.
8. Add extra gold to newbie test.
