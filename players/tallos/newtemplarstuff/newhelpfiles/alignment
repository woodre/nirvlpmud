-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------    

    Each player starts with an alignment of neutral. From there
depending on the monsters(or players) you kill, your alignment
will sway from good or evil, or if you find a balance will stay
neutral.  By killing monsters that are considered good you will
make yourself evil, and vice-versa. 
	You will be unable to see the alignment of other players
without the ability to detect alignment. These abilities/spells
are most likely avaible through guild powers or magic items.

(NOTE: It is best to fight the monsters that oppose your current
       alignment, with neutrals benefiting from killing either.)
