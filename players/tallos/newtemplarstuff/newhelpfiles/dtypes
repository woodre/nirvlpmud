    There are several different types of damage on nirvana. From
evil, to earth, good, air, wind, fire etc. All spells, and some
magical items use these damage types.

Rosenthal Wizardkind now offers a new service at the
Village Magic Shop; for only 3000 coins, he can reveal
to you some special properties about your equipment
(most importantly, damage types).

For example: 'identify <armor>' will return the information he
knows about that armor piece.

You can do the same for any weapon as well.
