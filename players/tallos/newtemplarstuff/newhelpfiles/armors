 In addition to these armors you can wear other "none" sloted items
which will also display on your 'armors' list. These items are rare
and usually don't give any armor bonus, but do sometimes provide
special powers and abilities. 

You may never wear more then 1 of the same type of armor. So you
could not wear 2 Rings of Pain, for example. You would have to find
another ring of a different name. The same goes for earrings.
