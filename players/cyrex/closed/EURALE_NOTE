  I am in the process of changing quests so that the cheat sheets that
are out there do not accurately reflect the solutions.  I have done
some changing to yours and finished 3/30/97.  Specifially, I've done
the following things:
  *I added an access card to the assistant in ~/hire/level4.c
  *I made a duplicate room of ~/tunnel.c and called it ~/Etunnel.c
  *instead of 'touch light' they must now 'insert card'
  *I moved the location of entry to the ~/quest/shockroom from
     ~/quest/hive12.c to hive1.c
The rest of the quest was left basically intact but will require a
redo to find the  appropriate combos.
