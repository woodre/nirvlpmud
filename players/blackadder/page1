TRUMP CARDS:  A brief history with instructions.
 
Trump cards are a clever means of travel devised by the Blackadder
family to allow travel among many different dimensional planes.
The Blackadders have evolved their magic beyond the actual need for
the cards in recent times, but they are still used as a means of
communication among family members.
 
The scene or person depicted on the face of the card gives a good
indication as to where you might end up if you use the card.
To use a card simply examine the scene on the card and enter the
word 'trump' followed by the destination.  For example if the 
card depicted a church then you would type 'trump church' to be
transported there.
 
Trumps may also be used to contact individuals depicted on their
faces and send messages to them.  They can also be used to summon the
individual or to drop in unexpectedly on them.  To contact someone
type 'contact <name> <message>', to spy type 'spy <name>', to summon
type 'summon <name>, and to trump to thier location type 'trump <name>'.
 
Trumps can be very useful, they can also be very dangerous.  Use
them carefully.
