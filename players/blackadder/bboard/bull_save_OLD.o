tmp_text "Welcome to my home.  This board should be used to report bugs or to givefeedback on things found within this castle.  I will try to address allof your inquiries and suggestions promptly.  This board is also a forumfor suggestions on things that you (the player) would like to see in thegame (eg.  new objects, weapons, magical devices, etc...)  Also I am looking into creating new worlds which you may trump to and any suggestions on locales would be appreciated. Have fun,  Blackadder**The 'search command has been implemented throughout the castle and any otherworlds I may create.  At the moment there are not too many hidden itemsbut that will change shortly.   Blackadder**You may now sell corpses for 50 coins each at the morgue.  It islocated east of the blackadder boutique.  Blackadder**I really like this place.  Melissa is a totally new idea, and a good one too.  gotta go..just sobered up..keep up the new and good work**Just for courisoty(spelled wrong) I was wondering hohow many hp the knight has......I like him....good stuff to kill for and good exp##**How about a magic potion in your machine to make your sp accelerate with other stuff????**could you please put a sign up warrning people thattea is for level 10 char and up only**Thanks for the advice and help...in your new areamaybe you could make a seeing ring which when you picked it upit forced you to name a player....and that is the player that the ringwould allow you to spy....that would be helpful for two people workingtogather.....just an idea.....**     Turk:  you can buy a trump of a person in my drawing room.  This incorporates that function already. Read the book in my study for further details.                               - Blackadder**How about makinga weaponthat had,say,a 50percentchanceof saying`TheBladeGoesSnicker-Snackerand DecapitatesYourFoe.`(whenit saidthatit would take 10,000,000hitpointsfrom your opponent.Oh...by the way...make the price 60001 with no installment plans...Predator.**I really wish I could do more with your consort....I tried to search melissa, enter melissa, and other assorted verbs.Or does she only have eyes for you?** Wow.

Thought I would just let you know.Xenon Xris**The header says it all.  Summon will still not work, however.**When you type 'search' in the Armory Vault (after the Shining Knight), youget a 'What ?'.  I guess it wasn't programmed in...Nikodaemus Soulwind, Master of the Dark Arts**In a Party, while using Party Follow, leaving the castle screws it uptoggling follow on and off does nothing... follow can't be used...a new team must be formed...It is a little irritating ;)Nikodaemus Soulwind, Master of the Dark Arts**I think that the trumpsw should get that 'summon' function up.I know I've tried using it, and it just wouldn't work.  *sigh*****I have a cunning plan!Prince: SAUSAGE TIME!!!  :)  What a great show....Mordred****i think melissa was a good fuckfrom strawberry the allmighty creature**Hi Blackadder! I have an idea that you might be interested in:            ANTI-TRUMPS!!!!!!!!!That's right, anti-trumps, the newest rage! (or will be if you make them)What about Anti-trump cards that you can carry so that people CAN'Ttrump to you? I know that certain dubious characters take great delight ingetting a trump card of you then go out looking for blood. They just keep trumping to you, keep trying to kill you, and are a general pain in theback-side.  So what do you think? You could have a profits go towardshelping knock-kneed, deaf gnomes, or some such thing....That didn't make much sense, did it? Oh well. Just a thought,            Xris the Plunderer (and pillager on occasion)**BTW, the years covered on this board are 1991-1992. It's 1994 right now.**mebbe someone should clear this board?**...This is HISTORY man! Wha? Wha? Wha?*grin***0**0**0**0**0**"
