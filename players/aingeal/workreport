8/9/04:  Charm lost all her autoloads upon logging in.  Hogath restored her
ring, and I restored her miniguilds (succubus and feline).  The succubus
object double-cloned, but we got it straightened out.  This is an odd
bug (it's happened to Feyth a few times too), but so far, we have
no idea what's causing it to crop up every so often.  Thankfully,
it's rare.

Finn logged in yesterday, killed a mob, then lost his heartbeat.  Not knowing
what to do, he then stored his gear in Casa, room 433, and got a 'sensitive mind'
error message.  He did not see any of his gear in the room, assumed that it stored
correctly, and logged out.  When he logged back in today, his gear did not clone 
correctly when he tried to retrieve it.  After talking with him about this, and knowing
that Casa has eaten equipment in the same way before on several occasions regarding
several different players, I restored what he reported as lost.  I restored the following:
"black ring from chess"   /players/eurale/Chess/OBJ/tshield.c
"shield from chess"   /players/eurale/Chess/OBJ/tshield.c
"riding boots from phantasm"  /players/eurale/Dis/rooms/OBJ/boots.c
"sword from phantasm"  /players/eurale/Dis/Hood/OBJ/bsword.c
"ball from ashgan"  /players/coldwind/desert/weapons/ball.c
"sword from dhana desert quest"   /players/coldwind/desert/weapons/sword.c
"amulet of protection"  finn /players/saber/armor/amuletpro.c
"helmet of ranzarak"  /players/saber/armor/dragonhelm.c
"orb of earth"   /players/jaraxle/3rd/alt/items/earth.c
"shadow veil"   /players/arrina/armor/sveil.c

Mako reported a bug with his dragon bag which resulted in 12 roht fruit disappearing.
I talked with him and it appeared to be legitimate.  I can't access the dragon bags, and will report it
to Fred when he gets back from vacation to see if he can figure out what's wrong.  In the meantime,
I refunded the 12 roht fruit from /players/jaraxle/closed/heals/roht.c
