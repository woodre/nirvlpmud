This probably sounds really bad....


Hmm... boiling it down, simply, the nice guy, good or bad as that may be :). I have varied interests one of my more recent ones was teaching myself how to weld... well kinda, I'll get better at it :). There's always something to do, so long as there is someone to do it with really. Other than that I'm just me, accepted or not I see no reason to pretend to be anything else :). In short I am looking for someone who is honest, has a good character, intelligent, and accomplished (in some shape or form), and has her life together and doesn't need someone else to put the pieces back into place. Beyond that, it's just a matter of getting to know each other and see where it leads.
