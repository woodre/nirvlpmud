Playbill.c is now a working playbill that randomly generates a show each time that
a player reads it.  This is the temporary version of the playbill.
It will be easier to code the theater and the NPCs, then to have the
theater randomly generate the show at reset by calling a random NPC
at that time.  Once the theater and NPCs are done, I will modify
the playbill to query the theater to see which NPC is there,
then display the appropriate message.

I am putting all of the NPCs in the NPC subdirectory just to keep
everything relatively organized.  There will be at least one
per show (some shows have more than one).
I will also eventually include the front desk employee (if Boltar wants an
actual NPC for there), and any other employees necessary
i.e. wait staff for the restaurant, etc.

November 3, 2002:
I'm still working on NPCs, and have several done (with all their equipment).
Things will be busy at work this week (4 trials in 3 days), so I don't expect
to get a LOT done until the weekend.  However, it's a 3-day weekend coming up, so I should
hopefully be able to finish the NPCs (or come close) by the end of the weekend.

November 16, 2002:
I have nearly all the NPCs and their equipment coded.  
I expect to code the actual theater this week, and think that I have a grasp on
the call outs.  I also need to work on the descriptions for the
restaurant and the bar sometime this week.

December 8, 2002:
All NPCs and their equipment are complete.
The descriptions for the restaurant and bar are complete.
I'm working on the theater, and hope to have it done shortly.

December 9, 2002:
The Theater is done and working.  (Boltar tracked down the call
problem with the playbill.)  
I'm now working on descriptions for the casino area, 
which will be one big area with each game coded as a separate room.
Also, the cashier area needs a description.
The layout is in Boltar's /casino/floor directory.
