  "The third floor hallway is brighter than that of the lower floor,\n"+
  "with large picture windows at either end of the hallway spilling\n"+
  "outside light across the forest green carpet.  Rows of sturdy oak\n"+
  "doors line the hallway on either side, each accented with a brass\n"+
  "plaque identifying its room number. An ornate marble plate on the\n"+ 
  "corner of the wall reads, ‘Rooms 326 - 350'.  Soft track lighting\n"+
  "runs the length of the hallway.  Several small sculptures stand\n"+
  "patiently on short marble pillars spaced evenly along the\n"+
  "hallway.  It is silent, save for the soft hum of the furnace \n"+
  "and air conditioning unit.  The walls are a muted beige up to\n"+
  "waist height and a deep forest green from there to the ceiling\n"+
  "with a thin border of cherry wood separating the blocks of color.\n"+
  "To the south is a similarly decorated hallway, the marble plate \n"+
  "on the corner reading,‘Rooms 351 - 375'.  Another hallway lies to\n"+
  "the east, its room numbers obscured from this distance. \n");
