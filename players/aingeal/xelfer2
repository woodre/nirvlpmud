Xelfer tells you: You need to re-read your own story about how and why you founded Nirvana, Brent.

You tell xelfer slander.

> tell xelfer I recorded the proof of stuff that is uniquely my code.

Xelfer tells you: I believe everything I said about you.  I do not consider telling the truth to be slander.  You should talk to the ones who cued me in in the first place, if it is untrue, th
ey are the ones who slandered you.

Xelfer tells you: I never got any letter demanding whats yours be removed.  We would gladly remove it.  
But honestly with so many of our realms having been created on Nirvana in the first place there is bou

]) Xelfer tells you: I wonder why you think it is so difficult to code a mud.  Our 1.0 lib is coded from complete scratch, no 2.4.5, no VortexLIB, no anything, and we are over halfway complete in one month.  And its far more complex than what we have here
.
