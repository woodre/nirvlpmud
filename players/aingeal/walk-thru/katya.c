3/23/03	Walk-Through -- Katya's Bolivar Town area

ROOMS:
NOTE: You don't have your "listen" or "smell" set for any of the rooms.
You may wish to set these, at least some of them.  (Just a suggestion,
not a required change.)

Likewise, you need to have an add_action for when players try to enter
the various non-room shops that appear in your room descriptions so 
that the player does not get "What?" when he or she tries to enter.

Also, you have a great many rooms that are nearly identical (i.e. many
of the rooms leading to the town are the same except for a sentence
in the middle of the description, the town rooms around the square
are the same except for one or two minor changes).  You need to add some
variety in the room descriptions.

Your directions around the town square (starting with room8.c) do not
make sense.  I mapped them out.  They double back at one point, but do 
not close the loop around the square.  From reading your descriptions
(i.e. the shops you see as you move through the area), it appears as
if you had a loop around the square in mind when you did the area, but
this is not what is happening.  Take a look at this, and make sure it 
reflects the map you had in mind.

auto.c
1.	Third line:  "washer" should be "washers".
2.	You need an item description for: dryers, office supplies
3.	In the item description for "tools", you do not need the comma.
4.	In the item description for "register", "fashion" should be
	"fashioned", and "50's" should probably be "1950's".

frogs.c
1.	Main description: "scatter" should be "scattered".  "On the north
	wall..." should read "The north wall..."
	On the fifth line, put the carriage return before "windows" so that
	it carries to the next line (it's sticking out).
	In the last line, there's a typo:  "th at"
2.	In the item description for "clothing": "hang" should be "hung"
3.	You need an item description for: "clothing racks"
4.	In the item description for "register", "fashion" should be
	"fashioned".
5.	In the item description for "windows", "take up all" should be
	"take up all of...."

pizza.c
1.	Main description:  The second sentence ends in a preposition.
	Third line:  "tehy" should be "they"
2.	You need an item description for: booths, play area, children

road1.c
1.	Main description:
	"Along side" should be one word.
	The last sentence should start with "A small town" rather than 
	"The small town", and "seen in" should be "seen on".
2.	You need an item description for: field
3.	In the item description for "sheep", "distance" should be "distant"

road2.c
1.	Main description:
	"Along side" should be one word.
	The last sentence should start with "A small town" rather than 
	"The small town", and "seen in" should be "seen on".
	This description is almost identical to that in road1.c.  You should
	make some other changes to this description to make it a bit different.
2.	You need an item description for: field
3.	In the item description for "sheep", "distance" should be "distant"

road3.c
1.	Main description:
	"Along side" should be one word.
	The last sentence should start with "A small town" rather than 
	"The small town", and "seen in" should be "seen on".
	Again, this description is very similar to that of road1.c.  You should
	make some other changes to this description to make it a bit different.
2.	You need an item description for: field, pastures, pasture
3.	In the item description for "sheep", "distance" should be "distant"

road4.c
1.	Item description for "businesses": "site" should be "sight".
2.	In the item description for "sheep", "distance" should be "distant"
3.	Item description for "houses": There is a mismatch with the main
	room description.  In the main description, the houses are 
	"scattered", but here they "flood the sides of the road".
	One should be changed for consistency.

road5.c
1.	Main description:
	Avoid using "you" in the main description.
2.	Item description for "road": You need a comma between "tar" and
	"giving".
3.	Item description for "businesses": There are already businesses
	in the main description on either side of the road, and the item
	description is in conflict with that.
4.	You should put an add_action in for "e" and "w", since you 
	identify specific businesses in those directions.  (You can
	just do a write statement telling the player that those
	establishments are closed, or some such thing.)

road6.c
1.	Main description: 
	You do not need the commas in the first sentence.
	I would restructure the second and third sentences in this 
	description -- the current structure is a bit awkward to read.
	Perhaps: "To the west, a Subway is currently under construction.
	The town square is to the north."
2.	You need an add_action for "read plaque".
3.	You need an item description for:town square, square

road7.c
1.	Main description:
	"has" should be "was".
	You do not need a comma after "square".
	"4 story" should be "four-story".
	You need a comma between "large" and "four-story".
	"court house" should be "courthouse"
	There should be a comma after "small" and before "personal".
	(Also, "personal" is sort of a wierd descriptor for "town" -- 
	did you mean "personable"?)
2.	Item description for "road":
	"court house" should be "courthouse"
	This is a run-on sentence.  You should break it into two 
	sentences at the comma.
3.	You need an item description for: town, square
4.	Item description for "town square": "angel" should be "angle"
5.	Item description for "court house":
	"4 story" should be "four-story".
	"court house" should be "courthouse"
	What was it built "off center" of? 
	You don't need a comma after "center"
	There should be a period after "route", with "A statue" starting
	a new sentence.
	There should be a comma after "sword out".
	In the last sentence, "was made" should be "is made".

1.	Main description:
	You don't need the comma after "square".
	"has" should be "was".
	"court house" should be "courthouse".
	"4 story" should be "four-story".
	You need a comma between "large" and "four-story".
	"rent to own" should be "rent-to-own".
	Take out the extra space before the period at the end
	of the description.

3.	Item description for "court house":
	"4 story" should be "four-story".

	You don't need a comma after "shop".
	"washer" should be "washers".
5.	Item description for "road":
	"court house" should be "courthouse"
	This is a run-on sentence.  You should break it into two 
	sentences at the comma.

1.	Main description:
	You don't need the comma after "square".
	"has" should be "was".
	"court house" should be "courthouse".
	"4 story" should be "four-story".
	You need a comma between "large" and "four-story".
	"no where" should be "nowhere".  Why do you have a road 
	leading nowhere?
	"two story" should be "two-story".
	The last sentence is a run-on sentence.  You should break it at the
	comma, starting a new sentence with "On the bottom..."
	"On the bottom floor seems to be..." is not grammatically correct.
	It should either be "The bottom floor seems to be..." or "On the
	bottom floor is...."
	"lawyers office" should be "lawyer's office".
	there should be a comma after "office".	
2.	You need an item description for: town, square, law office,

MOBS:
In general:  You have multiple descriptions starting with height and weight.
There is nothing wrong with this per se, but it doesn't really create a
"picture" of the mob and becomes a little boring if they ALL start the same
way.  You may want to re-think those a bit and vary the descriptions.

Also, you need to think about setting combat chats.  Its a bit disconcerting
to have "Kimberly smiles happily!" in response to massacring her to
small fragments.  

Your mobs have absolutely no items -- only gold coins.  You should consider
making a few items consistent with your theme to add some variety to the
area.  For example, the children could carry a toy or candy that is a heal; 
the adults could carry a shopping bag or a purse or wallet that contains 
the gold coins.  Or, they could have clothing that serves as newbie armor.

dan.c
1.	The first sentence of his description is a run-on sentence.  Also, 
	you should spell out non-compound numbers (i.e. six instead of 6 and
	forty instead of 40.  250 is fine as-is.)

cathy.c
1.	"brings out" should be "bring out".


kimberly.c
1.	Isn't this the exact same description you used for another mob?

alec.c
1.	You need a comma after "nicely cut".

No changes required in the following (other than the general note above):
cynthia.c
ann.c
julie.c
lisa.c
samantha.c
justin.c
kristin.c
seth.c
