2/4/03   Walk-through on Tristian's "goblin" area
(I laughed my butt off at the goblin chats - they're a riot!)


g_room1.c:
Recommended changes or errors:

1.	The first sentence of the description is a 
run-on sentence, and should be split into two sentences.

2.	(Grammar) "...looms largely...." in the last sentence should 
be "...looms large...".

3.	(Sentence structure / verb tense inconsistent with other item 
descriptions) The item "trees" should probably read: "These tall pines have 
probably been growing since this forest was new."

4.	You need an item description for: "fires", "cook fires"

5.	The description for item "forest" does not describe the forest; rather, it describes the light in the forest.  (I like the descriptors, though.)  You   may wish to add a short sentence in the beginning of that item description 
describing the forest itself, then keep the "dazzling display" sentence.  
Also, avoid the use of "you" and "your" --  the sentence is still grammatically correct if you end it with "above."

6.	(Typo) The description for "goblin": "looking" rather than "lookin"

7.	(punctuation) The description for "listen" should have a comma between "camp" and "and off further..."

8.	The "south" exit leads to Tristian's castle, and the 
player cannot get back to the room.

Suggestions:
1.	(Sentence fragment) You may wish to make the item "clearing" a full 
sentence.
2.	(Sentence fragment) You may wish to make the item "tents" a full 
sentence.



g_room2.c:
Recommended changes or errors:

1.	(Punctuation) In the main description, there should be a comma between 
"dominates the area" and "and a crude wooden...."

2.	(Grammar) The item "grass" should probably read: "Taller grass, about
waist high, makes a perfect hiding area for a goblin."

3.	You need an item description for:  camp, clearing

4.	The description for item "forest" does not describe the forest; rather, it describes the light in the forest.  (I like the descriptors, though.)  You   may wish to add a short sentence in the beginning of that item description 
describing the forest itself, then keep the "dazzling display" sentence.  
Also, avoid the use of "you" and "your" --  the sentence is still grammatically correct if you end it with "above."

5.	(Typo) The description for "goblin": "looking" rather than "lookin"

6.	(punctuation) In the description of the "rusty short sword", there 
should be a sentence break after "better days" with "Rust adorns...." starting
a new sentence.

Suggestions:

1.	You may want to add combat chats to the goblins.  (The non-combat chats
were hysterical!  I loved them!)



g_room3.c:
Recommended changes or errors:

1.	Main description:  Eliminate the use of "you" in the description (e.g. 
"leads you to believe", "almost makes you vomit...", and "As you turn away from ..... you catch a glitter....")

2.	Main description, second sentence is a run-on sentence.  The logical
split would be to start a new sentence after "debris".

3.	You need item descriptions for:  pile, trees, heap, 

4.	In the item description for "trash" and "debris", uncapitalize 
"Garbage".    (By the way, the item descriptor for "garbage" is VERY funny!)

5.	There is an extra period at the end of the item description for 
"carcasses" and for "flies".

Suggestions:
1.	You may want to have the wolf pelts cloned upon the death of the
wolf, rather than having the wolf "carry" the pelt while it's alive.


g_room4.c:
Recommended changes or errors:

1.	Main description:  (typo) "infront" should be "in front".  Eliminate the
use of "you".

2.	Main description: (punctuation) There should be a comma between "ground" and "and".

3.	Main description:  (typo) "amonst" should be "amongst" and "sporradic" 
should be "sporadic".  (Also, from a stylistic standpoint, it might flow
better to say "there is a bird circling..." rather than "there is a 
circling bird..." -- but either is equally correct.)

4.	(Typo) The description for "goblin": "looking" rather than "lookin".

5.	Item "grass":  "sparrodic" should be "sporadic".

6.	You need an item description for:  ground, bird, clouds


g_room5.c:
Recommended changes or errors:
1.	Main description:  Eliminate the use of "you" in the description (e.g. 
"looms around you" and "directly ahead of you...")

2.	"smell": (grammar) It should read: "The smells of wood smoke and
dirty goblins waft through the air."

3.	(Typo) The description for "goblin": "looking" rather than "lookin"

4.	You need item descriptions for:  camp, ground, tent, and flap.

5.	The item description for "firepit", the period is after the 
carriage return.



g_room6.c:
Recommended changes or errors:
1.	Main description: run-on sentence.  The logical break would be after
"clearing" with "Small tents" beginning the new sentence.  Also, there should
be a comma between "here" and "leaving little...."

2.	(Grammar) Main description, second sentence should read:  "Cookfires
are spread out amongst the tents."

3.	Main description, last sentence:  There should be a comma between 
"backdrop" and "broken", and "you" needs to be eliminated from the sentence
(i.e. "prevents people from wandering.....")

4.	(Typo) The description for "goblin": "looking" rather than "lookin"

5.	You need to add item descriptions for:  camp, ground, cookfires, sky, 
	line.

6.	(Sentence structure / verb tense inconsistent with other item 
descriptions) The item "trees" should probably read: "These tall pines have 
probably been growing since this forest was new."  Also, there's an additional
period at the end of the description.

7.	Description for item "picket":  "stick" should be "sticks".  Eliminate
the use of "you" in the description.  Either 1) make this two sentences (end
the first after "forest" and begin the second with "More importantly,...") or
take "it" out of the sentence (i.e. "more importantly prevents.....")

8.	The description for item "forest" does not describe the forest; rather, it describes the light in the forest.  (I like the descriptors, though.)  You   may wish to add a short sentence in the beginning of that item description 
describing the forest itself, then keep the "dazzling display" sentence.  
Also, avoid the use of "you" and "your" --  the sentence is still grammatically correct if you end it with "above."

(NOTE:  You might want to give these NPCs non-combat and combat chats.)



g_tent.c
Recommended changes or errors:

1.	Main description:  Try not to use "you" (e.g. "You have entered...",
"you see a table...", "You think you have....")

2.	Main description:  The first sentence is a run-on sentence.  The 
logical sentence break is between "area" and "you see a table...."  Also,
there should be a comma after "but".

3.	In the item description "tent", you use the plural rather than
the singular.  It should probably read:  A better made tent than the 
previous ones, leading one to suspect that they were pillaged from some
unlucky caravan.

4.	You need an item description for:  maps, floor, 

5.	In the item description "rug", there should be a space between
"pillaged" and "from".

6.	(typo) In the goblin's chat, "fidgits" should be "fidgets".  (Also,
in the goblin's description, "fidgity" should be "fidgety".

5.	In the item description for "trash" and "debris", uncapitalize 
"Garbage".    

6.	In the description for the goblin general, the first sentence
is a sentence fragment (lacking a verb).

7.	In the description for the general's short sword, you need
a comma after "monumental".



NOTE:  I'll try to finish the walk-through of the rest of the rooms tomorrow 
evening.  Please mail me if you have any questions, either via mudmail
or at aingeal_the_wiz@hotmail.com.

****************************************************************


2/8/03	Completion of walk-through.




ALL rooms -- be sure to even up the length of the lines in your descriptions.
Some are hanging over.
Also, you may want to consider putting in some combat chats for your mobs.


g_room7.c:
Recommended changes or errors:
1.	Main description:  (typo) Last line: "comming" should be "coming".  
Also, you should use "fifty feet" or 50 feet rather than 50'.  (You used
20 feet elsewhere -- just make it consistent between rooms, whether you 
choose to spell out the number or use numeric digits.)  
(Stylistically, it flows better to say "blow the flap aside" than to say
"blow aside the flap" -- just a suggestion.)

2.	Main description:  "comming" should be "coming".

3.	In the item description for "trash", uncapitalize "Garbage".

4.	The description for item "tent" should either contain 1) two complete
sentences (i.e. "This tent is larger than the rest.  Strange ......") or
delete the verb in the second half of the descriptive phrase (i.e. "A 
larger tent than the rest with strange symbols of lighting bolts and clouds
painted on the sides.")

5.	Eliminate the use of "you" in the "listen" description.  Also, in the
main room description, you describe the sound of chanting, but it's not 
mentioned in the "listen" description.  It should be added for consistency.

6.	The "smell" description should read: "The smells of wood smoke and
dirty goblins waft through the air."

7.	You need an item description for "flap".

8.	You need to even up the length of the lines in the main description.


g_room8.c
Recommended changes or errors:

1.	Main description: The first sentence is a run-on sentence.  Also,
there is an adjective mis-match (apparent....but....obvious -- apparent and 
obvious are not antonyms).  A better way would read:  The clearing is strangely
bare here, the absence of tents notable.  Rows of straw dummies, the hard-
packed ground, and rows of wooden swords make it obvious that training
goes on here.

2.	The description for item "clearing" is two sentence fragments
linked together.  One possible alternative is: "An open area of the woods 
covered with hard, packed dirt."

3.	The mob chat should read: "The goblin drops....." rather than 
"The goblins drops...."

4.	The description for item "dummies" is two sentence fragments
linked together.  One possible alternative is:  "These straw dummies,
riddled with slashes and holes, have seen better days."

5.	You need item descriptions for:  rows, ground, 

6.	In the description for items "swords" and "spears", you mixed a 
sentence fragment with a complete sentence.  An alternative would be:  
"These wooden practice swords (spears) would be of little value and of no 
use to an adventurer."

7.	(Typo) The description for "goblin": "looking" rather than "lookin".
Also, elimintate the "you" in the description.

8.	The "smell" description should read: "The smells of wood smoke and
dirty goblins waft through the air."

9.	You need to even up the line length in the main description a bit.


g_room9.c:
Recommended changes or errors:

1.	Main description:  The first sentence needs to be split into two
sentences.  (The break should be after "bare here.")  The description also 
refers to a corral (singular) in the first sentence, then to corrals (plural)
in the second and third sentences.  
	The sentence beginning "Some tents stand over...." should be split
into two sentences.  (The break should be after "by the corrals" and a new
sentence started with "These tents are....")  The second half is also not
grammatically correct.  Hrm...it's probably easier just to change the second 
sentence as follows:  "Some tents stand over by the corral which are slightly
larger than the tents in the rest of the camp."
	The third sentence either needs 1) a semicolon in the place of the
comma, or 2) "and" inserted before "even the ever...."  Also, "by corrals" 
should be "by the corrals".

2.	You need an item description for "water troughs".

3.	In your main description, you describe the troughs as "water
troughs"; however, in the item "troughs" you describe them as "food or
water troughs".  These need to be consistent.

4.	In the description for the item "carcass", "grizzly" should be "grisly".
Also, "half eaten" should be "half-eaten".

5.	In the description for your elite goblin rider, you have two sentence
fragments, then a full sentence.  If you're going to have more than one phrase
in a description, they should probably all be full sentences.  Also, 
"overside" should be "oversized", and "together" is a plural mismatch with
"this pair" (a singular).  This might work better:  "The elite of the goblin 
army, the dreaded goblin rider, is a slightly oversized goblin astride a 
fearsome wolf.  Together, these two make a deadly team."

5.	You should have the wolf clone the wolf pelt when it dies, rather 
than having it carry the pelt.  (It's not realistic to have it carry its
own pelt.)

6.	(two typos)  The wolf's description should read:  "A snarling wolf 
whose rider lies dead on the ground."

7.	You need to even up the line length of the main description.  ("Over"
		hangs over past the rest.)


g_room10.c:
Recommended changes or errors:
1.	The mob chat should read: "The goblin drops....." rather than 
"The goblins drops...."

2.	Main description:  The first sentence is a run-on sentence, and the
second half is inconsistent with the first (i.e. bare and containing practice
dummies).  A better alternative might be:  "The clearing is bare, save for some
practice dummies that are off to one side."  
	The second sentence is also two sentences stuck together.  You could
1) restructure the sentence as follows: "Straw that probably came from inside
the dummies is strewn about the ground."  or 2) substitute a semicolon for
the comma.
	"scribed" should be "inscribed".

3.	There is a type mismatch in the description for the item "clearing"
(e.g. the hard packed dirt did not come from the foot traffic).  You might
try something like this instead:  "An open area where the ground is packed
hard from frequent foot traffic."

4.	The description for the item "dummies":  "bare" should be "bear".  
You have a sentence fragment attached to a full sentence.  This could be 
fixed by changing it to "The practice dummies are strung up on wooden supports. 
They bear........."

5.	You need item descriptions for: practice dummies, ground, circle

6.	Item description for "circles":  Spell out "feet".  
The sentence does not make sense -- did you mean "used by the goblins for
sword and spear work"?

7.	Your description for item "dirt" should read.  "Dirt.  Plain,....."
(NOTE:  there were other rooms where you had the same description -- I'm not
 sure whether I remembered to noted this change in those recommendations.)

8.	In the item descriptions for "trash" and "debris", uncapitalize 
"Garbage".

9.	(Typo) The description for "goblin": "looking" rather than "lookin".  
Also, eliminate "you" in the description.

10.	Description for "listen": Eliminate "you".  You also need commas 
between "camp" and "and", then again after "forest".

11.	The "smell" description should read: "The smells of wood smoke and
dirty goblins waft through the air."


g_room11.c
Recommended changes or errors:

1.	Eliminate "you" and "your" from the main description and the mob
descriptions.  

2.	The "listen" description is in conflict with the main description.

3.	Main description: The first sentence is a run-on sentence.  The natural
break is between "area" and "the camp".

4.	The "listen" description is inconsistent with the main room description.

5.	The description for item "tent":  The first sentence is a run-on
sentence.  The natural breaks are between "days" and "it probably", then
between "caravan" and "chanting".  Again, stylistically it would flow better
to say "blows the flap open" rather than "blows open the flap".

6.	You need item descriptions for: flap, ground, scrub grasses, grasses.

7.	In the item description for "debris", uncapitalize "garbage".

8.	(typo) In your goblin descriptions, "lookin" should be "looking".
Also, there should be a comma between "dirty" and "mismatched".


g_tent2.c

1.	Main description: There should be a comma between "hot" and "and".
"Hang" should be "hangs".  "the contents" is referring to "a low cot" --
if you mean that the balls of fire are shedding light over the contents of
the room, you need to add "of the room".

2.	The description for item "tent" doesn't match the main room description.
(The item description is in plural, rather than singular.)  Also, eliminate 
"you" from the description.  "previous ones" doesn't make sense from inside 
the tent.  Perhaps "other tents in the goblin camp" might work better.

3.	You may want to add "smell" to this room.

4.	You need item descriptions for: fire

5.	In the item description for "books", eliminate "you".  Also, there 
are typos ("dont" rather than "don't" and "thier" rather than "their"). 
Perhaps this would work better:  "Spell books, written in the gutteral 
language of the goblin.  They have little value to one who does not read 
their language."

6.	In the item description for "scrolls", you have a run-on sentence.  
The break should be between "goblin" and "The figures...."  (Also, you need 
a comma after "page".)

7.	The pentagram is uneven at one point on the right-hand side.  
(Nifty idea, though!)

8.	In the goblin wizard's chat, "breathe" should be "breath".

9.	In the goblin wizard's description:  "mutting" should be "muttering".
"breathe" should be "breath".  The second sentence is a run-on sentence.  
You can either: a) split it into two sentences (...high quality.  He is 
muttering....), or b) put a comma between "quality" and "and" (this 
technically fixes the sentence structure, but is less readable than 
splitting it into two sentences.)

10.	Velvet robes description:  You have a run-on sentence.  You can either 
break the sentence after "robes" (where you have the comma) (preferred), or 
after "clean".



g_room12.c
1.	Main description:  (First sentence) "sparrodic" should be "sporadic".
(Second sentence) You need a comma between "tents" and "and".

2.	You need item descriptions for: grasses, cook fires, stump

3.	You really should spell out your single-digit numbers (i.e. one fire 
rather than 1 fire)(This is in your description for item "fires".)

4.	In both item descriptions for "trash" and "debris", you need to 
uncapitalize "garbage".

5.	The description for item "forest" does not describe how the forest 
looks. Eliminate the use of "your"-- "tower overhead" would work just as well.
Also, there is a typo in the first sentence ("dazzaling" should be "dazzling".)

6.	In the description for item "picket", "stick" should be "sticks".  
Eliminate the use of "you".

7.	In the description for the mobs: "lookin" should be "looking".  
Eliminate the use of "you".


g_room13.c
1.	Main description:  The first sentence is a run-on sentence.  The 
sentence break should be after "...across the area."  The next part of the 
sentence doesn't make sense -- what does the dirt share the landscape with?  
This should be a full, grammatically correct sentence.  "uptight" is not 
the correct usage for that word in the last sentence -- did you mean next 
to the tree line?

2.	In the description for item "grass":  "sparrodic" should be "sporadic".

3.	In the description for item "stream", there is a run-on sentence.  
It should break between "water" and "buckets".  Also, "laying" should be
"lying".

4.	In the description for item "trees", there is an extra period at 
the end of the sentence.  Also, delete the comma and insert "that have" 
between "pines" and "probably".

5.	You need an item description for: tree, fence

6.	In the description for the goblin: "looking" instead of "lookin".


g_room14.c
1.	Main description: The first sentence is a run-on sentence.  The
logical break is between "camp" and "small trees".  Typo -- "brids" should
be "birds" and "farther" should be "further".  "Amongst" should be "among".

2.	Description for item "forest" -- same as above.  It doesn't describe
what the forest looks like, and eliminate "your" from the description.

3.	Description for item "trees":  "ten" instead of "10".

4.	You need item descriptions for:  grasses

5.	The description for item "grass" is inconsistent with the main
room description.

6.	Eliminate "you" from the description for item "picket".

7.	In the description for "smell", it should be "waft" instead of "wafts".


g_room15.c
1.	Eliminate "you" from the main description.

2.	Description for item "grass": eliminate "you".  Also, you should make
this a grammatically correct sentence.  Perhaps: The taller grass, about
waist high, makes a perfect hiding area for a goblin.

3.	Description for item "trees": see above.

4.	You need item descriptions for: zones, kill zones, lines, sight lines

5.	Description for item "forest" -- same as above.  It doesn't describe
what the forest looks like, and eliminate "your" from the description.

6.	Description for "goblin sentry": "lookin" should be "looking".
Eliminate "you" from the description.

7.	Description for "rusty sword": This is a run-on sentence.  Break 
between "days" and "rust".  


tower2.c
1.	Eliminate "you" from the description.

2.	Descriptions for "north", "east" and "west": Eliminate "you".  

3.	Description for "south":  Run-on sentence.  Break between "goblin
camp" and "there is".  Eliminate "you".  There should be a comma after
"corrals".  Sentence break again after "fire pit."  

4.	Description for "goblin sentry": "lookin" should be "looking".
Eliminate "you" from the description.


tower.c

1.	Eliminate "you" from the description.

2.	Descriptions for "north", "east" and "south": Eliminate "you".  

3.	Description for "nouth":  Run-on sentence.  Break between "goblin

1.	Eliminate "you" from the description.

2.	Descriptions for "west", "east" and "south": Eliminate "you".  

3.	Description for "north":  Run-on sentence.  Break between "goblin

"corrals".  Sentence break again after "fire pit."

2.	Descriptions for "west", "east" and "north": Eliminate "you".  

3.	Description for "south":  Run-on sentence.  Break between "goblin
camp" and "there is".  Eliminate "you".  There should be a comma after
"corrals".  Sentence break again after "fire pit."  



g_room16.c
1.	Main description:  This is a run-on sentence.  Break between "still"
and "grass", then again between "ground" and "stacks of logs".  Eliminate
"you" from the description.

2.	Description for item "forest": see above.

3.	Description for item "grass": eliminate "you".

4.	Description for "moss": "growing" rather than "growin".

5.	You need item descriptions for: ground, stacks, 

6.	Descriptions for "north", "east" and "west": Eliminate "you".  

7.	Description for "south":  Run-on sentence.  Break between "goblin

8.	Description for "goblin sentry": "lookin" should be "looking".
Eliminate "you" from the description.


g_tent1.c
1.	Main description: Eliminate "you" from the description.
This is a run-on sentence.  Break after "area".  You might try:
"This is one of the larger tents in the area.  There is a dirt floor with
strange symbols drawn in the dirt."

2.	Item description "tent": "tents" should be singlular rather than
plural.  Eliminate "you".

3.	You need item descriptions for: floor, dirt, coals, instruments

4.	Item description for "brazier": "three" rather than "3".

5.	Description for "shaman": You need a sentence break after "directions".
