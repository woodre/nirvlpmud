Prison Terms
10-24-97 -Bp
 
A character may find himself in prison if he harrasses other
players (outside of game based hunting, pking, etc), harrasses
wizards, is a general nuisance, spamming, etc and so forth.
Prison terms will be determined by the imprisoning wiz and boltar.
Minimum sentances are as follows:
 

1st offense:  1 week  
2nd offense:  1 month
3rd offense:  3 months
4th offense:  1 year
5th offense:  life or banishment
 
These are MINIMUM sentences. The severity may be increased due to the
nature of the offense, past history, or simply the players attitude.
While the 3rd offense is listed at 3 months, it is likely that most
players who will likely have gone through numerous warnings will
end up with the life/banishment sentence.
 
Appeals must have good grounds and be submited to Boltar.
