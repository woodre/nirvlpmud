Have Lolth come out and kill them. :)Who you think left this you fool**Food for Thought(mouzar):**I watched an antclimb a blade of grass this morning.When he reached the top,his weight bent the bladedown to the ground.Then, twisting his thoraxwith insectile precision,he grabbed hold of the next blade.In this manner,he traveled across the lawn,covering as much distance verticallyas he did horizontally,which amused and delighted me.And then, all at once,I had what is sometimescalled an "epiphany,"a moment of heightened awarenessin which everything becomes clear.Yes, hunched over that anton my hands and knees,I suddenly knewwhat I had to do...QUIT DRINKING BEFORE NOON!American @-, Greetings**"
