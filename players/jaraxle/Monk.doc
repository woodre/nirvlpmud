Monks:

[Overview]

Monks will be loosely based on many different styles of Shaolin Kung-Fu.  Each "Style" will have it's own exp to gain for training
through the ranks up to Master (attaining style specific abilities
as the player progresses).  The way of the Monk is not a close knit
guild, but one of self advancement through training and combat.  A
"Master" monk may take on an apprentice (or more than one) to train
in their style of combat.  Certain Styles can only be learned by combining two or more styles into one (This will be noted further down)

 _________
[Drawbacks]
 '-------'

Some of the drawbacks of the guild:
Although Monks can wear armor, the weight of the armor will greatly affect the combat in a negative manor.  
The Monk will not have any spellpoints (no matter the mag stat) all
spell_object damage will come from the styles learned and the level
of the style.
