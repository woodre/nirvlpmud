1] Have all players level 5 and under log in at the entrance to the Apprentice
   Hall instead of the Advance hall.  Making access to the rules, syle, items
   and generally a really good invitation to the mud area easier.

2] Move a copy of the advance hall to the Apprentice Hall (to compliment the
   change in login location).

3] Code a Newbie Book | Includes the most used help files, information on areas
   and their locations.  Items of special note (Nebwie helpers etc).  This book
   should not be a novel, but a summary of important information for a new
   player.  This item should autoload on Newbies w/ a toggle for loading or not.
