                                    [Werewolves]
                                      09.19.03


[:] Overview [:]
This guild is loosely based on the idea of lycanthrope. Or
A human being fabled to have been changed into a wolf; a 
werewolf.  The guild will be tied directly to Nirvana's 
day and night sequence (wonderfully coded by Vertebraker)
During the day, the Werewolves will be seen as "human" -
being able to take arms during combat.  At night they will
automatically change into Werewolves.


[:]Guild Structure[:]
The guild is based on a 10 level system.  Each level is gained
automatically as guild experience is earned.  Guild experience
is only earned through combat.  Player has a certain percentage
always deducted from kills to be placed into guild. Player level
is completely separate and still requires combat.  

Guild level:    Guild xp:
1                  ----
2                 10000
3                 40000 
4                160000
5                300000
6                500000
7                600000
8                750000
9                850000
10              1000000

As the player gain in guild level, they receive points to
spend in abilities.  These points can go toward new skills,
spells, etc.  Some of these abilities will be cumulative,
allowing you to put more than one point into it.  Some
abilities require having another ability first.
