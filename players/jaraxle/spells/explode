Wocket wizs: biglongdescript = read_file("/jaraxle/prettybird.txt");


 ie prettypicture = RED+" \\'{;a.l\n"+" (oa;/ei''  'a'.>)9\n"+".. "\n"; tell_room(myroom,prettypicture);
array_picture = explode("biglongdescript","\n");
for(i=0,a=sizeof(array_picture);i<a;i++){
tell_room(myroom,array_picture[i]); }
Wocket wizs: well it should be explode(biglongdescript,"\n"); sorry
Jaraxle wizs: ok
Wocket wizs: and when you tell room it should be array_picture[i]+"\n";
