tmp_text "No Elite is to Aid with coins, or a party any member of the Shardak or Cyberninja guilds.  If you are seen doing so you will be removed from your Elite Status.  I knowthis will not be an issue with any of you, it just needed tobe stated.Jarana - [Templar] Elite General**Brothers and Sisters of the Elite,We as Elite Templars, True Defenders of the Realm, are toalways be at the ready.  Therefore - if you are on, youneed to have a weapon in your possession AND wielded.  Tobe without is to risk removal from your Elite status.  Thisof course, does not include the 10 minutes directly beforereboot - so you may store your weapons and go unarmed whenArmageddon is about.Live for a reason.     Die for a cause.Casper [Templar] Elite Lieutenant**Cyberninjas and Shardaks are not to be trusted, any elite guard found aiding themor assisting them in any way, IE: Coins, Gear, Heals or even if they ask you to add someone to our crimminal list, the Guard will be removed from ranks of the Elite.-Jarana [Templar] Elite General**It has come to my attention that Evil coinage is needed, SoI have started a list, feel free to add areas.  Ninjas - In Dragnars wasteland Green,5e,3n,w,kill ninjas,s,kill ninjas, like 10 ninjasQurds - 4w,3n,enter crystal,n,w,s,s,e,n,w, wander around a little,7 qurds one mageFerrets - 6w,3s,4w,all s,all w,all n,a few e,enter hole,forest,is westand south in a cave(Someone maybe able to post better instructions than me.Xetra - 5e,5n,get crystal, wander around, the Xetra all the way down is not ezRyo's - green, all e,pass,ancient,e,n,forest, 4 ryo room going e, dont go 5, mayend up in the forbidden forest.Mystic Caves - are on the nw most part of the continant(Can not be pked is great for coin rebuilding, when you need to)I have been away for awile, so if you have other 'Hot' coin spots leavea note and we will have a better list.- Jarana**another good spot for coining is the sewer monsters in derellia4w,6n,u,2w,2n,enter gate,2e,n,w,backdoor,move grate,enter hole,d good coins in there also another good place is the other mystic caves in jaraxles area5e,2n,enter tree,n 3w,cross,cross_west,w,s,place hand in carving.also dark pyramid is a good place for coins just little harder hitting than most areas also in jaraxles area.5e,2n,enter tree,all s,enter pyramidalso amity is a good place to coin 6w,3s,4w,3s,w,enter hall,2n,ealso the bar in pestilence's area is a nice place to kill good coins in there as well6w,3s,4w,3s,w,enter hall,2wjust my two cents worth hope it helps.hailjason**1 - Don't quit out (If your out smarted you will learn from the fight)2 - Don't dissconect (Again you will learn more from death than cowardice)3 - You must have PK set, unless you just died, and are rebuilding coins.4 - You must PK crimminals aggressivly (This is tuff when they are invis I understand.)5 - Have fun doing it.6 - If all else fails go back to rule 5.- May your sword strike deep in the heart of Evil --Jarana**I'd like to see a list of the Elite Guard posted in the main hallsomewhere, and I'd like to see the Elites who have not proved themself worthy, culled from our ranks.  Another possibility, is toraise those of the knights who have proven themselves to followthe laws and tenets of our guild the best, and demonstrate an interest in pk, and an aggressive attitude, to elite status, andperhaps taught to PK.perhaps taught to PK.Sometimes Zmud is annoying :)In any case, I need to be more active myself, but I think it wouldbe good if each of us who can get on, would actively party and helpother knights.  A job of the regular knights is to help newbies,and anyone who asks for it or needs it.  I would think that part ofours is also to help other knights raise their skills and knowledgeto a higher level, as this would benefit the guild in general.-Juggernaut, Smiter of Evil and Poster of Longwinded Messages :)**I guess in light of a recent occurance i will be leaving any bags of non-tox and whatever coins i have extra here for elites since an ally came and took 120k coins or rather they miraculously disappeared from equipment room along with a couple of the non-tox from bag and other stuff to sell in bagwhich isnt that big of deal just rather annoying that 120k disappeared so ill leave coins and non-tox stuff here for elites if i have any after i leaverage**Greetings brothers and sisters, Just wanted to introduce myself, my name is Marek.
