Synopsis:
      The player must travel through a linear path
of caverns with dangerous dragons in order to find
and slay the blue dragon king.  Along the path the
player will be forced to fight numerous aggresive
dragons which will block their mode of escape in
order to reach the dragon king.  There are wrong
turns which bring the player to numerous dead 
ends along the path that force the player to yet
again fight more dragons.  Each dragon has only
dragonscale on them as items.  The dragonscales
come at 1 to 2 pieces per slain dragon.
	At the end of the quest if the King is 
slain the player can search for the treasure room
of the dragon king which holds unique items and
a treasure of coins equal to the amount of dragons
necessary to find and slay the king.
