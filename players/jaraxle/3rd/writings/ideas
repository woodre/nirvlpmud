[1;34m>> [2;37;0mJul 30 23:10 [1mSexkitten   [2;37;0m Might be useful to do some sort of take-fail when trying to get the quiver or arrows rather than just seeing they aren't here. Even if I am going about this the wrong way, it's frustrating. <<[1;32mplayers/jaraxle/3rd/warrior/rooms/room3[2;37;0m>>

[1;34m>> [2;37;0mJul 30 23:22 [1mSexkitten   [2;37;0m I think that there should be some sort of fail message associate with cut. I am trying cut in a ton of different ways, but none work and I just get a 'what?' rather than recognizing that I am on the right track. Given 'cut' is highlighted in the wall desc, it shouldn't be a miserable experience trying the word with no idea what's going on. I have tried a lot of permutations of it, many time. Heh. <<[1;32mplayers/jaraxle/3rd/warrior/rooms/treee3[2;37;0m>>
[1;34m>> [2;37;0mJul 30 23:28 [1mSexkitten   [2;37;0m Ammended for your record since you prolly aren't fixing these as we speak. I think cut should have a fail message so that people get any sort of idea that they are on the right track. Since I am so fucking cute, here is an example: You try and try to cut, but alas, your fingers just aren't sharp enough. <<[1;32mplayers/jaraxle/3rd/warrior/rooms/treee3[2;37;0m>>
