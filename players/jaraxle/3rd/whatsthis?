This area is called Third Earth. It is the homeland of the Thunder Cats.
Third Earth is actually a planet. Which leaves for a lot of different
possibilities. For now we will have Robear Berbils, small robot
bears. Tree-Top Kingdom, a tribe of warrior women who live.. well
in the tree tops. Hook Mountain, which is covered with snow
and ice. Unicorn Keepers, who live in the forest w/ the Robear
Berbils protecting Unicorns. Cats Lair, the home of the Thunder Cats
The Black Pyramid, where the EVIL Mumm-Ra resides. Castle Plundar
where the Evil Mutants live.
