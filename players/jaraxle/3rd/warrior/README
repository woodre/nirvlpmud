*    This is the area of Warrior Maidens. Warrior Maidens    *
*  are an all female clan that live among the trees. There   *
*  are only few things of note for this area. There is a     *
*  "lost boy" ("/players/jaraxle/3rd/warrior/mon/boy.c")     *
*  who runs around all the rooms. He has a "machete"         *
*  ("/players/jaraxle/3rd/warrior/weaps/machete.c") which    *
*  clones broken and worn.  You need this to get into the    *
*  secret hut ("/players/jaraxle/3rd/warrior/rooms/s_tree.c")*
*  In the hut area is the Warrior Maiden Queen, Willa        *
*  (/players/jaraxle/3rd/warrior/mon/willa.c"). She has the  *
*  "prize"item ("/players/jaraxle/3rd/warrior/weaps/w_bow.c")*
*  The weapon she has is not very good alone, you need items *
*  called "quivers" bought from Liza.                        *
*                                                            *
