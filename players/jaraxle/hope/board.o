You have always been a role model to me. I have been an ally to the knights for quite somee now. I have seen knights come, and go.

nce decisions myself because
I get no input from it's members.  The Alliance is always a work in progress, and I am proud
of how the Alliance is working out thus far. I would die for any Alliance membe
      So remember, if you have the chance contact an Ambassador, with comments about
prospective members, what you think the Alliance should stand for, what is an active
member of the Alliance etc.  I am eager to find out what this great diverse Alliance thinks.

In Your Service,

     Hail Sword Brothers,  I just wanted to remind you of two security issues within the Tower
Of Hope.  First off, please do NOT bring anyone who is not a knight, or ally into the Tower.
The reason is fairly simple, we don't want an enemy sticking around waiting to jump one of us.
Secondly, Whiteblade can be hired to attack players in any room coded by Maledicta, this includes the
Tower of Hope.  So just don't try to idle here unless you are very careful!

In Your Service,

--DD

Allies!
What another beautiful day at the Tower of Hope, basking in the
sheer glory of this great Alliance! I would just like to offer
my assistance to any Alliance member that may need it. If you
need equipped back up, let me know. Need a corpse returned? Just
ask. Getting pked? Well hollar and Ill be setting pk as I run to
you! And anyone is welcome to fight along side of me. I just ask 
one thing, please come prepared. You will be hit occasionally, 
bring armor and heals. "Great risk yields greater gains."

Movin on Up!

In the days of when I was a child, I remember how the 
now fabled warriors were. Their platemail was not always 
gleaming and strength not always unyielding. They bled red and 
cried the same tears as you or I.  Most of all, I recall how 
they stood for a chosen cause. On the foggy coastal plains of 
Nirvana, many brave warriors fought for the causes of good and 
held evils at bay. My mind rests on the war between the invading 
goblin armies and the Knights Templar with their Allies. 
	The sun rarely shone through those stormy clouds and the 
land seemed wrapped in a blanket of darkness. The very wind 
itself seemed to howl in anguish as it blew over those goblin and 
ogre ridden shores. These armies were building and churning, 
waiting for the right moment to break through and storm Nirvana, 
pillaging and killing as they went. The time was ripe for the land 
to plunge into an era of darkness and turmoil.
	It was decided that the Knights and Allies would stand up 
and bind together, forming a wall through which no evil could pass. 
So warriors took up their weapons and others offered their own 
special skills in any way they could. Healers would heal, and 
non-combatants would provide a steady flow of resources and 
encouragement. Those lands became a proving ground for the Knights 
and their Allies. Rifts that were once tearing began to close and 




















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































still the fierce 
sounds of battle rang throughout the land. Yet even in the days 
that followed morale continued to rise and more and more people 
stood up to assist these brave warriors in their cause. People 
remembered the days of old when the guild of Templar Knights 
stood proud and unified. They began to speak the names that were 
being written in history like Stone, Jarana, Whitedawn, Ghost, 
Daredevil, Beowulf, Cooper, Little, and so many others.


**
Slowly as the week progressed the huge army of 8,200 
ogres and goblins were beaten back and only two strongholds 
remained. The Knights and Allies had finally reached the goblin 
base camp and the cave of the red dragon clan. The dragon king, 
Falesgauntriax, King of the Reds, had allied himself with the 
goblins and was prepared to fight. A short council was held and 
it was decided that the dragons were a greater threat and a band 
of warriors set out to invade the cave. Once inside, they were met 
by onslaughts of darklings and numerous minor dragons. Finally, 
they reached the massive dragon. The air in the royal cavern reeked 
of sulfur and the beasts soft underbody was encrusted with jewels. 
Unwillingly to turn back and give up after coming so far, they 
bravely faced him. Flames singed and burned; smoke made it hard 
to breathe and yet after the air cleared, the mighty dragon 
king lay defeated. 
	A promise of victory was on the mind of every individual 
who participated in those long battles. Only one windy tent stood 
between them and then they could restore the peace of Nirvana. 
Again the forces regrouped to plan the siege on the base camp. 
Together, the Knights with their Allies stormed the lonely 
stronghold and defeated the enemies outside of the tent. Inside, 
however, lay Garshlog, King of the Goblins decked out in pounds of 
jewels and an uncountable number of robes. Garshlog was huge, tall, 
very, very obese, ugly, and smelled of a mix of rotten eggs, rancid 
pork, and two month old pizza. Stone led the attack and fought 
bravely with his brothers and sisters. Even the King of the Goblins 
could not stand up to the Knights with their Allies and with a loud, 
reverberating thud, he crashed to the ground, dead. 
	Tired and worn, the Knights and Allies stood united in 
victory. What remained of the goblin army dissipated into darker 
realms or was killed. Only a small clan of defeated Red Dragons 
remained hidden deep within their caves. 
	Rumors had been spreading like wildfire that the late King 
had somehow found the mighty sword Excalibur and kept it with him 
at all times. Whispers said that it was hidden in his personal tent. 
Stone spotted a hidden treasure room and found the mighty sword 
Excalibur hidden in a treasure chest. The magnificent sword once 
wielded by King Arthur was presented to Stone in honor of his 
leadership, skill, and many other attributes on the battlefield.
	Silence washed over the land as the sounds of the fierce 
battle fell quiet. The invading armies had been defeated and their 
strongholds were destroyed. The coastal plains lay soaked in blood 
and chaos. Something needed to be built in order for no enemy to get 
so close to overrunning the land of Nirvana again. Not merely a 
watchtower, but a new Templar stronghold that could stand up to such 
opposing forces. 
	It was decided that with the wealth earned off of the defeated 
soldiers would build a castle to prevent invaders from getting so 
close again and keep watch on the cave of the dragons. This castle 
would become the new home for the Knights Templar and would be welcome 
to their Allies at all times. Not long after this, Fortress Stone 
stood proud overlooking the vast oceans to the west. Its thick walls 
could withstand any siege and the test of time.
	Slowly, people came to the fortress and built up a small town. 
This grew into a booming port-city eventually, which they named New 
Ares. Shops, inns, and taverns sprung up and with this more people 
arrived. They told tales of a time that was now passed of gleaming 
platemail and unyielding strength. Even now, people still rejoice when 
they hear about the warriors that fought for them, and will forever.


Many thanks to the brave warriors who fought for this land and the 
wizards that help guide them. This historic event was captured to
paper by Breezy the Bard.

    There are a couple of things that have been going on that I feel need
to be addressed;
     I know not everyone roleplays, or keeps within the rules of player
seperation, but some people do.  I really do not like the idea of players
taking a group of someone characters and not allowing them to play each
character individually.  Things like speaking to them about matters that
do not pertain to that character, but another character they play.  
Treating them in a manor suited for a different character they play.
Even giving information out of character, can sometimes be very annoying.
All I'm asking is that you guys be a little careful about things of this
nature as it might not bother you, to talk to someone about another character
of yours; but it might bother someone else when you talk to them about another 
character of theirs.

It has come to my attention in recent days that a number of Allies were unhappy with the current status of the Alliance.  I deeply regret any pain or inconvenience Knights or other Allies may have caused.  If there is anything, _anything_, I can do to make your time in the Alliance more enjoyable, don't hesitate to ask.  Many Allies have contributed a great deal over the past few months (and beyond).  I know recognition in a formal sense may be slow in coming, but I want you all to know it has not gone unnoticed.  A belated "thank you" for all your aid and I will strive to be more regular in my thanks in the future.  I would also encourage Knights and Allies to take advantage of the resources of the Tower of Hope (in addition to those found in Fortress Stone).  The Golden Plaques are in need of updates, a great many Allies have contributed in blood and gold in recent times.

SALUTE
