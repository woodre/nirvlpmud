This is a brief description of the items cloned off the npc.

brain.c :  a trasure item, when 'consumed' will add 1+random(3)
              to a players mag stat for 200hb. (about 10mins)

heart.c : a trasure item, when 'consumed' will add 1+random(3)
              to a players sta stat for 200hb. (about 10mins)

lfoot.c : a trasure item, when 'consumed' will add 1+random(2)
              to a players ste stat for 200hb. (about 10mins)

rfoot.c : a trasure item, when 'consumed' will add 1+random(2)
              to a players ste stat for 200hb. (about 10mins)

lhand.c : a trasure item, when 'consumed' will add 1
              to a players str stat for 100hb. (about 5mins)

Each stat stays on the player through reboot, crash, quit, ect
for the duration of the time period.
You can only consume the item 1 time per type, until the
duration wears off. (1 brain, 1 heart / not 1 heart, 1 heart)
[this will reduce players from holding onto multiple items to use
at once]

tenticle.c: a trasure item that can be traded in Forbin's area
                  value1 = (1000+random(300));
                  value2 = (850+random(650));
(dependant on the trader they use)
