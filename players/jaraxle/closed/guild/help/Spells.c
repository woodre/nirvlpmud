    A Geomancer casts Elemental spells, in a manner
similar to Sorcerors -- the Geomancer does not
have any need to prepare spells beforehand; their
selection of known spells is markedly curtailed,
however.
     At each level, the Geomancer can learn one 
or more new, known spells. The Geomancer may 
elect to choose a spell from the Geomancer spell
list, or hold that slot open, to fill with the results 
of their own research, as they choose.
    To learn a new spell, either automatically or by
research, requires the use of a Gem, valued at
1000 coins times the level of the Geomancer. The 
gem is specially prepared to hold the patterns 
of the spell.
