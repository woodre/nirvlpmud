   Geomancers get along reasonably well with many
spell casting guilds, with whom they share not only
the ability to use magic and research new spells, 
but also the experience of a longand very difficult 
apprenticeship.  They can find  themselves rather 
frustrated with the "flightiness" of less-disciplined
guilds, such as Bards, Polymorphs, and the like, 
while they find that the steadiness of nerve, the 
permanence of attitude, of more disciplined classes
(Paladin, Monk, etc) to be much more pleasing.
