"bugs" within the guild itself or objects dealing                      
 with the Geomancer guild you should notify Jaraxle                     
 or any Senior (Wizards of level 100 or greater)                 
 immediately of any situation you come across.                  
   This would greatly help the function of our guild                    
 as well as keep any mishaps at bay.
