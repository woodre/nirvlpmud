Warriors:
Known as the Sword of Ba'kar, the Warrior Skeletons are the
main fighting force behind the god's plans.  They wield 
weapons with skill and defend well against most attacks. 
They are the soldiers and bodyguards of the entire clan,
with security falling directly on their bleached bones.

Priests:
The Priest sect of Ba'kar is known as the god's Shield. It
is these skeletons that prepare the warriors for combat,
strengthening them with powerful blessings and sending the
warriors and magi soul energy to use in their battles.  
The priests are the most respected of all the ranks for their
ability to bring success when there is little hope.

Mages:
If the Priests are the Shield and the Warriors are the 
Sword, then the Mages are nothing less than the vengeance
of Ba'Kar.  The mages wield powerful soul energy magic
that can lay waste to the enemies of the Horde.  Yet,
even with all of this powerful magic, they require the
protection and blessings of the other two ranks in order
to succeed.  Mages are called upon when the heaviest
firepower is necessary.
