 
Obviously, if you are reading this, you are looking through my files.
I don't mind other wizzes looking through my files because I do it too.
 
Please dont steal code. If I have something of interest to you, please
mail me, tell me, wiz me, shout me, etc. I will gladly let you get a
copy of something , and even help you configure or modify it to your
needs in whichever ways that I can.
 
Not that any of my stuff is really advanced, but I'm serious, I am 
happy to share code and whatever knowledge of it that I can.
 
				Thank you,
				   Miz
