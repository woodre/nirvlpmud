07/04/06 Earwax: knocked out the multiple-spawning of callouts in 
the noise fun in these files, added a def to ~pain/color.h to help
facilitate this, made these stop recursing if there is no player in
room, this shit is ridiculous.  Someone (prolly me) can eventually
go back through this shit and add code to init() to call the messages
but until that happens we can do without the resource use.
