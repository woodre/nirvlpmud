------- LEVITATE --------------------------------------------------------
The art of Levitation requires intense concentration and control.  The spell
allows the caster to lift his/her body off the ground and into the air,
above would-be predators and the such that prowl below.
  It costs 50 spell points to initiate the spell.  Can it be cast in battle?
That depends on your discipline...You can try and levitate while fighting,
but success is Not a given, there is quite a large chance that you will
fail, and the cost for the spell will be taken anyways.
  What can be down while levitating?  You can still see everything that
 happens in the room, and you can still 'say' and 'look'+'look at' items
 in the room, but attacking, kicking someone, etc, are all not possible
 (you cant kick someone when you are floating 30 feet above them, however,
  neither can they kick you...)
Movement while levitating: Moving while levitating is Very difficult and
  has limitations, A Monk can only move Once for every Rank Over 10 he/she
  has.  Thus a Rank 10 cannot move at all, while a rank 17 can move 7 times.
  each movement costs 5 spell points.
 command: Levitate (cost:50)  command: Fly <dir> (cost: 5 per movement)
