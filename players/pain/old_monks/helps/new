Welcome to the Monks Guild ver2.1

*Obvious Changes
1. Armor class for all monk levels is better. I will not tell numbers
you figure it out, but it is better.

2. Styles are back. They are automatically added in with respect to you
guild level, str and sta amoung other factors.
--you will notice the extra attacks while you fight

3. NO PKING
--i realize this may not be popular, but it fits with theme
--if your pk is not set now, you are fine, if it is, mail me
and i will remove it. 
--this topic i am sure will be discussed at length later

*Not so Obvious Changes
1. Spells
--off hand i couldnt say what is gone and what is not gone, what i suggest is
that you traverse through the helps to find what has been removed
and what has been added.
--the only spell added i can think of is Tornado, which is level 8,
much like chain lighting only better
--my opinion on spells is this: if it doesnt work or doesnt fit theme
it can removed at any time with no notice. If a spell messes up or
you just cant get it to work, check out the helps. If it is not there
then it has been removed. I will try to put on the guild board when
i pull a spell or if i add one.
