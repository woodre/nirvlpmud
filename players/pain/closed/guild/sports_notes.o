All it does is convert 50 sps to hps over a shortperoid of time.  Instead, make it a refresh spell, and let the monkcall squirrels or something to donate part of their life force.the sps will be used to call, the hps gained, and the time peroidpreserved waiting for the animals.The second  idea is for the the hp mon and the monk stats opetions to display how many how many shields we are using.**weenis envy(smaug):**'ve lost all our heroes in pop culture.  They're murderers and wife beaters (OJ and Tyson know who they are) or greedy (aka 80% of pro baseball...)  And people wonder why we are disenchanted with sports...Colleges fix grades for atheletes, and they even show their appreciation by leaving for otherinstitutions which give them a bigger car....Go minor league baseball.
