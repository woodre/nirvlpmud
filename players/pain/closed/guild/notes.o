messages "robes [Hawkeye : Fri Mar 29 00:09:24 1996]:**Sorry all, the robe thing is kinda wierd. None of my stuff is autoloading properly, not my castle or the robesor even my personal stuff. I mentioned it to Boltar, but not sure if he can do any thing about it or not. Ill look into it a little more next week if it doesnt get better. For now, just register, sorryhawk**serious question [Hawkeye : Sun Apr  7 20:29:11 1996]:**Okay, here is the deal. My sorry butt is leaving this wonderful university in34 days. I do not plan to be here any longer. This means several things:1. If no one takes this beast over, it will stagnate and die.2. I will not be here any longer :) or maybe :( who knows3. You will all get pissed.Anyway, enough of that crappy list. Here is my question. I need someone totake over the guild, like full time ish. No I cant wiz anyone and no I cantteach anyone to code. Since I have asked this question before with little orno response, I am assuming that no one wants it. To me this means I only haveone fair option and that is for me to close this guild over the next monthand give back all xps you have all put into it, and be able to join anotherguild. Basically this comes down to, I take all your guild xps, and add themright back into your regular xps, for you high level types, that will be a significant increase in xps, would get you quite far in most guilds. Thisis really up to all of you, it doesnt matter to me whatsover. If you can convincea wiz to take this over, fine, if not, Ill probably close it. Do me a favorand do a little voting here on the board, lemme know your thoughts and ideasI am putting the guild in your hands and I want you to let me know whatyou want with your guild.Thanks for your time.Gary(Hawk)**Re: hawkeye [Sasha : Sun Apr  7 22:48:56 1996]:**My opinion is that I want to see the monks continue to grow and be strong.We may be in a bit of a slump right now but I have recruited a few new people in the last week so there is still interest.Hawkeye, I completely understand your position and don't blame or hate you for the choice you have made.I do appreciate the chance to find a new wiz and hopefully something willcome of it.  I have placed a note on the advguild board kind of as a classified ad for someone to take over when Hawkeye leaves.  If anyone hears anythingabout a wiz interested let other know so we can try to convince him/herto help us.I guess I just don't want to see the Monks go down like when I watched theDopples fall apart.Sasha**like, dudh [Gemini : Mon Apr  8 16:25:52 1996]:**i'll do it.i will try my best. etc etchawk, you know my e-mail so we can correspond**Go Gem! [Tristan : Mon Apr  8 17:13:08 1996]:**Hmm..I've been around this guild for almost three years now.  I know form experience that it has the strongest foundation of any guild ever to be formed on Nirvana.  I have also seen Gemini code, and scary as this is, he should be an excelent leader of the monks.  This guild is strong, and can still flourish..-Tristan  (Not Tristian)**Gemini [Martha : Wed Apr 10 23:17:15 1996]:**As much as I hate to say this, I think Gemini should do this.I don't want to see the guild go down.  I know I worked my buttocksoff to get where I am today.  I don't want to lose that.I also don't want to see all of Hawkeye's work go to waste.Gemini is good, REALLY good.  I know he can do it.  That is, ifhe wants to :)martha**Support Gemini [Topace : Sat Apr 13 06:52:46 1996]:**Though I am just an insignificant member of this guild, I'd just like to expressmy support for the guild and Gemini.  It's hard to imagine a mud without monks and healers in.  Hawk has surely done a great job and I'm sure we'llall miss him.TopAce.**"
