messages "Guild Master(sasha):**I for one (hopefully more) think that this guild is too good to let fall apart.One of the strong points of this guild is the family unity.  I have posteda sort of classified ad in the advguild looking for a guild wiz to takeHawkeye's place.  I plan on asking every wiz I see if they can help us but if that doesn't work then I guess I will have to deal with the end of the Monks.Suggestion:  Maybe the GC's should plan a time for a meeting to talk aboutthis and see what we can do?Sasha**yeah(gemini):**tell me when the meeting will be**meeting(sasha):**Is there a day that is the best for anyone or a time of day?  I would like to see as many gc's and guild wizzes there as possible.Sasha**meeting(gemini):**usually after 5pm weekends is good for me. but before 11 pm**times(alison):**I try to be here on Sunday nights like 6-10, Mondays I can be here 6-10, Wednesdaysfrom 6-9, and other evenings I can make arrangements to be here. I think someone should take it upon themselves to organize everyone's times and pick a decently good time for all. Of course that depends on everyone leaving a slot open on hereasap. Let me know what you guys thinkAlison**Times(sasha):**Sunday nights around 7pm cst are good for me.  I like the idea of "office hours" and someone keeping track of themso that we make sure all the newbies and recruits are taken care of not to mention the wonderful monks that are already here.Sasha**meeting(martha):**Hrrrmmmm...Most likely, I will be unable to attend.  For 2 reasons.1-there is only one computer in my house.  I won't be able to get on it for the meeting most likely.and 2 I will have to work most likely.But if not, I can be on from like 5pm until 11 or so.Or basically any time.  If I can't be here, I will be informed of everything.ThanksMartha**"
