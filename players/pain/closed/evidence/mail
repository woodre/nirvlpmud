Subj: I'm such an asshole sometimes....

Date: Oct 16 09:22

I don't need to hear that I'm an asshole all the time, btw...

You know what I forgot to ask you the other day?
Would you like to join Wil and I at the hockey game tommorow?
I have a couple of extra tickets and it would be a shame if
they were not used...
Great seats, behind the players bench, about 10 rows up

Let me know...  either here or tommorow.

ps- Do you have Brian Harel's number ????
     I have not been able to get ahold of him
thanks
