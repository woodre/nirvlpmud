Greetings and Salutations my Dearest Nirvana.
     We are going to have a Nirvana Party at the middle of next month.
Most likely the weekend of the 19th-21st. If you
have any conflicts  please let me know.
Ummm to confirm your arrival please send me Nirvana mail
letting me know that you would like to come, let me know
who you could bring that is in your area, and then send a deposit of
$20 to: Nikki Lee Miller
         4204-201 Greencastle Ct.
        Raleigh, NC 27604
Please send only money orders, no checks or cash...
Also I need to know if you would be willing to cook something
while you are here. We need food for this bash and anything you can
do to help on that note would be great.
We are trying to get a few hotel suites for the Nirvana
party and that is what the $20 deposit is for, if you can pay
more that would be muchly appreciated.
Thanks again and let me know. If you have any questions you can email
me or you can call me at 919-981-0913 at Home after 6:00pm EST.
                          Love Ya Loads,
                              N.
