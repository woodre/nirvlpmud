     Nirvana is a wonderful mud and you have given me a great place to come and escape and enjoy.  I think you've done a wonderful job here and I know that you don't get to hear appreciation too often.  Just whining.
     The last week has been really bad and I wanted to come to you with it a few times but felt that it wasn't my place.  The harsh and false accusations have been hard to swallow especially when they are repeatedly thrust at us.
    I hope you know that I think you are great and I hope that you will come to the new mud.  You are welcome in whatever capacity that you so desire as far as Rich and I are concerned.  We both respect you a great deal.
  *hugs*
