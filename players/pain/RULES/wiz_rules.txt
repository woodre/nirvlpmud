	As a pretext for this file please note:
	if there is no command to do what you wish in
	either 'help wiz_levels' or the wiz_tool in /obj
	then do not attempt to do that action. Most importantly,
	use your common sense, and keep decency in mind when
	dealing with players and wizards alike.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Wizards are supposed to be an example to players.
	Please remember this and act accordingly. The higher a level
	that you attain, the more of an example that you should be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

**	Whenever you do something that affects a player
	you must log this action. This is so that a player
	may not later claim that you did or did not do 
	something. This is for the wizard's protection     **

		-= when in doubt log your actions =-
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Any wizard below level 40 must use the 
	wiz_tool in the /obj directory

	NO wiz_tools should autoload

	If a player is misbehaving, annoying others severely,
	cursing on public channels (except risque) or breaking
	other rules, DO NOT dest the player, but rather move
	the player to /room/prison. This goes for all wizards 
	If the problem persists, other actions will be taken. 

		-= Be sure to log this =-

	The guidelines for behavior as set forth in 
	'help wiz_behavior' should be strictly adhered to.
	These guidelines were set up to remind wizards that
	our main goal on Nirvana is to create new things and
	help the players <when necessary>. Being a annoyance either to
	other wizards or to players defeats the purpose of
	having wizards. We need to foster creativity and
	a sense of being helpful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Keep wizard interaction with players low if at
	all possible. Don't give out any information
	that a player couldn't normally find out. If in
	doubt about whether or not you should give out
	information, instruct the player to ask a higher
	level wizard, or another player.

	Also, do not share wizard information with players.
	For instance, if you feel that such-and-such a wizard
	is not a good wizard etc, or you know that another
	wizard is up for demotion or promotion, or that there
	is an argument amongst wizards, do not share this 
	information with players.. wizard matters should be
	for wizards only.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	If another wizard of a higher level asks that you
	stop doing something, or that you do something, respect
	the level that he/she have attained and do as they say.
	If you have a problem with what they ask, mail your 
	sponsor and the senior wizards and this will
	be attended to. The chain of command or whatever you'd 
	like to call it is there for a reason. Please adhere
	to it and help to end chaos here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Public bickering amongst wizards must stop. Not only
	is it demoralizing to players and other wizards, but
	it does nothing more than exacerbate the existing
	problem into a much larger one. Most problems can be
	settled in a reasonable manner. If you have a problem
	with another wizard that you feel you cannot handle 
	in such a manner, ask a senior wizard, or more than
	one, or Boltar to intervene in the hopes of clearing
	things up. Generally, with common sense and understanding
	almost anything can be cleared up. The important thing 
	is to remember that we should be working together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Each wizard is responsible for his/her own code. If
	something illegal is found, it will not be blamed on
	whomever approved it, but rather the coder. It would
	therefore be best if you made sure that your code
	followed the rules as laid out in /doc/build. If you
	ever have a question about a piece of code, ask
	someone level 80 or over, as they generally should
	know the answer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Creativity is a very important asset. If you would like
	to try something that you think would be interesting
	and or beneficial to Nirvana, but you worry about whether
	or not it is legal, be sure to have it checked out by
	a senior wizard. Usually a compromise can be worked out
	so that Nirvana can reap the benefits of your work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	It is recommended that once you wiz you work on an
	area. Although it may sound boring, rooms, objects, and
	monsters are the most important parts of Nirvana, and
	in coding them, you learn what you need to know to 
	code other things, like guilds etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Test characters should be clearly marked as such:
	i.e. Pain's test character named Painjr the utter newbie
	Test characters should never be high enough to
	be on the top players' list etc. Create them within reason.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	For the most part, you will be given the benefit of 
	the doubt. If your area/guild/whatever is approved,
	it is assumed that it is legal. However, if it is
	discovered that your area/guild/whatever is not within
	the confines of the rules there will be serious 
	repercussions. Any reports of illegal items/rooms/weapons
	will be investigated. It is important that you police
	yourself and your code.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Any wizard, including senior wizards, that code items
	beyond the standerd rules or limits, must have that item/
	room/monster etc. checked by another sr. wizard and/or
	Boltar himself. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	If there is no rule regarding a specific act or
	behavior, or if you have any question concerning
	a behavior or action, use common sense. Always
	try to think of your fellow wizards and players
	when trying to decide what to do. Try to do what's
	best for everyone involved. And always remember to
	log your actions.
