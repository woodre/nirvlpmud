     Key                        
   
---  All files should have a header no matter how small. Add a header to valen_key.c

---  All files should have as the first line of code: #include "/sys/lib.h"
     while it works fine with out it, this is a file needed when and if we
     switch from LP to LD.  So add it to valen_key.c
     
---  Unless you have some really wild key that is extra heavy then I see no
     reason for the key to have a weight of 2.  Change it to 1.
     
---  I am a little confused with the keys desc. it states:
     The emblem is a crossed Sword and Feather
     Is it a feather that is crossed with a single sword or  is there 
     2 swords crossed along with the feather???  either way it should be 
     changed.  I do like the color.
     
     Some ideas.....
     
     The emblem is two crossed Swords and a Feather
     
     The emblem is a Sword crossed with a Feather

     
     
     Belt
          
---  set_ac(2);   should be set_ac(1);
     we always want to make the best, but this is dropped by an average mob so
     no reason to make it higher.

---  set_alias("a belt"); 
     alias are for an alternate name for players to look at objects
     alias are not required.
     I guess it is not improper the type "l at a belt"
     but really who will think to type that? maybe if the short was just a belt...
     If you want to use alias I would either use leather belt or
     Demon Cursed belt, but not a belt
     
---  add a special for the belt. It will be cool to do, especially with its desc.
     have something with the aura...
     special can help a player or just add cool phrases during combat.
     A lot of time if it look cool in and out of combat players use it...
     looks like this:
     
  do_special(owner){
    if(!worn) return;
    if (!owner || !owner->query_attack())
      return;
  if(random(10) < 3)
  {
    tell_object(owner,
      " ADD COOL PHRASE HERE this is for the owner to see \n");
    tell_room(environment(owner),
      owner->query_name()+" ADD COOL ACTION HERE this is for the room to see \n", ({ owner }));
    owner->add_hit_point(random(5));
    return 1;
  }
  return;
}
