Stargate

  Stargate command is inside Cheyenne Mountain beneath the N.O.R.A.D. facility.
This is Earth's base of operation for off-world travel.  I laid out Stargate 
similar to the T.V. series SG-1 with a few changes.  One change is the use of
rings to get from Nirvana to the gate room.  This is due to it taking too long
to travel down 28 stories in an elevator.  I have keep the area to the bottom
three levels of Stargate command which are levels 26-28 which use an elevator
to move from floor to floor.  This will be my new castle area. 
  Gas City will still be keep.  Since the Stargate goes to many different planets
and encounter many different types of people and races Gas City will be one of the
planets they travel to.  I have already started coding two other areas that will be
completed shortly along with finishing the town of Gas City.  The other two are
Lowthar's Land and Nox Homeworld.  Travel is done through the Stargate which also
has an explode file for a picture of the Stargate each time they go through it.
  This area has three main weapons: Goa'uld Staff weapon, Zat gun, and a P90 machine
gun. The Goa'uld Staff weapon is coded as a staff with a special hit for the laser
beam they shoot out.  The Zat gun was created as a modified Goa'ule Zat laser gun 
with a special hit and can be used to disintegrate corpses.  The Zat gun in the show
can actually kill any living thing in two hit and disintegrate them on the third hit
which I know we can't have that here so; it is modified with a special hit and the 
ability to disintegrate a corpse.  The P90 machine gun is a little bit more playful.
It not only can be loaded with bullets but, has many different attachable parts that
players either buy from the private in the main armory and others that come at random
while fighting npc's in my area.  There is a field manual for the P90 they can use to
find all the different accessories.

I created a map that I can e-mail anyone who nwould like it.
