My Tears in Heaven Quest:
 
First of all a player must seek the Guru Brahmin to find out
what he/she/it must do.  The Guru is located inside a cabin
near Thoreau across the lake.  Once inside the cabin, player
must ASK Guru and Guru gives player only one bowl.  The player
must then figure out how they can cause heaven to cry.  So
anyhow, player kills onion john for magical onion.  Goes to
a tower where Daedulus is located with his magical wings.  Player
must kill daedulus for wings.  Player types fly and flies to
top of the mountain.  There, the player must 'peel onion'
'raise onion' to heaven and collects the tears into the bowl.
From there, player types jump and jumps to the blind boy's room.
Player types rub eyes with tears and boy is cured and quest finished.
