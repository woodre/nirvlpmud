  "create. They don't do that all by themselves, that would be too much\n"+
  "effort. There are two large teams which create 102 puzzles together\n"+
  "each day! The team of Francesco is slightly different to the one of\n"+
  "Hippo. Francesco's team has one member more than Hippo's, and the\n"+
  "team of Francesco creates slightly more difficult puzzles. For that\n"+
  "reason each member creates 3 puzzles less than a person in Hippo's\n"+
  "team. Notice that each person within one team creates the same number\n"+
  "of puzzles.\n"+
