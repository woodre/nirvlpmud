Hey, guys!

Nice to meet you. Shake my hand (because that's what I always do when
I meet people). But... what happens to you? This is a miracle... You
did not just shake hands, say 'HI' and walk away, but you have been
lifted by Hippo's hand! And now it seems that you have been swallowed, since
you seem to be arrived in a big mouth! 

After this experience, you can decide two things: going back or explore.
If you choose the best of these alternatives, you'll walk around
in a great place, be able to kill a lot of nice creatures while in the
mean time you learn something about Hippo's (and your own) corpse.

This place can be entered by all kinds of levels, although I'd not enter
when I was below level 5. Even lvl 20's can enjoy themselves in here.

Note: The inner side of a body is not as straight as other places use
      to be. You'll have to do more than north and east, and you have
      to read room descriptions to discover all possibilities.

Note II: If you have trouble with the names of the places or names
         of the monsters, clone a guide line in the liver. It contains 
         an explenation of some things. Besides, there is an abbreviation
         list inside.

Thanks for your attention, and enjoy yourself in 

      ==> THE BODY OF HIPPO !!!!!
