<THINGS>
22chrf: 22 chromosomes of the female <in cell22.c, cloned in uterus.c>
xchr:   X chromosome of the female <in cellx.c, cloned in uterus.c>
eggn:   egg nucleus <sometimes present in r/l-ovarium.c>

<IDEA>
1. goto sex_brains and have an erection to enter the female
2. find the egg nucleus. It sometimes appears in the left, sometimes
   in the right ovarium. It's only there for a short time, so be on
   the right time at the right place).
3. find the 22 chromos and the X chromo to complete the egg.
   Those are located in 2 different cells that run very quickly 
   through the left and right tuba and the uterus. Just keep on 
   chasing and attacking to kill them. Low level, but it takes 
   some time to kill as they have stong armour and high hp.
4. Drop the intact egg in the ovarium. 
   NB: At this time, save player_name with the egg, as only this
   player could fertilize this specific egg to finish the quest!
5. force an ovulation
   Catch some hormones in the blood and release them in the
   ovarium where you implanted the egg. As the ovulation will start,
   the egg 'jumps' into space, where they are cought by the fimbriae.
6. Now quickly leave the female, because there is only little
   time left to finish the quest. The egg is and slowly transported 
   through the tube to the uterus, from where it will leave to the
   vagina during a menstruation (how much time? -> test personally).
   NB: if leaving the female with a sperm-head, dest sperm-head.
7. find a sperm head in the epididimis. 
   This should always be available, but hidden. Some 'search'
   command clones a sperm-head if it's not available yet. Now
   catch one of the sperm cells that twirl around. Use the 
   sperm head for that.
8. Find some nutricien for the sperm to feed it. Doesn't matter
   when it is feeded, as long as this is done at least ones and
   before fertilization. Otherwise, the sperm dies at the time
   of fertilization.
9. goto sex_brains and have another erection
10. choose whether to go left or right (to where the egg is) 
   You can only go 'deeper' into the tuba/ovarium with a sperm_head.
   if you go back, you loose the sperm and you'll have to catch a 
   new one in the testis.
   If you encounter the egg, type 'use sperm head to enter egg' 
   and finally 'fertilize egg with sperm'.
