General Notes:
----------------
* inherit should always be the first line in the file
* #include <ansi.h> instead of player specific ansi.h definitions
* /doc/build/monster/monster.guide 
  * Follow as a guideline for level/hp/sp/gold value
* We need mid level areas, and your mobs need to be updated to match the monster guide,
  so please update them to be mid level, level 15 - 24, xp of 2k - 70k
* Cleanup files that are 0 sized or broken or not being used (armor)

Rooms
----------
* Make sure all nouns are items in the room, example car and vomit in e3.c
* When an item has a noun in it, you also need an item for that as well.
  * Example in 1.c trash is an item which shows cans, cans needs to be an item.
* You have multihip cloned 26 times, limit to 8 - 12 (with increased level)
