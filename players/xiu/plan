First finish hippy concert area.

Make camping area with decent lvl 10 mobs with good consistent money
Stage area (eventual higher level "Icons of Rock" area)
For now will have killable jukebox artist who plays songs? Might carry decent wep.


The next area will have a lot of checks on unused attributes if possible...will need to figure out code for that.
EQ with guild bonuses? BF and Mage?

Player housing in Hippy Tent City
An area that asks you random math problems to leave rooms....

Develop a strategy to bring back the player base. Clan wars, pk tourneys, e-mailing, myspace networking etc.
