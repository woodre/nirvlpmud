Definitions and explanations:

/* TESTING CHARACTER */
Tester:     The tester in all cases was a 19+21 test character maxed in
            each respective guild. All stats were at 20.

/* CATEGORIES */
Attack:     This category describes average damage done over 50 hits to
            a test monster of ac0, without spells or attack commands.
Defense:    This shows the 'real' ac of the player against a wc30 monster,
            calculated by applying the average damage of wc30 -
            hit_player(15)- in 50 'hits' on the player and registering the
            actual damage caused by this function. This damage was
            subtracted from 15 to get the differential, multiplied by two,
            and finally added one to obtain 'real' ac (that is randomized
            in hit_player). This method returns ac9 for non-guilded player
            with ac9.
Max Damage: This category shows the average damage done over 50 hits to a
            test monster of ac0 allowing all guild spells and abilities
            but no heals.

/* GUILDS */
Non-Guilded: Used sword of spirits- the maximum storable weapon
             (wc18 1/3 chance return 7)- for Attack, normal armor
             (ac 9, player max) for Defense, and sonic for Max Damage.
Cyberninjas: This guild has 3 attack modes-  defense, none, offense.
             These modes were tested individually in both Attack and
             Defense and are shown in the above order. For Max Damage,
             the highest numbers were obtained using fluxes and the 
             p2 (fireball-equiv) attack spell and this is shown.
Dark Mage:   This guild's strength lies in its heal_self and monster-
             altering attack spells. However, it has a highly-effective
             and highly-variable weapon that was tested in Attack. The
             weapon has special damage against dragons, demons, spirits,
             etc. so the Attack numbers are in 2 categories - against
             normal and against special damage monsters. In the Defense
             category, this guild can wear normal armor so is shown with
             the normal max of 9. Max damage was attained using wound.
             In Attack and Max Damage, heal_self damage is indicated in
             parentheses.
Knights:     Templar Attack numbers obtained using a sword of spirits-
             the maximum storable weapon (wc18 1/3 chance return 7).
             Defense was calculated using a templar shield and ac9.
             Max damage found using ice (though sonic might have been
             more effective).
Polymorphs:  This guild has 2 effective and used forms for attack-
             golem and tetrapod. These forms were tested individually
             and are shown in the above order for attack. In Defense,
             polymorphs can wear normal armor and are shown with the
             normal max of 9. For Max Damage, tetrapods used blitz.
Rangers:     This guild has three modes of attack: normal, morphed, and
             with weapon on. These modes are indicated in the above order.
             There are also three modes of defense: normal, morphed, and
             with armor on. These are also indicated in the above order.
             This guild uses a communally-stored sp system to power its
             'weapon' and 'armor' modes. Since this takes no player sp or
             commands while fighting, the damage and defense are found in
             the normal Attack and Defense categories. However, there is
             no difference between Attack with weapon on and Max Damage as
             they cannot cast additional attack spells.
Vampires:    As of this point in time, vampires have no exceptional weapons,
             spells, or defenses and thus have the same results in Attack,
             Defense, and Max Damage as non-guilded.
