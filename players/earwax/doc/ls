ls (string arg)
ls clear <pathname>

Wizard command: this allows you to list the contents of a directory.
It defaults to your present working directory, or you can use 
ls '..' to ls the contents of the directory one level below your 
pwd (ie, if you're in /players/pimpadocious/tools and you do 'ls ..'
it will ls /players/pimpadocious.  This can be nested. 
Also: ls ~boltar would ls all the files in /players/boltar.

The filesize approximation (k) is the number to the left of the 
filenames, with a '*' indicating that a particular file is loaded.
Directories are indicated by the absence of a filesize as well as by
a '/' at the end of their name.

Color preferences can be set using the 'ansipref' command.  The
colors that can be customized are directories, .c files, .h files,
and there's a setting for all other files to show up in.

Because of how ls formats its displays, once you have ls'd in a 
directory (or anyone has), it retains the format for future use 
(this clears each reboot).  In order to reset it and have it reformat
the display for a particular directory, use 'clear' as an arguement
before or after the path you intend to ls (or just use 'ls clear' if
you're doing ls in your current directory.

Examples:
ls ~earwax/area - show the contents of /players/earwax/area
ls *.c - show all files in your pwd that end in .c
ls ../room - show directory of subdir named room one level below pwd
ls clear - clear and redo the formatting for ls in your pwd
ls clear /players/boltar - clear and redo formatting for ~boltar
