I just spoke with Jareel, the other day i was killed on a 4 on 1 with cybers. (go figure) and it gave me 2 deaths on my tracker. 0 09/23/03 22:08: (4/1) Symbio/Doodle/War/Miso      1 09/23/03 22:08: (4/1) Symbio/Miso/Doodle/War
it is in the .o player file so it would need to be ftp'd in. Don't like dying to a gang rape much less getting 2 deaths for it. Wasen't that bad :oP
Thanks

Nope, i did not quit out...i never left the game. I just went to the church and prayed like normal. I think Jareel was around for it and can vouch i never left the game. This is why it doesnt make much sense....for some reason it changed the order around of the 4 cyber rapers and gave me 2 deaths

Hey - this is your final warning.
Take it seriously.

No more power games with items that are not yours.
No more stalking.
No more chronic dishonesty- tell the fucking truth,
 especially to your fellow wizards.
No TROUBLE of any kind.
You're not the fucking Judge and Jury. If you have an
 issue with someone else breaking rules or laws, tell
 me, tell Boltar, or tell a Senior Wizard. End of story.
 DO NOT EVER TAKE ACTION AGAINST ANOTHER WIZARD IN ANY
 CAPACITY WHATSOEVER.
People who come here deserve PRIVACY unless they are
 a possible security risk. DO NOT ENGAGE IN ANY SORT
 OF RECONAISSANCE ACTIVITY TO THAT EFFECT. YOU ARE NOT
 AN ADMINISTRATOR IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD.
Do NOT dest items from or put items into anyone else's
 inventory. ESPECIALLY wizards.
Do NOT clone items to YOUR player characters.
Do NOT use items to harrass other players, wizards, or
 even NPCs. NOTHING.
NEVER EVER REPORT OTHER PPL's OTHERS OR GIVE OUT ANY
WIZARD INFORMATION EVER.
Never THREATEN OTHER WIZARDS.

I moved MANY objects around in your directory which you
have either no right to or no business having.
Concentrate on coding something of substantial value,
i.e. an area. Don't rip ppl off.

I put a bug on your character. You will be logged
until such time as you have proved yourself to be
a worthy wizard of Nirvana.

Last chance- start doing the right thing.

well, this is how i see it. the main obstacle i think to
pk coming back, is the lack of a player base, but lets forget
about that for a moment. assume we did have the player base.

what would make me pk ?
hmm, not gear, i cant use shit for gear.
hmm, not coins, i leech them.
hmm, xp, no i can kill a mob worth 300k xp.

the only way i see it coming back is this:
roll back the xp ammount to what they were years ago..7k cap.
i kill you, i get 1/4 of your total xp.
yeah its extreme, and would prolly encourage people not to pk.
but it would get me to pk.

not too mention, specific guild weaknesses gotta be adressed.
yeah lifeblood was fixed..but, it still sux to get hit by it as fallen.
this is just me bitching now. lol.

FIX THE FUCKING LAPTOP!!!!!!!
Nothing is more frustrating than to see all these candy asses get uber high levels just so they can't be seen by the laptop.  This enables them to have a huge advantage if they choose to pk...being able to hunt invis players lower than them, and if they choose not to, gives them free run of any pk areas with little to no risk of being seen there.
Go back to having to letting it see all levels, and have it run on batteries that cost $$ and run out over time.
This will at least put most everyone on a more level playing field.  Cash is so easy to come by anymore, it's not like buying batteries will be a pain in the ass.
This could also prevent people from waiting until they're +75 to finally set pk.
Other than that, we just need more incentive...some it's just the adrenaline rush/ego stroke that works, but to actually pull people that normally wouldn't pk in, there's gotta be less risk, more reward.
Maybe less of a death penalty...1/8 xp instead of 1/3?  Also maybe a no loot thing.  This way there's no fear of losing that Gordie stick that you had to suck off a +100 for or whatever.  Most of the pkers give shit back anyway, unless the victim is a whiny little bitch or just a plain asshole, but if there's a definate no loot thing, maybe people will be more likely to try.
Ok..this would lead to a "Why the fuck should I pk if I don't get anything for it?"
Good question.  How about a reward system based on pk points.  Both the MK-Scar and PK-trakker assign points for various pks.  Now say I had 250 pk points.  I could go to the uber-bsness-pk shop and lay down those points to buy some kickass pk only weapon and/or armor.  With less to lose being pked, and some nice rewards for the successful pkers, maybe more people will sign on.
Just some thoughts, and sorry if it's all jumble-fucked to read.

Cut out the pk cheats.  ie disconnecting.  You set pk or go into a pk area and
you lose connection expect to die for it if you get caught.  Nothing was gayer
than finally running down a wizard alt and them pussying out by disconnecting.

In the idea of the pk areas....have rooms with random directions.  Think
maledicta's mystic caves.  But the directions randomize so its harder to run. 
IE: Room has 4 directions N,S,E,W.  Here's my idea leave the same directions but
color them.  South is always blue, red is north, etc.  So the exit is 2 south
from your current position.  East is blue, N green, S red, W yellow.  So type E
because its blue = a south direction.

Get the idea?

Make it so command stacking your way through an area doesnt work.  Its all fun
and games to be able to run to pesty's shake shop in one second.  Yet as a pker
keeping track of pker's coming for you lame that in under 2 seconds someone can
be in the same room as you.

Pauses.  Takes 2 hb for doors to open.  Takes a hb for the key code to be put
in, then accepted. Gotta wait 5 seconds for the random herd of cows to stop
blocking the road.

Eliminate pk gangbangs.  You can only be attacked by 2 at a time unless those 2
ppl dont = your player levels. ie One 19+100 player vs 5 lvl 19's
5 vs 1 still a gang bang but you get an idea of what i'm talking about.

PK body guards.  XP them up like a wocket pet.  Useable in pk like a Neo's pet.
For those of you without the neo pets. (heh)  Pet couldn't be hit unless it was
during a round it attacked.  Area effect spells not sure on.  Pet couldn't be
attacked.  BTW Neo's pet wasn't pk.

Use pk points for "buffs". 10 points for added hp regen for an hour.  15 for sp
regen.  Added Stats for a period of time.
Add another proc to weapons.  I decide to burn 20k coins and add a Direct
damage fire proc to my trusty trident of war.  Sadly the proc only lasts for an
hour but hey its added damage.

Add stuff for non-equipment using guilds something to pk for.  Its all good to
have the newest and best armors/weps but without a current wizard continuely
making changes to adjust for the new items that kinda guild just cant compete. 

But thats one of their disadvantages!  Bullshit.  I'll gladly keep dropping xp
into a guild to add armors (ala rangers)

Less dependence on all the same weapons/armors.  Who doesn't use an elemental
armor, a gordie stick, skates, bracers of speed, etc.  

I'd like to see armors geared/enchanted vs those specific items.  I got a
chainmail +3 vs gordie stick +2 vs tsunami +1 vs player spells.

Make the enchantments not last.  Maybe since the item is magic vs a gordie
stick it will negate all damage from a gordie stick for the round the armor
"procs".

 One of the biggest problems with pk is location abilities. they are to fool proof. There is no real way to hide;. So lowbies dont pk. People should learn to pk as a lowbie. Not as a lvl 19+. So get rid of the laptop and all other location abilities. If the guild has a location abilities then they better suffer in some way.

Xp bonus of around 20% for pkers. Maybe even have a permanent setting that gives some benefits. Coins is a huge problem for pk. Portable detoxer also. Gang bangs are part of pk. Thats life. Ive gotten a lot of kills when I was outnumbered. The tough guilds should be directed more toward solo pk while the weak guilds toward teaming up./

Cc: (To: vertebraker) vital,earwax
Date: Oct  2 09:00

I was walking around looking for a sheep to make bowlegged and i 
had some thoughts regarding noob helpers and noobs in general 
none of these are particularly fleshed, but just thought i'd toss 
them out there for your perusal... 
 
Salvation army box, (poly tug, anything of that nature) - when 
something is stuck in there, set its value to 0, saveability to 
non (except that it can be stored back into the tug, whatever) 
-This way shit doesn't get yanked as sellage 
 
set noob helpers to track xp given to noobs in parties....ie, if 
upus parties up a noob and supplies them with a mil exp, it says 
ooh, upus got this noob a mil exp, let's log it!  (because we don't 
have enough logs)....info might be good later on down the road for 
something i wanna do, i need more thoughts on it, and thinking is 
difficult. 
 
noob helper clanhall kinda dohickey, was thinking mebbe make it an 
addendum to the hall of apprentices or something, or a standalone 
type deal....a little board in there, a non-resetting room, etc 
 
a way for noobs to do feedback on noob helpers and everything in 
general, yeah i know they can mail, etc, but if they had a command, 
or something pop up when they went to gain a level from 8 to 9,  
say hey, what'd you think of noob helpers, did you receive help, or 
what could they do different, anything to add, mail verte, earwax, 
vital, anyone with a pulse, etc 
 
a 'true noob' flag.....ie, if they logon as a true noob, put that 
flag in there for noob helpers to see, i KNOW that's a bad thing in 
the eyes of rp, but come on now, what's rp here....and i don't 
think players would mind so much, cuz hey, noob helpers are really 
lowbie helpers too, *I* know that this guy i'm dragging is prolly  
an alt, but fuckit....it'd just be nice to see at a glance, so that 
if you see someone who's a true noob, or listed as one you can make 
that extra effort to say hey, anything i can help you with, or any 
questions feel free to ask me or use the 'newbie line' .... 
when you see 5 level 1s, you don't really do that individually... 
but if one of them were to have that flag you would i'd hope 
 
in noob helper hall, could have info on suggested gear, (is what 
board would be good for) perhaps a 'condensed suggested gear list)  
or something to be given to noobs....ie, trident of war (on rock 
in rift/ryllian/saber's area) is a really good weapon for noobs,  
BECAUSE .... it heals you up real good when you fight)....or the  
following are unbreakable weapons (which are my favorites to give 
to noobs, they got enough to learn about without fucking with having 
to sharpen and coin for sharpens)

lowering of standards for regen items 
too much emphasis on heals, let's open it up for regens....there is 
no valid reason in my eyes to keep regens so damn limited....maybe 
there was 10 years ago, but the mud was a lot different 10 years ago 
 
consolidated noob areas....i'd like to see perhaps 'noob portals'  
in the entrances/exits to noob areas....instead of doing the 50 dirs 
to get to/from mash privates or ryllian bandits or trix babies, or 
mael's castle stuff, noobs could just kinda zip through....HOWEVER 
i would only like to see that for the lowest level stuff, part of  
game is starting to learn your way around, it's just extremely  
frustrating at first....i can remember personally trying to find my 
way back from the bandits....it SEEMS simple, but it's not as easy  
just reversing the dirs, you make a wrong turn and you end up in  
strange places....think I died as a semi-true-noob (years ago of  
course) when i started playing again....i imagine anyone who's a 
completely true noob has as well, just finding their way to/from the 
noob areas 
OR have a noob-area-emporium....hell, just house it all under one  
room - it'd require taking some of those areas out of regular wiz  
areas, but why not....i'm sure many would be willing, plus those 
wizzes (there are a ton of them) who ONLY coded a noob/lowbie area 
and then nothing after, well....why not just stick them in one spot 
and free up that backbone space for something a little more involved 
and open to other chars 
 
cheat-sheet ... now, there's all sorts of ways to get dirs to noob 
areas or to things of interest, but nothing consolidated or simple 
to use/take with....how about a 'cheat sheet' or help file for it 
simply listing what, and dirs.....ie 'bandits: 5e,3n,w,step rift, 
2w,enter...blah' and then DIRS TO RETURN from it 
once again, i remember filtering through the list of dirs for noob 
areas and getting frustrated.... 
 
noob 'word of recall' yeah....dikus suck for most part, but that is 
a nice thing on them 
the noob school for godwars muds is also something that's nice or 
worth logging onto one just to take a look....maybe it's rom muds in 
general (diku derivatives essentially) but i'm pretty sure the  
godwars variety all have noob schools 
 
faq - noob variety, intermediate player variety and bigger player  
variety 
 
it'd be nice if all that was on the website....how about offering 
one of the non-coding type wizzes the opportunity to start putting 
this (and other similar type info) on the website as well....i've  
seen muds with good websites and it really helps attract people to 
the muds...medievia's is incredibly thorough if i remember right

base gear....why NOT give them base gear....come on, that's shit 
in hall of apprentices, with the inflation here, why NOT give them

as well 
 
noob hostels.....storage is probably one of the most frustrating 
things as a noob....you sit there and say hey, i got this stuff, it 
seems really cool but how do i keep it 
it's frustrating as hell, if you don't know the game, believe me 
 
regarding storage: why not open up more lockers or storage....make 
it 1k for first 3 items, 5k for next 3 lockers, 10k for each after 
that, or something... no limit 
even the casa de nirvy gets real expensive real fast for low levels 
especially ones who can only logon for a few hours a weekend or  
whatnot.... 
 
when they die at < lvl 6 stuff stays on them?  
 
< lvl 9 logon and get issued stuffs every logon?  unbreakable noob 
wpn perhaps?  
 
coins for errands and other things.... 
on other muds there's noncombat things that noobs can do for cash 
ie, there's a quest on one particular mud that requires 'stump  
standers' .... to get into area you need two other people with you, 
so the practice used to be to hire standers....people who would 
go to that area to allow you to get in...easy way to make some quick 
cash....things of that nature would be nice, ... haven't thought it 
out any further than that 
 
-------------- 
anyways, i'm sorry this dragged on so far, had a lot more coming 
to mind as i went through, feel free to forward this beast, or a 
condensed version, to any/all the noob helpers for their feedback 
as well, or other wizzes for that matter.... 
 
it's just random shit, some of it's worth some thought at least i

myself and others to present topical information to interested wizards and 
record the series to use as later training as well. Somewhat akin to the 
old Descarte@TMI files, we could cover various topics that we consider 
'essential' and later ones that are more esoteric but useful for those 
developers that don't have the benefit of our ability to crash the mud in a 
quick and efficient fashion. 
 
To that end, please think for a few seconds about what kinds of topics you

Heavy:     2+       2         4-6    Shield:  2-4 
 
Light would be basically clothing, only real effects would be magical in 
  origin.  Some could supply AC, where thematic; case-by-case basis. 
 
Medium would be for thief/finess fighter types.  This would be the type of 
  armor most beneficial for the future dodge/parry skills. 
 
Heavy would of course be actual armor.  Platemail, chainmail, etc would fall 
  into this category.  AC should definitely reflect weight.

Magical Gear/Accessories 
Necklace/Amulet (Neck class, since otherwise it'd be collar/gorget) 
Rings (2)       (Disallow rings if gauntlets/gloves used?) 
Earring?        (Disallow if helms are used?) 
Belt            (Come on, these aren't physical protection) 
Misc/I guess Teddy could go here, compete with other miscs 
 
I'd also like to see multiple slots be added in, could be fairly easily  
implemented, I'll prolly slap a code snippet for it together.  Basically 
it'd be similar to multiple properties in rooms.  This would be very easy 
to do, really.  Switching stuff to these standards based on their current 
weight/ac values would be very easy as well.  If they are ac 2, their weight 
will be 2.  New stuff will use the new functions, if it uses the old funs  
then it automatically gets adjusted on load.  I really don't wanna explain 
further, but it'd still require a lot of adjusting by hand. 
 
Anyways, let me know what you guys think.  This is far from an end product, 
but it's somewhere to start, and I think it's pretty much what we should 
go with in the end.  Between us we should be able to hash out a pretty good 
system.

If you get jailed, you shouldn't be allowed to login another char. 
Therefore we should make it so you can't quit from there, combine 
that with rules against multi-playing, jail becomes much more of a 
deterrent, since the only way you could logon another char would be 
to disconnect and wait for that char to poof.

Vahiti was once again caught exploiting a known bug.  This time it was 
the same bug as Earwax had nailed him earlier exploiting.  The dervish 
can offwield (as you know) and it is offset by not being able to use a 
shield.  Yet he was wearing a full death set of armor (armor, gloves,  
amulet, misc, helmet, boots, and shield) while wielding and offwielding 
two Iron Death Blades.  Since I'm not a PA and none were here or unidle, 
I issued him a warning.  But am also sending this report to you.  He is 
also a well established bug abuser and rule breaker.  Before the days

is not like he has not been given fair warning.  It really bothers me 
that there are never any PAs around when he is doing this, and it is  
not very fair to players who follow the rules and are not abusing any 
sort of bugs or exploits in code.  And since I am not a PA, I cannot do 
any sort of action against him as we were clearly told to let the PAs 
handle these sort of issues.

Yeah, I'd really like to redo exp so it's awarded based on who does/takes 
the most damage from a monster.  I haven't really looked into how feasible 
it is yet. 
It shouldn't be too hard to come up with something, though.

This person has been caught in th epast abusing things, now he has been 
passing gear from one character to another, So I put him in prison for 
at least a week, though more should be done as he was also the same 
person exploiting the exp/coin thing with the closed shadows guild, and 
he's been here for awhile he knows the rules yet consistantly flaunts 
himself and his ways of breaking or seeing what he can get away with. 
Granted he is of the group that will probally go crying to worm when  
they get nailed, I don't care.

Once again he's abusing the guards in the Templar gate area.  What has 
to be done before something gets done about him? 
 
He's always pulling this crap and feigns ignorance or outright stupidity 
if anythign he damned well knows what he's doing.  At the least that 
character shoudl be nuked to uselessness.  Otherwise he will keep doing 
what he's been doing.  I realise knights are buggy, and it goes beyond 
the scope of my knowledge, but seriously, he's been spoken to by Fred/you 
and other wizards more times then Donald Trump has dollars.  He will do  
some shit then will lay low until the heat is off and then repeats this 
crap.

If it were up to me, I'd hand out a minimum of 6 months jail time 
for vahiti... Khrell is right, he abuses bugs regularly, 
plays dumb when he does, and yet goes back and does it again 
I've spoken to him several times since becoming a PA wizard 
in fact, I've spoken to him more than any other player on here 
for abuse of bugs, players, or eq sharing with his alts. 
So, as far as I'm concerned this is at least his 3rd offense, if 
not 4th... If you have any problems with this sentence, please 
let me know, if now, I'm going to go ahead and jail him by 
tomorrow... 
thanks
