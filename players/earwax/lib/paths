Created 11/15/05 by Earwax:

The following are the conventions for filenames and paths supported
here:

~:  Your home directory
~filename:  Filename in your home directory
~wizname/filename:  /players/wizname/filename
~wizname/dir/filename:  /players/wizname/dir/filename
../../doc:  .. moves dir up one level, so if this was done from home
            directory, it would result in /doc
blah/blah2/filename:  Would be your pwd/blah/blah2/filename

To have a path/filename converted to the absolute path (meaning
the full path and filename from root) use the sfun resolve_path().
