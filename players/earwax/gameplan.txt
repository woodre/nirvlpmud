Following are the projects for making Nirvana a better place:

Convert to LDMud
  1) Get lib running (Boltar doing this)
  2) Optimize and go through simul_efuns (Earwax)
  3) Fix command system (Earwax)
  4) Go through lib for the following:
     - Change all write(), other string concatenations to (s)printf()
     - Ensure all mappings/arrays pass copies rather than themselves
     - Make sure everything works properly
  5) Add areas to the game one at a time, debugging each
  6) Enhance the documentation and work with wizards on changes
  7) Optimize as much code as possible, get mud as stable as possible
  8) Create OLC tools, to foster more building.

  1) Attribute changes
  2) Race changes
  3) Gear changes
  4) Skill system for core/guildless
  5) Combat changes - move to to-hit system, other changes
