Armor Proposal

I'd like to propose the following changes to worn gear:
-Worn gear to be classified as 'armor' and 'accessory'
-armor has ac value...ac meaning 'armor class'
-accessories have no intrinsic armor class.  Instead, they can provide special
 abilities, protection values outside of ac, damage specials, etc
-armor to be classified by its weight/ac ratio with the following categories:
 Body Armor:
   Categorization           AC  Weight
   clothing/nonprotective -  0    1
   light                  -  1    2
   medium                 - 2-3  2-6
   heavy                  - 4-6  4-8

 Shields:
   nonprotective          -  NA   NA
   light                  -   1   1
   medium                 -  2-3  2-3
   heavy                  -  3-4  3-6

 Head/Arms/Hands/Legs/Boots:
   nonprotective          -   0   1
   light                  -   1   1
   medium                 -  1-2  2
   heavy                  -  2-3 2-3

-Max ac items will not carry specials except in extreme circumstances, which
 should fit the following criteria: rarity (no more than 1/3 chance of being
 cloned), extremely dangerous mob, probably in a PK area, and being limited in
 some manner as to levels or who can wear it.
-Legacy gear will be automatically adjusted, due to absence of a flag to be
 set in future armors, to appropriate weight based on the ac, type, and if it
 has a special or not.
-Armor will set a restriction level in living.c, which guilds can query, so 
 they can set appropriate penalties for using heavier gear than they allow.
-The range of carry capacity will be adjusted - lower chars having far more
 capacity than they currently have.  Strength will account for much, but a 
 total noob (level 1, str 10) will be able to carry reasonable gear.
-The accessory items will have 0 ac in ALL cases.  Specific adjustments can be
 made for special items like the e-gear, etc.  In those cases, it will be 
 magical protection, meaning based on specials and dtype (physical allowed)
 protections.  AC will mean armor class though, and nothing that isn't armor
 will have Ac.
-We should implement better item statting.  I'm 100% in favor of allowing 
 players to have full stats (minus special information) on gear.  See below.
-Randomization to some extent of gear stats.  In other words, something that
 grants 10% magical protection should actually grant 5% +- random(5).  This
 will make the best stuff more unique, and in combination with allowing the
 players full statistical knowledge, will help us create an actual economy.
-An auction system.  Taking advantage of the above steps, combined with the
 forced diversity that this system will foster - between guild reqs, armor
 restriction/encumbrance levels/randomness/knowledge - will foster major 
 progress in moving toward a cap-less and full economy.
-Gear-induced stat modifiers.  This will go more hand-in-hand with possible
 future races and stat changes.  Not as important right now, but it should be
 kept in mind.
-Narrower range of item values.  Shit worth 200k is foolish.
