I may not be on track here, but I find myself wondering how the current proposed changes (which are many and fairly complicated) will be introduced into a game that has, for the most part, had its parameters in place for a good long time.  We have players (at least a few still) who will be confused....or feel 'out of it'.  If the game is going to be changed to a large extent, would it not be better to make an 'alt' mud, change it up, and then let people log in and try it out?  I also wonder how in the worl



I'm sorry to leave this unanswered for so long, but I wanted to make sure I
could put a comprehensive reply together.  This is stuff I've had floating 
around in my head for quite a while, so I want to make sure I respond as 
clearly as possible.

For starters:  Nirvana is a dying MUD.  I don't know that anyone wants to hear
or accept this, but it's a fact.  If you look at Nirvy over the last what, 
four, six, eight, ten years, it's steadily losing playerbase.  One or two 
fewer players average per night, per year, perhaps, but it's dying.  What's 
happing is we're not attracting or retaining new players, and gradually the 
older players develop real-lives, or are kicked in the ass by their RLs.  They
don't return, and we're not gaining new players at the same rate we lose them.
This is a slow attrition, but it's a fact of life.  This is the reason, plain
and simple for trying to introduce any changes all - to reverse this.

Now, the older players are going to leave - in my own case, I've burnt out at
times, and the eight or nine years I was gone from here were due to real-life.
I'm a returned player, and yes, this happens fairly often.  It doesn't happen
often enough to compensate for the loss of players.  In any case, there's no
mud in existance that doesn't lose players - to the MMORPGs like WoW and
Everquest, or whatever, to girlfriends, wives, kids, prison (heh), the USMC,
or military service in general, rl in general, or whatever.  This is a fact 
of life for any MUD.  The key is to replace those players with new ones.

This is an ancient MUD.  I actually enjoy working on this MUD for that reason.
I'll bitch and moan and gripe as much as anybody else about things that don't
work like they should, if at all, and the pain in the ass it is to change 
anything, but I've had a long history here, and the administration and pbase
has as well.  This is something you can't replace, period.  The problem is
that it's ancient in its systems.  Combat is clunky and obsolete, the chars 
all use the same gear, there's no individuality, and syntax here is simply
incomprehensible to most.  I am, usual flap aside, an extremely competant 
player, and recently I've brought over one of the best players from another
MUD, and he's had the same thoughts that I did learning this game:  it's 
simply too piecemeal, the syntax isn't consistent enough, it's too simple in
some areas (player creation, lack of races, etc) and too ridiculously complex
in others: clunkiness of the save system, the weird exceptions for attribs, 
hell, who thinks to type 'help attribs' - the inferior help file system, etc.

I've been thinking over these issues for years, and as most players and 
developers here are aware, I've been gaining input on one topic or another
almost continuously during my time.  I don't have all the answers, so I seek 
them out from others.  What the problems boil down to is the following:
  Poor noob interface:  they are clueless, they don't gain appreciably in
    power, they don't know what makes them more powerful - levels, stats, 
    etc, they don't understand the game.  Noob areas are all over the place,
    some of them aren't truly noob areas, noobs can't carry even minor gear, 
    syntax is a nightmare, and we don't have a really professional or modern
    looking interface, in general.
  We're very limited.  Combat is ridiculously repetitive.  It's too 
    simplistic, the only things to consider are healing and making sure to use
    your one spell per round.  There's no variance, it's just different guilds
    with different commands.  Use aliases, it's all the same guild.  I know
    this sounds harsh, and some of you might argue, but the fact is, that's 
    what it all boils down to.  If you really want to argue the point, send me
    a tell or mail.
  Every player basically the same.  There's very little variance in the high
    end gear or chars.  They all max all stats eventually, they all use the
    same gear when they can get it, etc.
  Guilds make no sense.  Why does my bcm have no differences in combat than a
    knight other than emotes?  A knight should be physically-oriented, the
    mage more magical.  There's entire essays to be written about this subject
    but I'm cutting it off here.
  Saved items:  this is terrible.  Most chars can't even store their base
    slots - of which there are too many, admittedly.  My bcm can store most
    but not all of the gear - ALL OF WHICH - he equips generally.  It's also
    very confusing and difficult to grasp for new chars, and primitive by the
    standards of most modern, high player-base muds.
  Gear makes no sense.  It's obvious what's the best - the lightest, max ac
    item that has the best specials.  If you don't see the problem with this, 
    then you don't need to be reading this at all, stick to playing the game.
  Pk pointless: there's actually a lot to be written on this, but the core 
    issues are being addressed by verte and me, and there's a large-scale
    project going on by pain, jenny, me, other wizards for that as well.
  Misc issues: not going into them here, but there's a lot heh :)

This leaves the solutions and the reasons for them as the next topic.  What 
I'm trying to do first is to streamline the attributes - we currently have 10
that some of which do things, some don't, some depend, nobody knows.  What's
the tradeoff between spending exp on levels or stats or guild?  Those are too
difficult of questions for noobs to be considering.  Let's streamline this and
let them know exactly what each stat is responsible for, let's make them go up
each level, so they can focus on tradeoffs between guild levels and spending
exp on levels.

Next topic is races:  every player is currently the same.  This is boring, 
it's foolish for balance, and irritating for players and guilds.  Let's put in
some true graces, some true differences, let players choose and customize 
their chars on a fundamental level.

Skills.  This is one of my major goals.  The skill system I'm working on
implementing is the single-most addictive system I've ever seen.  It's similar
to the old warrior guild, but it's even more intuitive.  It makes sense, it
facilitates things for guilds, and makes guildless chars viable.  My main 
interest is addicting new players - when they see their skills shooting up 
from the first fight they are in, and continuing to raise, it gives them a
sense of accomplishment.  This is important for retaining noobs.

Gear.  This is essential for everything else, and it's going to be unpopular
initially, but it's a simple necessity for guilds and skills.

The last topic is the problems.  My single biggest debate with myself on this
is, does this change the fundamental nature of Nirvana.  Well, what I've 
finally come to decide is that yes, it does, and no, it's not a bad thing.  
Like I said, Nirvana is dying.  One can deny this or refuse it, or close their
eyes to it, but the fact is Nirvana is declining.  Something needs to be done,
and that something is modernization.  My goal plain and simple is to increase
the playerbase.  The ways to do this are to simplify the mud's syntax, make
it's core commands more professional in appearance, enhance the help files, 
make learning the mud more intuitive, and most importantly, ADDICT them.

In any case, I'm sorry this runs so long, I've actually tried to keep it as
brief as possible.  If there's a subject anyone wants elaboration on, I'll be
happily to provide it, but I'd ask that they talk to players, talk to newbies,
look at the game as a newbie, remember what it was like when you were a newbie
and just look at this with an open mind.  

To answer the question from an implementation standpoint: 
I'm doing this piecemeal, just a bit here, a bit there, and I've  
been talking to players more or less nonstop on this.  I have an  
open invitation for them to 'beta' these changes, and I'm making an 
extreme effort to keep them in the loop. 
 
From a code end, well, it's a pain in the ass, plain and simple. 
I'm going to have everything legacy supported of course - that's  
what makes this a pain in the ass.  I'd actually now rather do this 
stuff this way rather than on an alt mud, simply because they can 
see the progress, and it's less to learn for any given player.   
 
It will be less of a shock this way, it will be gradual, and most 
of the players will pretty much know what's going on, plus for  
every 'nerfing' that happens, it can be balanced with a positive. 
 
Anyways, I'm handling the code-end, and I can elaborate on exactly 
what I'm doing if you're really that interested.
