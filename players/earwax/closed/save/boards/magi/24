i don't need a command for manual adjustments, should automatically
happen now, i just added some highly ghettoish code to the guild object,
so that if someone like cerberus is handed a guild object it auto updates
the hierarchy.....nothing is necessary

if one proves to be necessary, later on, i'll fix it, but until then
i'm not gonna fuck with it, just gonna slap in the hierarchy command
for now.

reason i'm doing it ghetto style right now instead of the right way, is
just to get it working until i can recode the guild object

with the way the guild object is right now, it's brutal trying to follow
certain parts of it, especially the init(), so it'll be easier for me
to work with it if i just recode the whole goddamn thing, and way simpler
for you guys to make future changes, if it's in a more manageable format
