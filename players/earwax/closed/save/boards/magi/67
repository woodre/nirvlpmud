I removed some shit, remove whatever we don't need on here anymore, i 
just basically removed shit from top down
anyways, gonna be working on tracker this week, hope to have it ready very very soon
i'll try to keep you guys posting, will need a TON of play-testing...as 
soon as it gets beyond the phase where it requires me to be logged on to
test it (for certain debugging procedures i'm doing right now, it's a 
requirement), you guys can have at it....check points and stuff and make sure
everything goes smoothly with it, hopefully we'll be at this point in a
week, i need to do up the background shit to display the actual pk files tho
anyways, i'll hopefully be able to keep you guys posted shortly with some 
good news, so i can get to work on shard shit and get our beloved bastard chars
back in the bad graces of all the nirvanans again :)

btw, someone please make servants and hierarchy commands look spiffy :)
