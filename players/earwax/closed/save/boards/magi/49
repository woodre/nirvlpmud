It's in, it works.  Look at include/sample.c to see the grotto revamped.
I realize it seems like a pain in the ass to do items that way, but really,
It's not.  If it's the same description for 2 or more items, just set up
a function to show the item description and put the function name instead of
the description in add_item().

I'm sure you guys can figure out how to use it, the inheritable itself is 
well-documented.  Lemme know what you think.

For the dark room, make sure in on_create() you use set_light(-1) to 
make it dark, the default I have is light level 1.

Note: do NOT use reset() or init()

for things that only happen on creation, use on_create().
for things like boards or mobs that you check for the presence of every
reset, use on_reset().  instead of init() use on_init() for additional
add_actions.  do NOT override the look command, long(), short() 
what i mean by that is, don't use long() or short() functions in the rooms.
use set_short() and set_long().  You can even set them to functions, but
you shouldn't need to, the inheritable will do all the work for you, just
set the shardak short, otherwise non-shards see 'the grotto' for everywhere.
for long, it automatically adds the short if they don't have detail mode,
automatically adds the exits for shards.

for throne room, simply put the long description in under set_long(), then
have a + extra_long()
in extra_long() if it's a shardak, add the presence note, if it's not, just
don't add anything.  very easy, any problems, lemme know, any suggestions,
lemme know.
