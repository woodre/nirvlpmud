Good idea.
To add to that, if I can figure out how, I'm gonna put it so if/when a player leaves the shardak army, 2 things will happen.
1.  Their title automatically gets set to something along the line of "Deserter of Shardak, -name- the eternal pussy. (lame)
2. Their pk will automatically be reset after Shardak ass-rapes them.
Any thoughts?
