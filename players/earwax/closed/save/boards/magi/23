need to figure out how to handle this

do we allow them to know how far to next guild level, and allow them
to store exp, or just not allow them to know how much exp is necessary,
or leave it as is

lemme know, if we start storing exp (converting it like warriors or ninja)
i need to know now, so i can go ahead and start implementing, it'll be
a major pain in the ass, but if you guys think it's worth it i'll do it.

lemme know how you guys feel i should handle it

gpromote, the joinroom, and abandon guild have all been updated to 
automatically change the rank of a member for servants and hierarchy
commands, just have to do a command or two up for magi to remove members
or update manually, although i'll add a check to the guild object to make
sure, so that when a player quits, their rank is saved, or so that when
the guild object clones to them it checks...i kinda like the second one
better so i'll go with that direction, that way we can clone the object
to a cerberus, and it'll automatically update, so he doesn't join manually
and fuck everything up
