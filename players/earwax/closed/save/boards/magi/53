This will be a little bit ugly, so it'll wait til tomorrow or the
weekend, not sure when I'll have time to do the looking up stuff for this.
It won't be that hard, just tedious, cuz I have to make calls to the two
different guilds to determine what their base exp is, and then check what
they have, the difference is their free.  It's not hard, just annoying,
although there's something existing in the guild object I want to read up
on, but that'll take a bit of research :(

It's pretty cryptic, and from my first glance through it, i don't even 
understand how or WHY it works, it shouldn't, but i also just spent about
45 seconds looking at it hehe
