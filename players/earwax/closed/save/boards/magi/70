I've been laid off basically.  Bar is being sold, etc, so I will 
be on very very little in the near future.  I'll get one when I can, but
I don't have access from home, my car is dying, and frankly I'm too stressed
on finding a job right now to worry about too much else at this moment.

I'll get on when I can, and I'll email you guys with stuff to put in if
I can, or upload it myself and get it in if I can, but I don't have very
much time or patience, at least as of today :(

Really sorry, I saw this coming, because everything has been pointing at it,
but there wasn't much I could do.  
my email addy is dhalek3@yahoo.com if you need it, dunno if I'll be able
to check email any more often than I'll be able to check in on the mud
itself, but you never know heh.
