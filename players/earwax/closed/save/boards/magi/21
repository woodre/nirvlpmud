I removed the inherit of verte's room.c and changed it to room/room.c
I did this so I wouldn't have to fuck with the item shit in his 
inheritable, some buggy stuff with it when you override long() and I 
figured this was easier for now.  I went ahead and did it myself, since
pulling an inheritable means a lotta things have to be looked at, so
I added a manual exit for out, and added an add_action() for look, that
manually does everything involved, or just returns to the standard look
for anything else, since 'look at bag' would be overridden in there too,
the way it was.  lemme know any problems that arise, it should be kosher
tho.
