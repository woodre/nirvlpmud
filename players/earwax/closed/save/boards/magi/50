took me less than 5 minutes to update it....all i did was make sure
that anything in create or reset was moved to on_create(), removed the
::create() and ::reset(arg) and so on of course, and changed the exits/
items functions

just look at it, see that only 3 functions are in it really, other than
the necessary board ones....on_create() on_reset() and on_init() would be
there...

change the inherit for the rooms to GHALL, btw, instead of ROOM or whatever
room file they inherit
