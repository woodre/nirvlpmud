It's written, in include/ghall.c

take a look at it, should be fairly straightforward, just read the 
documentation for it at the front.  I still have to debug it, this is so
you guys can get an idea of how to use it.  Hopefully I'll be back on in
an hour or two to debug it and set up a sample room.
