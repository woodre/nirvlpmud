Had a thought....
How about the guild ranking (berzerker, master, etc) being pretitle
Their guild level being their title...(figure up appropriate ones for each)
or letting players choose guild level or a simple 'the servant of shardak' as their
title.  I'll set it up so that their guild title sets automatically, so even if they
have it changed, it won't stick.  Just a random thought that i wanted to
get down before i forgot it.

I kind of like the look of :
Master Spyder the Servant of Shardak.
Berzerker Assnugget the Initiate of Shardak
Novice BootNoob the Supplicant of Shardak
Magistrate Morpheus the Favored of Shardak

dunno, random thought like i said, lemme know what you guys think
