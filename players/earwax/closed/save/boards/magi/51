OK....test chars will now be filtered.
The filterees so far are: waxman, moso, linusjr, numberone - numberfive
Any others I should add, let me know.  Now, if an object is removed from
somebody without them abandoning guild, or it's a testchar or wiz that 
shouldn't be on the roster, you can manually remove them with 
rservant <name>
Use with care.

Going off the old hierarchy, i changed my guild status to 'high magus'
just to differentiate, sorry guys, heh, but probably should have who is
the head wiz up there, makes things a lot more understandable for people.

the hierarchy daemon will automatically update itself as members join, logon,
whatever

just needs better formatting heh, but i'm not worried on that, i have a lot
of other coding to do, including putting the new and improved version of
the guild object in, and debugging (ugh that'll be a bitch), as well as 
adding room echoes to the rooms, as well as getting that last task added in.

as soon as your guys work is done, we're about ready to open, my shit will be
done before opening, regardless.  Hopefully less than a week til open.
