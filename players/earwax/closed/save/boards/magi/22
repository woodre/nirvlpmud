it's rough, but it works thus far

lemme know what you guys think
whichever of you wants to add headers to it and so on, feel free :)
to add the headers, do it in daemons/hierarchy.c 
the servants function is dump_members() 
the hierarchy command (or whatever it's named) will be dump_hierarchy()
to add headers and neaten it up at that point
you'll get the idea on where to put stuff when you look at it
