I added color to the heal items descriptions.  
For some reason the elixer of life pulls out the default price of 10000 and
when trying to buy it from the imp, get a "There is no such thing " message (the fail)
Pls take a look.  I'm not 100% sure how mappings and the like work
so I may have fucked something up?
