i did 500 trials with the demon blade (neutral align tho) and 500
with dblade + slayer

i got 11.14 average for just the dblade
and about 19.8 for with the slayer

now, keep in mind, dblade is a shitty weapon (wc 18) if you don't have
evil align, if you do, it averages out to around 18.6 or some shit, 
effective weapon class (1/3 of the time it returns 2 or some shit like
that), but even so, the point was to see the difference slayer sword
makes, and if it's about right.  I'd say 9 additional damage per round
is well worth it, and yet still has to be very legal, especially 
considering the penalties with it.

thank vital for that, apparently, since he was the one working on that,
guess it DID actually get fixed before we closed :)
