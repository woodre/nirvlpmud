Shardak Guild Levels

The way these work is the base exp is what a guild level costs if the player
has maxed all three sacrifice categories (personal, material, pk).  This is
not so hard to do at lower guild levels but gets progressively more difficult
as they get higher in glevel.  The base exp is 1/4 of what the maximum exp
to get a guild level is.  In other words, 10 mil to max the guild with 100%
values for each tox level each guild level means 40 mil to max the guild with
0% in each tox level each guild level.

Titles are tentative, I need better ones.
Note that the gains in offense and defense follow the rough percentages, plus
there are guild stat gains each level, and that all abilities and gains in 
offense/defense are based on both glevel AND a guild stat, or 2 guild stats.

Note also that at guild level 3 the char gains the ability to hear the guild
channel and at guild level 5 they gain the ability to use the guild who and
guild channel commands (muffle, ability to use the channel tell/emote).

The following are the proposed maximum protections and offensive enhancements.
Keep in mind that there is no shield, so the damages reflect that loss.  The
general gains come at various costs, and are guild stat and guild level 
dependant.  It's very difficult to max stats, more so even than maxing the 
guild itself.  10-40 mil to max the guild (most players will fall within that
range somewhere) is rough, plus the additional effort to max the stats, plus
the trials for each guild spell, plus sacrifices, plus following the theme,
not being able to party (except with shards), plus other costs make this guild
a deceptively difficult one to advance through.  I feel these figures are more
than balanced by the difficulty that will be inherent, and are thematic as well.

Defensive Maximums (Dtypes)
Evil     80%
Fire     50%
Physical 20%
Magical  20%

Offensive Maximums
20-30 additional points of damage per round (addition to weapon damage, 
they will not have a spell_object() spell in the conventional sense).
This will be random damage, but as they get higher in glevel it will become less
random. 
This will go off whichever is higher, their evil or fire or physical based stat,
eventually they will also have a trial to gain the ability to use whichever one
that a particular mob or player is weakest to automatically, which will require
that they have those 3 guild stats maxed, in order to be at its most effective.

I have an alternate damage scheme listed, in case the 30 damage is considered
too high, or to give an alternate method type of calculating, in case the 
guaranteed damage each round is too much.  I'm open to suggestions and 
alterations, I'm debating adding in additional costs, such as an sp cost each
round, or a sac cost, or an exp cost, or some combination, or doing the costs in
rounds of exceptional damage, I'm still figuring that end of things out.  In 
any case, this is all here to show some possibilities and I'd like to get some
input regarding what I have.

Glevel     Damage       Range   Alternate Damage   Range

  2       2+random(13)   2-14   ran(11)+ran(3)     0-12

  7       7+random(18)   7-24   ran(11)+ran(8)     0-17
  8       8+random(19)   8-26   ran(11)+ran(9)     0-18
  9       9+random(20)   9-28   ran(11)+ran(10)    0-19
 10      10+random(21)  10-30   ran(11)+ran(11)    0-20

Last note: gen_wc_prof() or whatever fun i plan on having it so that
it is 1 per glevel.
