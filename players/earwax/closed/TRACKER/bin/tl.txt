 *
 * Talks on the Trackers Flap Line
 *
 * Earwax 7/28/03 - Jareel 9/14/03
 *
 * *************************************************************************
 * 
 * 
 * Usage for the will be 'tl <enter flap here>
 * 
 * As of 9/14/03 only players with PK set or Players in a PK
 * area will be allowed to Flap on this line.  I am rethinking 
 * this as I like when people Flap.
 *
 * The line should look like this.
 * 
 * [PK Legend] Orb says: I'd rather kill an Elite Knight than Beat my Meat.
 * [Tracker] EliteRandom says: Heh
 * [Legend] Cooper says: Why not try me Orb?
 * [Pk Legend] Chant says: Your a pussy Cooper shut up...8)
 *      
 * The channel I would like to have on the channel show the players who are 
 * 
 * Legends -------------------- In Bold White
 * Pk Legends ----------------- In Red
 * Both PK and Normal Legends - Bold Red
 * Just a Tracker-------------- Bold Black
 * 
 * Would make Flapping on the channel more impressive for the players who
 * achieved Legend or Pk legend Status.  Separating them from the pack
 *
