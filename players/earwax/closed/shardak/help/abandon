               Servants of Shardak - Abandon - Earwax 7/03


Once you leave the guild you can never rejoin.  This is not debatable, it's
not arguable, and there's nothing that can be done about it.  I have added
a fair amount of code to ensure that it never happens.

If you get a player to invite you to the guild, and you type 'join' you will
be executed by Shardak.  Period.  Shards will joyously invite you, just to
watch you die.  Don't whine, you know the penalty ahead of time.

If you get a wizard to give you a guild object, Shardak will immediately
execute you.  A guild wizard (Magus) will not do this, no matter what.  This
has been implemented so that if a non-Magus tries to get you into the guild,
you pay the price.  You will die full death (execution), lose everything on
your corpse, etc, and lose the guild object.
