            Servants of Shardak - Inactive - Earwax 7/03


Inactive means that you will be gone from the mud for at least a year, and
don't want your character purged (only occurs once a year, and only chars
that haven't logged on in at least a year are purged).  

I don't want inactive fucks who will be gone from the mud in my guild, 
clogging up the membership lists.  Either you leave the guild and go
inactive, or you take your chances and don't go inactive, and hope not to 
get purged.  

Once you leave the guild, you can't rejoin it.  Period.  Your guild file
will be deleted.  See 'shardak abandon' for more information.  Don't even
attempt to have a wizard clone you an object, it won't work.  

The only option you have other than the ones I mentioned, is to talk to 
me (Earwax).  If you have a strong case, I'll back up your guild file, and
if you come back in a year or more, I'll be happy to give you a guild object
again.  I don't want inactive fucks in this guild, and I've seen all too 
often where somebody gets pissed off and goes inactive, only to be whining
two days later that he can't logon.  That shit won't happen in this guild.
