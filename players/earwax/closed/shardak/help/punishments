           Servants of Shardak - Punishments - Earwax 7/03


There are a few different punishments available in this guild.

First is a warning.  These may or may not occur.  Most likely not.  All 
members are assumed to know and understand the rules of the guild before 
they join.  This is a PK guild, and a quasi-military order.  We're under
strict discipline in some areas, and warnings are not part of that 
discipline.  Very rarely will these happen, so don't count on them.

Freeze.  All combat powers get frozen.  This isn't fun, you can't do much of
anything while frozen, so it's a good first warning, to get somebody's 
attention.  It's also the step taken before Magus intervention.  If someone
is frozen it means they fucked up enough to where the person shouldn't be
able to do shit until a Magus talks with them, and either removes them from
the guild (after multiple executions), or unfreezes them.

Execution.  This is the primary punishment.  You fuck up, you lose your
life.  This is full death - experience, stat, level, and gear loss.  
Whatever would happen to you with a regular death will happen to you here.
Don't whine if you break a rule and just get executed.  Don't take it
personally, just don't break rules.
