Guild Object

loader.c     Autoloaded.  Clones/moves gob to player.

gob.c:
The guild object itself.  Mainly it's the raw object setup stuff.
My intent is to keep it mainly as a variable bag, as guild objects should
be.  The definitions for stats all use GStats[] btw, just for ease of 
use, although the programmer in me kinda disagrees with the practice.

other files will be inherited through it and commented later.
