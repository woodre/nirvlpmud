Working With Shard Stats - Earwax 1/16/04

The following conventions are used with working with our stat system.
All our stats are stored in an array - usually named GStats (as it is in the
gob), but whatever you name it in a given command will work.

The names are the index number in the array that corresponds to a given
stat.  What this means is that ARCANA is array index 0.

To access them:

arcana = GStats[ARC] (or ARCANA)

 0  ARCANA (ARC)
 1  MAGIK  (MGK)
 2  CONFLAGRATION (CON)
 3  RANCOR (RAN)
 4  FERVOR (FER)
 5  DOMINATION (DOM)
 6  SUBJUGATION (SUB)
 7  WRATH (WRA)

 8  GLEVEL
 9  GRANK
10  SAC_POOL
11  GEXP

Other stats, info will be added here over time if necessary.
