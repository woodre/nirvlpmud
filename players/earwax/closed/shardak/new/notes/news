[1;30m01/16/04 16:54[2;37;0m[2;37;0m: Changed the syntax of function declarations to simplify things.  Now, you just use int main(string arg, int *GStats)

The information for these is: spell name, cost (hp, sp, component, sac pool, exp, cash, whatever), affects (be explicit and thorough), glevel required, what effectiveness is based off (2 guild stats, or 1 guild stat and guild level...see the stats explanation in notes), task outline ALL SPELLS REQUIRE THIS ... what the task is, how player will know about it, exactly what the task is....put these writeups in /players/earwax/closed/shardak/new/doc

If you have any input or interesting ideas on the matter, check out /players/earwax/closed/shardak/new/notes/wyrm.forbin and mudmail me.  Also, I plan to take Jaraxle's map and start a working ghall...no pretty descrips as of yet, just basic roominess.  Any input is appreciated.
