  The Dark Hermit stares at you with his death-black eyes,
and leaps into a combat stance, as if to attack you. He
spies the Mark upon your right hand and eases his tension.

  "Praise the Dark. You come from the Master? I am not one
of his Servants, merely an Ally in the fight against Good.
However, I have a spell which He has allowed me to teach over
the years. It is the summoning of the Infernal Storm, a
powerful magik indeed. For this, I ask for you to return with the
Magik Trinity, each which represents an aspect of the Storm."

 You gaze into his eyes and see the following:

		 ~ The Staff of the Wizards
		 ~ The Staff of the Magus
		 ~ The Staff of the Lich

  He nods at you and says, "Once this task is complete, and
these staves are within my grasp, I will grant you the power
which you seek." He turns away from you in dismissal.
