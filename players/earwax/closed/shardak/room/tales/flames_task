  The pyromancer's eyes blaze contentedly.  "Ah," he begins,
"you wish to pass this trial of Lord Shardak's, hmm?"
  You nod at him as he continues.  "Eons ago, when the Master
was trapped within this accursed rock, the very flames that
ignited the unholy depths of Hell were stolen away and hidden,
so the evil with which they pierced the countryside would
not burn again..."
  He smiles.  "Shardak requires a constant vigil of this
hell's fire to be kept within this place, so that he
may draw his power from it.  These same flames will imbue
you with the power to conjure them...   But you must
first light the flame of an eternal torch, the magical
torches found in the trade city of Ryllian, from the
flame of these flames, found within volcanic caverns
to the east of the fields of the Third Earth.
Do this, and bring it back to me, and powers
beyond a mortal's comprehension will be yours."
  He smiles thinly.
