  The demon turns his gaze towards you and bares its ebony-white
fangs in a frightening but well-meaning smile. With a perculiar
choice of words, it commences to speak, "Ah, the Trial, is it?
Thou must pass it to increase your Ability with Magik."
  "And help me in the same Stroke too," it adds, "You see, in my
Position, One needs plentiful of teleportation Energy. And since
I am almost always low, Thou canst find me an Object filled with
such Energy. Has it enough to move me to the Outside, I shall
share some of my Secrets with Thee."
  The demon beckons you on your way.
