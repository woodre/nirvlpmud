  The imp cackles wildly, "hehehe. so, you wish to learn
the imp's secrets, hmm??? hahahaha."
  It snorts derisively and grins, showing a layer of
sharp, inch-long teeth. "easier said than done! hahaha.
the imp requires one thing, to learn the powers the imp
shall grant you.  ehehehe."
  The imp skips around, then it whirls around to face you.
"heheh," it laughs, "hold a bolt of lightning aloft in
the ayre of power you must, and with it the dark aura from
the archfiend from the land of the fallen. holding both aloft,
and receiving your unearthly prize, and giving this to the imp
are all one must do." It chitters and looks away from you,
uninterested.
