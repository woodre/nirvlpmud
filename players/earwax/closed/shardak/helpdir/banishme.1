	  |/    |    Shardak  holds  immense  power and    |
	       /    cannot die.  It has  happened that    /
	      |    Shardak was  defeated in combat by    |
	      |    a  band  of strong  warriors,  and    |
	     /    thus  banished  from  this  realm.    /
	    |    From limbo  Shardak cannot  return    |
	    |    before he  has cast  the spell  of    |
	     \    Return  from  Banishment.  You can    \
	      |    speed up  His  return  by  sending    |
	       \    great  sums  of mana  to  Shardak.    \
