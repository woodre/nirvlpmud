	      |    The shop-keeper will only stay for    |
	     /    a short while  after you have made    /
	    |    your summoning.  In addition,  the    |
	    |    person who called the merchant can    |
	     \    also  dismiss  it.  Dismissing the    \
	      |    shop-keeper  swiftly will  yield a    |
	       \    little mana.                          \
