   The Warrior
  - ------ - ------- - ------- - -- --------- -----

   The Warrior is the grunt, the brute force of the
   Shardak fighting force.  The Warrior spills blood
   upon the battlefield, licks his wounds, and comes
   back again to reign bloodlust upon the lands.
   The Warrior will obey his commanders and observe
   the Path of the Shardak through Death and beyond.
   The Warrior has risen slowly through the ranks
   and is truly a creature to be feared.
