                                    [Demons]
                                    03.19.02


Overview

This guild is based on giving players a demonic link to another
plane of existence.  This will show in the form of changing the
players appearance, giving them spell-like powers, or other
abilities.  A demon gains in power by offering it to other 
non-demon players.  Each time the demon successfully gets a
player to sign a pact, giving that player a bonus in something,
they will gain guild xp.  As they gain guild xp, they will
have new opportunities to commune with a higher plane and
increase their own abilities.  
The Demons main purpose is to create pacts with other players.
This will mean tricking them, as much as is allowed, and
roleplaying.  Afterall, getting someone to sell you their soul
is usually a little tough.

Guild Structure

The guild is based on a 20 level system.  Each level is gained
automatically as guild experience is earned.  Guild experience
is only earned through pacts.  Player level is completely
separate and still requires combat.

As the player gain in guild level, they receive a point to
spend in pacts.  These pacts can go toward new skills,
spells, etc.  Some of these abilities will be cumulative,
allowing you to put more than one point into it.  Some
abilities require having another ability first.

Price Choices

What this means is, when you make a pact with another player,
you decide what it is you want from them.  This can take
the form of hps, sps, coins, etc.  When you make a pact,
the pact will also exact some price from you to fulfill 
it.

Hps:  Takes so many hps.
Sps:  Takes so many sps.
Hps & Sps: Takes both.
Coins: Coins...
Stats: You can take one or more stats from the player.
Delayed Hps:  At some point in the future, at your discretion,
              you can take hps from the player.
Delayed Sps:  Same as above, only sps.
Delayed Hps & Sps: same as above, only both.
Sacrifice:  They must sacrifice an item, wife, child, etc.
Soul:  You can take their life, whenever you choose.

The cost of the pact will depend on what you choose.  For instance,
if you choose hps, it might require 200, whereas for coins, it might
take 5000.  Some pacts require too much of one thing, and the demon
will need to balance this with two or more prices.

Some pacts require certain types of costs, on top of what
is chosen.  For instance, sps for you to heal someone, even
if you choose to have them spend coins.

A pact cannot be gained through pure deception.  The pact
will notify them of the full cost when they read it.
 


Demon Domains

At rank 15 the demon gains a home/domain.  This is a one
room place where they can be safe.  Each level beyond
15, they gain an additional room.  Each additional room
must be chosen from a list, and has a specific power to
it.

6 rooms total.
