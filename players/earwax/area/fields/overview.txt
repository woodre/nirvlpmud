Earwaxian National Guard Fields

- Earwax 12/03

This area is a group of fields, with a guard shack, located 4w, all n from the green.  There are a number of wandering national guard soldiers to kill, all mid-level, and a little bit of coinage here.  The guards all are rather incompetant, and proud of it generally.  This area will be to the south of where I'd like to put a castle, complete with dungeons and portals and all that nonsense.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rooms:  (~/area/fields/room/)

26 rooms altogether, one of them has a hidden entrance, and another is 
specifically for having a place to keep NPC's out of the only real special room in the place: sanctuary.

The sanctuary allows accelerated healing, a slight change in alignment (makes knights, rangers, bards more good, dark order, shards more evil), is a no-fight room, and an NPC-free zone.  Mobs that enter are moved into an NPC room, but can follow out of there when their owner leaves.



Items:  None (swords are cloned from /obj/weapon and directly to the mob)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monsters: (~/area/fields/room/mon/mob_setup.c and mob_daemon.c)

The mobs are cloned from /obj/monster.c and configured in mob_setup.
The daemon runs them, has them getting items from the floor, looting any 
corpses they come across, attacking beanos, and wandering around.

They all follow the rules in the monster guide for ac/wc/coins/level
