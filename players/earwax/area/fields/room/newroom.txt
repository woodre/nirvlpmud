from fields4.c ... change moat desc to give better indication
something to effect of oddly there's nothing swimming in it here
and perhaps a 'you might be able to dive into the moat here safely'
they try to dive without the apparatus it won't let them
if they have it, drop them into the moat, disallow e,w but give descs
that there's some nasty stuff over there
oddly enough here there's no signs of life
there's an odd formation in the bottom here ....
search bottom, triggers the moat-monster
250k mob, drops nothing
then they can enter the cave
