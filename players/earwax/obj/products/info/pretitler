This item uses the codes established in 'help xtitle'.  Use that as a guide
for the color codes you can use with the pretitler.  Note: there is a
maximum length for pretitles, and color codes aren't figured into
it, at this moment (going to try to get that changed).

Note: use "\" as an escape char (to output a "$").  

Syntax: pretitle_me <new pretitle>

Pretitler is a one-use item.  It is used up after one use.
