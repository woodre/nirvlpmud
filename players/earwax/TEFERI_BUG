Amulet [gemstone] [gemstone]
[lore]  :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  [lore]
  Hanging from the end of a dyed black leather cord, this amazing amulet
seems to be composed of an unknown silver metal.  The amulet looks much
heavier than it actually is, leading you to believe that it may be one of
the fantastic metals only heard of in myths and legends.
  In the center of the amulet is a carving of a lone tree of good health.
In the background is a night scene, the moon rising up behind the tree
framing it perfectly.  You sense a calming aura coming from the amulet.
You notice that the moon is inlaid with gemstones and that the
stars are actually comprised of gemstone flakes.
