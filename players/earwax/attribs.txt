Attributes:

The following are the attributes we'll be switching to, as eventually were
hashed out by a buttload of wizzes.  Anyways as players gain a level they gain
perhaps 5 attrib points to distribute as they wish, perhaps a random stat will
raise automatically each level.  Max for each stat will be 30, to conform with
current standards; each race however, will have different maxes for each stat,
with 30 being the ceiling.  Stats will be more in control of a char's power
than level, but they gain stats through levels and xlevels.  Currently I don't
have anything planned for gaining stats in any way other than level, although
that may change.

strength:     damage bonuses in combat, carry capacity
dexterity:    chance to hit in combat, dodge, parry, skills etc
constitution: hp, hpr (regen rate), endurance points, epr
willpower:    innate resistances, willpower type checks, has an effect on ep
mental:       sp/spr, int/wis checks

racial, static stats: they either don't change, or aren't controlled by char:
luck:      they can 'roll' this stat at char generation
charisma:  also roll this at char generation, within limits set by race
size:      this will go up as they level, until they reach their max size
           also a rolled stat

Specifics:

HP: 10* con + 2*level + 2*xlevel 
    7  con at level 1  means 72  max hp - higher than now
    30 con at level 19 means 338 max hp - about equivalent to now

SP: 10* men + 3*level + 3*xlevel 
    7  men at level 1  = 73 
    30 men at level 19 = 357 

EP: 7*con + 3*wil + 2*level + 2*xlevel

HPR: racial modifier + con hp regen per minute, max of 60
SPR: racial modifier + men sp regen per minute
EPR: racial modifier + 2/3 con + 1/3 wil

current stat checks will be routed to the most appropriate stat

Implementation: these won't go fully into the game for general players until
this stuff has been thoroughly tested and races, gear changes, skills are
ready to go in as well, but they will be the first in for testing.
