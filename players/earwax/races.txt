Race Guidelines

Players have the following attributes:

Strength
Constitution
Dexterity
Willpower
Intelligence

They have the following racial attributes:
Luck
Charisma
Size

They also have the following racial modifiers to their regen rates:
Racial HPR
Racial SPR
Racial EPR

When creating a race you should consider as a starting point 120 total attrib
points for the main 5, with luck and charisma being 20.  No stat should be
above 35, and never should a race have 2 stats at 35.  If charisma or luck
are raised or lowered you should subtract/add half that amount to the base 
attribute pool.

When putting points into stat maxes, you should consider the following:

35: Extremely high
30: Very high
25: High
20: Normal
15: Low
10: Very Low
5:  Extremely low

Racial regeneration rates should be thematic for the race, and stats should be
balanced accordingly.  In other words, if you grant high regeneration rates
to a race, the overall stats should be lower.

Another aspect to consider is innate resistance levels to dtypes, special 
abilities, nightvision, innate disadvantages, etc.  Everything that goes into
a race should be considered balance-wise versus the other races.  Ideally, we
will have no one dominant race.  Every player can decide whether they would
rather have innate resistances, high stats, high regen rates, or whatever.

Also keep in mind that this is purely an initial 'guess' as to how races 
should be balanced.  Once we have figured out some races a better system can
be devised.
