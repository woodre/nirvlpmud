This directory contains the files for the Player Channel.
This was coded separate from the channel daemons to keep it mainly wizard
free.  Wizards will not show up on the who list no matter if they are vis or
not.  Wizards are also not allowed to use the channel, although they can
listen (though only on request please!).
