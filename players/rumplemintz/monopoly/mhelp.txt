Description
-----------

Mud Monopoly is played much like real Monopoly, but on a 'mud-life-size'
board.  This document assumes that you already know how to play Monopoly.
If not, type 'rules' to see the entire set of rules that came with the
Monopoly game (sorry if they seem antiquated, I wanted them to be as
authentic as possible, including the annoying usage of all-caps.
If you think you can figure it out, try 'help' or 'help topics' for a list
of commands.  You can also use the form 'help <command>' to get quick
information on a certain Monopoly command.

Starting the game
-----------------

Go to the Monopoly main entrance.  One of the players must name the game
and type in 'new <name>'  (for example, 'new jubalalwayswins')
Then, all the other players can join the game by: 'join <name>'
You can see the games currently in use by typing 'games'

Game play
---------

The game moves in normal fashion except for one major change.  The mud
version of Monopoly is a type of 'speed Monopoly.'  As long as everyone
is caught up to the turn that you are on, you can take your next turn at
any time.  This means that there can sometimes be races to buy a property
that people land on at the same time.  However, if any player is behind
one turn, none of the other players will be able to 'roll,' so don't take
too long.

The main commands for the game are:
  roll       roll the dice, take a turn
  buy        buy a property or a house
  sell       sell houses
  i          inventory
  l          (as in look).  Try looking at players and properties.

For dealing with other players:
  mwho       show all players and some info
  mshout     yell something to everyone in the game
  mgive      for making deals

And also, very important commands are:
  help       try the following arguments:  topics, id, and any command name
  rules      The authentic Monopoly rules
  return     Puts you back on the right space on the board
  exit game  exit the game

Deals
-----

Deals must be made as agreements between players.  There is no code
to enforce this, so its on the honor system.  Use the 'mgive' command.
Examples:
mgive boardwalk to jubal
mgive $1000 to jubal

Bankruptcy
----------

As soon as your amount of cash goes negative, you will be stuck in
bankruptcy.  You will be unable to move ('roll') until you go back
into positive amounts.  Your options are to try to mortgage
properties, sell houses, sell to other players, and so forth, in
order to get back up to positive amounts.  If you can't, then you
must exit the game.  You cannot just hold the game up until someone
gives you the money you need.

It is considered highly unfair to make a deal with a player that is
unbalanced just before quitting the game.  (For example, giving all
your property and cash to another player for $1 and then quitting)

Miscellaneous
-------------

If you are in brief mode, your descriptions will be without the ascii graphics.
(This includes houses and die rolls)

The Chance card: "Advance token to nearest utility" is not fully correct.
The original Monopoly had you pay 10 times the rent for landing there.
There was no easy way to implement this.

The cards are not really drawn from a 'stack' per se.  They are picked
randomly from all 16 cards, so it is possible to get the same card twice.
There was no easy way to implement this.

Each person can only have one Monopoly player at a time.

It is of course, unfair to use wiz powers to cheat at Monopoly.

It is unfair to join a game without the other players permission.

Check out the bleachers.  You can watch all the Monopoly games going on.

Known Bugs
----------

This really depends on how well the code is ported to the mud you are on.
Net dead players should be able to return to the game.  On some systems
this doesn't work, it has to do with when inventory is moved from the net
dead object to the new character.
