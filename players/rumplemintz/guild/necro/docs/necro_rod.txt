         The Realm of Death

     The Realm of Death is a pocket dimension tucked away and
     ajoining the Negative material plane. This small realm has
     a tremendous number of undead spirits and other entities within,
     feeding off the connection to the negative plane. Anyone upon
     Nirvana can contact these spirits through the use of sacrifice
     and spell-casting. They in turn grant powers to those who have
     the courage to allow contact with them, at great peril to the
     spellcaster. The spirits are known for taking more then they
     give, making it a risky business indeed. They feed off pain, 
     suffering and the energy that rot brings, reveling in those
     that would cower before them. 

     Necromancers here upon Nirvana have made a lifestyle of dealing
     with the spirits from the Realm of Death, knowing full well that 
     they too will soon embrace eternal sleep.
 
     And the spirits wait patiently for them...
