    [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]
         
         Grafting (miscellaneous)

     Necromancy spells not only call upon the Realm of Death to
     inflict pain and suffering upon Nirvana, but necromantic energy
     call also be reversed and be used to heal. This involves taking
     spell components such as skin and blood and directly applying
     them to the wounded areas upon ones body. This inflicts horrible
     scarring and much pain, but at least it does heal.

     Note -> This can be used upon yourself. graft <your name here>
