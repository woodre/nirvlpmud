It has been a refuge and place of peace for my tortured soul.  The realm of death has taught mewell....and I have prospered.  You too will do well to learn from the RoD. (Realm of Death)  All you need is contained inthis chamber.  Search it out.  If you find problems or errors,you may notify the RoD using 'nbug (message)'.  There is no one other than the RoD to guide us.  We each must find ourown way.  There are no rules, only the books.  If we chance tomeet in the realm of the living, so be it. **[1m...                                      [2;37;0m ( Sickness ):**I have finally found a way to be one with my deepest of torments.Thank you Mantis.SKNS**[1mKnowledge                                [2;37;0m ( Sid ):**Others can not give you the knowledge.The knowledge must come from the realm and from within.**[1mDeath's Dagger                           [2;37;0m ( Sagan ):**The dagger that you can claim from the Realm of Death is not mainly for the killing of foes, but more so for the ability to remove those precious components from theirliveless body.  It is for that reason that the Realm of Death supplies you witha very small and precise harvesting tool.  -Sagan**[1mLibrary of Knowledge                     [2;37;0m ( Mikoyose ):**The books are in the library for reference, for everyone.  Please refrain from toteing them around for extended periods.  Also the information contained in the books is for necromancers or those that would join us.  Therefore, please do not simply leave them sitting out in other parts of the realm.  Leave the books in the library if at all possible, for the sake of everyone involved.May death come swiftly,Mikoyose**[1mGuild Hall                               [2;37;0m ( Sagan ):**The guild hall has become more unfriendly to all.  -Sagan**[1mGuild Entrance                           [2;37;0m ( Sagan ):**The guild hall entrance has moved from Qual'tor to the Dryant graveyard.The monsters will now be slightly nicer to you than others.  Bewarethough as it is still dangerous.  -Sagan**[1mTypos                                    [2;37;0m ( Sebastian ):**Many typos of the guild books and hall descripts have been fixed.  I wouldlike to thank those that contributed to the nbug list, especially those thatnoted multiple typos and bugs.  If you do come across anymore please postthem through nbug <bug> and they will be fixed as soon as possible.Also the guild hall has now become a no follow zone.  This means thatnew recruits will have to use the portals or some other devious meansto join.  -sebastian**[1mBounty                                   [2;37;0m ( Fleshhunter ):**I placed a 10k bounty on Muerte's corpse.

So when the ROD informsyou of a death you'll be able to see to what.  Ideasubmitted by Unknown for thematic consideration.Fred**[1mNew Management                           [0m ( RoD ):**The Necromancer guild is under new management.Use 'nbug' to report bugs We'll be working on the animate zombie spell, as well as anyother TODO items left from past management.**[1mGuildhall Location                       [0m ( Renji ):**Some of you might not know how to get to our guild hall, or likewise get out so heres how you get to the guild hall5e,n,e,enter,angel, ask angel about the dryant graveyard,sw,w,w,s,s,se,e,s,enter crypt,d,n,pull rock,enter door,n,nAnd to leave is s,s,pull lever,enter door,s,u,out,n,w,nw,n,n,e,e,neand from there im sure you can find your own ways back to village green or wherever it is your everlasting tormented soul wishes to go.**"
