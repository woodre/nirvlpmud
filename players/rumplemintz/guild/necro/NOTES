Daranath's Second attempt to code a guild...

The Necromancers

Most of the help files are found in the docs directory.
hist1.txt thru hist4.txt lists Sagan's journey in developing the
style and powers of the guild. OUTLINE is the basic outline of the 
guild, for you wiz types that can read this. The basic abilities
and powers are listed within that doc. Of further note would be
parts_list.txt and level1.txt thru level10.txt plus avatar.txt
which list the individual powers of each guild rank. There will
be 3 avatars at any given time, and no more then 3 will
ever be allowed. If you decide to use the guildob.c for testing
as a wiz or a test char, please set the g_level of the 
testing player/char to g_level 12. This shows an inactive 
role in the guild itself, while still allowing for all spells
and abilities to be used.

I welcome all comments and suggestions for the guild... please
mail me if you do wish to share your opinion.
