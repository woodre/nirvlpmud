Sun Jan 25 13:53:14 1998 I dested Wocket's Orb off of Cross.  She asked me to because there was no way to get rid of it and Mizan had told them that they were to have no teleports, but that mini-guilds were ok to have.
Tue Apr 14 23:51:36 1998 Repaired teller.c so that it is not droppable and no one other than I can use it.
Tue Apr 21 19:39:14 1998 I imprisoned Wulfgar for getting the hinotori egg and dropping it on Village Road.  Isis and Acrimony died because of this.
Tue Apr 28 19:37:01 1998 Claudia's home was still set to the polys.  I changed it to the church.
Tue Jul 18 15:06:04 2000 Lower the cost on the title machine from 5k coins to 2500 coins.  Approved by Feldegast.  Reason: level restriction, and the very probable chances of getting a cheesy title, as the titles are preloaded
Tue Dec 30 02:17:38 2003 Updated The Teacher. Upped WC, Spell_dmg, Spell_chance and changed a few typos and a spell_msg
