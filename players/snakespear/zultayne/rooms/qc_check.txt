   I have gone through your area as you requested.  Generally, I
find it to be a very good first effort with considerable thought
having gone into the project.  I like the use of senses and the
different 'variations' to exits.  I did find some things you
fix before this area is put into play however.  Most are fairly
small but a couple will take some work on your part and you'll
have to go back through the rooms individually to take care of
them.

   Let's start with the biggest problem I found first.  It has to
do with your 'search_room()' function.  The idea is terrific but
in every case you have only 1 emote when, in fact, there might be
many.  I'll give you an example of how to fix it...

	search_room(str) {
	  if(str == "desk") {
	    write("You search the desk and find a tiny key.\n");
	    return 1; }
	  else {
	    write("You search the "+str+" but find nothing.\n");
	    return 1; }
	}

The 'desk' is the item that gives them something they'll need.
When they type something other than 'desk' they still get an
emote and it has to do with the item they search.  If you want
to see what is happening your way, go to your room8.c and 
'search rugs' and then 'search walls' and you'll get the exact
same emote.  This same problem holds true for each of the functions
of smell and listen too.

Next item:  You've done a nice job of taking care of item descs.
However, when you mention something else in the item desc, you
then need to do a desc for that new item.  Example: room6.c - I
look at the desk and see writing utencils.  But when I try to look
at the utensils, it says there aren't any.  Same thing in room8.c
with the banners and robes, etc.  So go through and look at every-
thing that you  mention and make sure they have descs for them.

<DONE>Room3.c - the desc says a hall leading 'west'.  Is that what you
really mean? -- meant east.. fixed!

<DONE>portal.c - when I read the tablet, typo (heared -> heard)-- FIXED!

<DONE>room8.c - I had a hard time understanding the plaque when I read it.
	You might want to see about some wording changes to make it
	more understandable.

<DONE>bchoice.c - Okay, how would a player ever know that the command to
	get out of this room is 'escape'.  I'm probably just not
	smart enough or I missed it.  If I didn't miss it, you need
	to put some kind of hint in.<= There is a hint when they look
                                       at the description =>

As I said, I think you're done a very nice job for your first try.
Understand that everyone had to go back and fix stuff so you are
not being singled out... besides, you asked me to look at it.
When you get the changes done, let me know and I'll revisit it if
you'd like.  I'll write to Snow and have  him check out the monsters
for legality too....			-Eurale
