[1m[34m~~~[0m[1mPike[0m[1m[34m@OfficerNet>> [0msee in my mind they can still have honor, we the coup happened in 03 it was because of a dissagreement on how the guild was being run, so even though we went gade we still operated with honor
[1m[34m~~~[0m[1mPike[0m[1m[34m@OfficerNet>> [0mi could go either way, the problem is that all of the guild weps and enhancement run on honor, i guess going gade is self expanitory, since it does say that some guild powers will not work as well, so maybe that is sufficient
