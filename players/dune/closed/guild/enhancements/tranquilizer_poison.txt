Tranquilizer Poison Cannon
Usage: tranq <monster>

     The arm-mounted tranquilizer poison cannon fires 1 to 10
Prozac darts which slowly course through the targeted monster's
circulatory system. Monsters that are aggressive in nature
become non-aggressive, for a short duration. The more darts -
the longer the monster is "tranquilized". When the poison 
finishes running its course, the monster will once again become 
aggressive, though this does not mean it will then immediately 
attack, for it may still be woozy. Higher quality implants 
increase the chance for more darts.
