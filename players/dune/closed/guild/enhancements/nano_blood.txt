Nano Blood

     Precious nano blood... all CyberNinjas ultimately strive
for this enhancement, but only the top echelon can have it.
This enhancement is only available to Directives and Executors.
Nano blood replaces the current blood flowing in your body.
It is sparkling silver in color, and teems with millions of
nanobots. These ultra-tiny robots can detect bodily transitions
and greatly increase their effectiveness.

     If polymer blood has already been installed, nano blood
does not completely replace it. Instead, nano blood adapts to
the polymers and uses them for combined advantage.
