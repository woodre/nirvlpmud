Mech Monitor
Usage: mechmon [info|beamin]

     The mech monitor is indeed a handy device for those ninjas
who buy mechs. It consists of a nyon luminescent display attached
to a micro-warp dimensioner. The nyon display connects to CyberDaemon
satellites that monitor the coordinates of your mech. Thus, you may
determine where your mech is, if you've lost it.

     The micro-warp dimensioner plots entry and exit sub-space
antithreads (which we all know to be wormholes). These dimensional
gates can be used to beam your mech to you.
