Sub-Dermal Armor

     CyberNinjas, due to their art of Ninjitsu and the sensitivity
of their CyberWare, are unable to make any effective use of armor.
What can be purchased, however, is sub-dermal armoring. This
specialized bio-integrated plastic is inserted under the skin in
critical positions and lessens damage taken from physical attacks.
