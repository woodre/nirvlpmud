Flux Generator
Usage: flux
       flux_set

     The Flux Generator is a portable neural energon body port
designed for close-range target termination. The generator is
extremely lightweight, and is installed into the body near the 
skeletal structure. Upon activation, it converts kinetics from
the CyberNinja's own power source into a blast of raw energy.
The type of blast can be manually changed at the user's
convenience with the 'flux_set' command. The default type of
blast is random, so that different types of rays may be emitted
each use. Neuralis PsiNet (TM) technology even allows the user
to perform mental-power attacks with Psi rays. Wow, that's cool!
