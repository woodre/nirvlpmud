Degenerative Poison Cannon
Usage: degen <monster>

     The arm-mounted degenerative poison cannon fires 1 to 10
Synthol-Biowaste darts which slowly course through a monster's
circulatory system, reducing or even eliminating its ability 
to regenerate. The more darts fired at the monster, the longer
the poison's duration will be. When the poison has run its
course, the monster may once again begin healing as it was.
Higher quality implants increase the chance for more darts.
