Vote Name : [termlimits-feb21_2003], a 21 day vote.
Vote Owner: Sleepwalker
This vote is Secret and the issue is:
     The Cyberninjas are blessed with a strong culture of combat, involvement and advocacy. The fulcrum of this is the sacred honor system. The guild is lead by the most experienced and honorable ninjas of all persectives and abilities. They are elected by a vote among all guildmembers and benefit everyone. However, their terms are indefinite. While Ninjas are able to help the guild more or less over time, the guild needs them just as much every day just the same. Myself and other wise and honorable CyberNinjas propose the following: Each elected office, Enforcer, Intellect, Executor and Directive shall have a term limit. At the end of the term a vote will open on behalf of the new position. The incumbent may run as may any other ninja who is recommended or feels qualified. Upon the honorable completion of their term, the incumbent may retire from office for a time or wait to run for another office. Other details will be worked out pending the result of this vote(term lengths etc). In the end it comes down to this: The CyberNinja Guild is healthy when the officer core is alive, fresh and strong. Term limits allow for new thinkers, fighters and strategists to vie for guild leadership. YES for term limits. CYBERNINJA! ~thanks~ theSLEEP
