messages "WOW(hugh):**I cant believe this board is empty.Now it is not.<3 Hugh**Mainhall post cleanup(hugh):**1)  Unmaxed cybers are to use their guild title.  Type set_title and then set_title # after deciding on a title.2) Crystalized Adrenaline is available green, 6w, 10n, open gate, say qtip, 3n.  If you do not have the coins on you, it will deduct from your credits if you have enough.3)  Added commands:  mwho - heat_wep - plant_mine4)Flux in PK works mud-wide, the damage type now uses that damage type, and stun now works in PK only in the guild hall.5)  Banned from cybers - Chett for gatm theft (1million credits)PSA:Post Pks on the PK board.We have an honor system:  Use it.Dont be another cyber's bitch.  Deal with the issue.  (dishonor\cry\mail officers)We have a voting system for Guild positions and guild issues.If you no longer have a guild position mail an officer if you need an explaination.Hugh**New laws (draft)(symbio):**Eye for an eye: (1) kid and pet killing is allowed if, and only if, someone attacks/kills your kid/pet first.  (2) Kill stealing is allowed if, and only if, someone steals your kill first.  And remember, revenge is a dish best served cold.PK: No quitting out of PK.New recruits: Newly recruited Cyberninjas may withdraw up to 100k from the guild atm.Guild Hall Defense: Defend the guild hall to the best of your ability, but be smart about it.  We are cunning warriors, not sacrifical lambs!  If you are clearly at a disadvantage, it is preferred that you set traps and fight mini-battles rather than stand your ground and die over and over.  Living to fight another day is sometimes the best choice.Guild enemies: Rangers, Knights and Knight allies are our enemies.  We do not align with them.  Always keep this in mind.Directive promotion: Directive is the only guild rank that can be established through a vote.  Executor, Enforcer and Intellect positions are appointed by a Directive.  Sensei positions are appointed by an Intellect. Directive abilities: the Directive holds supreme authority and power over the guild.  This includes the ability to veto guild laws and policies that have been passed by guild vote.  Vetoed guild laws and policies can still be enacted if a second vote (minimum 7 days) passes by a popular voting margin greater than 80%.  A Directive cannot veto another Cyberninjas bid for office.Directive activity:  A Directive must remain active (i.e., login at least once every 30 days) in order to rule.  Those who fail to do so will lose their position and that Directive's hiearchy will be dissolved.  However, in the event that a Directive loses his/her position, and there are no remaining Directives, the Executor will become acting Directive until the guild decides who the next Directive will be through the voting process (no less than a 7-day vote).  In the event the Executor is not active, the next highest rank (i.e. most honorable CyberNinja) on the guild ladder will become acting Directive.  Once a new Directive is appointed, they will create their own guild hiearchy.  Directive removal: a Directive can be removed from power through the voting process.  It requires at least an 80% popular vote, and the vote must be up for at least 7 days.  In the event the vote passes, the Directive's heirarchy will be dissolved.Vote creation: to create a vote you must be in the guild for at least 30 days, and have mastered our lethal ways (i.e. maxed belt and chip levels).what do y'all think?**new laws- my thoughts.(hugh):**I'm fine with most of the things up to the directive abilities.I think its kinda bullshit to decide 6 months from now that for example:You may now quit out of pk.I think the D "suspends" the law until a vote decides the matter.D election - I think its fine to make the D the only position of voting.  I couldsee something like a permanant\honory position of enforcer\intellect\sensei.I'd require that ninja to set a title saying honorary position.How is the 80% determined?  on the vote itself?  officers vs members?pk kills vs recruits.  :)Hugh**thoughts(symbio):**80% is just meant to be a majority thing.  I am a firm believer that the Directive has the supreme authority over the guild.  This is substantiated by 'cyber influence'.  I think Directive's should have the final say in everything.THAT BEING SAID,If the Directive vetos something that the entire guild likes, then that Directive runs the risk of being voted out.  BUT, with the traditional voting system a current Directive's vote counts for like 3 maxed Ninja votes (which isn't fair).  So I'm saying popular vote so that everyone's vote is equal.So the 80% thing isn't meant to be a dick move, it's mean't to give everyone an equal voice when it comes to choosing to remove a Directive.-Symb**gatm(sektor):**yea i mailed all officers on ladder thanks for postin**"
