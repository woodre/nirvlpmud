Operation File: renegade
Usage: cyber <topic>


     From time to time, a CyberNinja may lose desire to walk 
the confined yet glorious Path of Honor. This CyberNinja may 
choose to fall outside the gaze of its rules and rulers,
and become a Renegade... one who may break any and all rules 
of Honor. But this is not without its drawbacks... certain
guild powers as a Renegade become slightly less powerful.
A Renegade has chosen a path of conflict which will bring
about many battles.  One must be able and willing to fight
those battles.

     A Renegade can kill and be killed by honorable CyberNinjas. 
Thus, a duality exists within the guild, each being a 
check-and-balance against the other. It is possible for a group 
of Renegades to reek havoc with the current guild order, but not replace it 
and it is possible for those honorable and righteous to 
stamp out an intolerable band of derelicts. Yet, it is also
possible for both to co-exist peacefully and thereby prevent
each other's beliefs from being too extreme.

     It is possible for Renegades to have their own hierarchy
system. In other words, there could be a renegade leadership
that is not recognized by the CyberNinjas as a whole.

     To become a Renegade, use the 'renegade' command. Know that
once you become a Renegade, you cannot go back.
