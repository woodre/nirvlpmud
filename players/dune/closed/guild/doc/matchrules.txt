-- Combat is to the death.  Surrender is not allowed.
   If a player surrenders, the other ninja has the
   right to continue attacking the surrendering player.
-- Combatants MUST be in brave mode.  No whimpy.
-- No ninja shall purposely lose a fight in which that
   ninja would otherwise win.
-- The only objects allowed in combat are ninja weapons,
   and enhancements. Beatfixers are allowed.
-- Heals are NOT allowed. 
-- Ninjas must fight themselves. No participant may be
   given any help whatsoever.
-- Before and after combat, opponents should bow to
   eachother... an ancient CyberNinja custom.
-- A tournament overseer must be present and watching the
   match.  Without an overseer, a tournament match does
   not count.  Overseers will perform xp reimbursement
   and will record the victor and any disqualifications.
-- Overseers may disqualify any participant who disobeys
   the rules.
