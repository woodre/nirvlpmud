Room File: holodeck
Usage: cyber <topic>


     Holodeck is a special room for your entertainment.
It is a computer-controlled room where fantasy can become
reality.  Intangible thoughts can become material. It is
your private office or workroom.

     Holodeck is controlled by a central computer, so all
commands must be directed at the computer.  Use the 'say'
command, followed by 'computer, <command>'.  For example,
to terminate a program, type 'say computer, terminate program'.
Do not forget to include the comma and to 'save program' 
after every change you want kept.
