Introduction File: honor
Usage: cyber <topic>


     The Honor System is a stand-alone CyberNinja ranking
which is among the most important aspects of the guild.
Not based upon experience, it rewards those who help the
guild and penalizes those who damage it.

     Ninjas are rewarded honor by performing helpful
and honorable deeds in the guild's best interest.

     In addition to the deed awards given by CyberNinjas,
automatic checks are performed periodically to reward honorable
behavior and bestow dishonor on those acting against CyberNinja
interests.

     The following list describes the Honor System levels:

Legend     complete embracement of the WAY, what every ninja strives to be
Paragon    perfection of belief and morals, the true prophet
Uber       untouchable honor, one who defines right and wrong
Archon     supreme honor and unquestionable devotion
Savant     mastery of intellectual thought and practice
Cynosure   concentrated devotion, a guide for honorable deeds
Revered    established values and learned beliefs
Cognizant  awareness of guild values
Neophyte   the honor rating of all newbie ninjas
Lame       misguided priorities, ignorant of moral laws
Shamed     cyber trash, no respect for fellow ninjas

     Those with higher honor ratings receive benefits in
guild powers and commands. In the middle to lower ranges,
there may restrictions on achieving the top quality and 
belt levels. Those of worst honor suffer loss of significant 
guild commands.

   Warning: Use of the following commands is under the following
VERY strict guidelines (these guidelines must be followed just
as strictly as rules which deal with wizard-player relationships).
1) Use the honor or dishonor commands only ONCE for each significant
     achievement or transgression. If a ninja needs to be rewarded
     or penalized in an extreme manner, either use the highest
     range with which you can honor or contact a more senior
     guild member.
2) Keep the guild's best interest at heart. Do not use the
     commands for your own purpose.
3) Know that the commands are logged, and their use will be
     monitered.
4) Always honor more than dishonor. Don't be afraid to perform
     either action. If you have the power, you must use it!

   Guidelines on honoring/dishonoring:
1) Don't honor for minor everyday things, such as bowing.
2) Always use the lower to mid-range honor settings unless 
     the achievement is unusual.
3) The highest honor setting should never be used unless you
     really feel the achievement has 'hall of fame' status.
4) The average setting with which you honor/dishonor should
     be just under half of the range.

   There are six ranges (potencies) of honoring/dishonoring.
These change depending upon your influence. The following list 
describes the ranges:
small      used for minor actions which must go rewarded
medium     used for somewhat more significant actions
large      used for important actions
huge       used for huge impacting actions
monstrous  used only in special circumstances
godly      far and above all other ranges

     The 'honor' command allows you to honor or dishonor
     a guild member. Type 'honor' by itself to see your
     honor range. You must always specify a clear reason
     for performing this command.
