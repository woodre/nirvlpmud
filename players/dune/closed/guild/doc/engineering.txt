     Ninjas are knowledged in neural processors to such 
an extent as to be able to upgrade the chips of other 
ninjas. The services that all ninjas provide to each
other are crucial to the guild... without learning how
to upgrade another's chip, no ninja would be able to 
advance in guild level.

     To upgrade a ninja's processor, one needs to obtain
a chip die set from the CyberNinja Fabrication Facility
(see 'cyber map' to get there, and when there you can
type 'register' to obtain a list of commands). Then, 
the ninja must 'engineer' the die set to create the 
actual neural processor that is to be installed. 
Finally, the ninja will perform the actual installation, 
which is accomplished with the following commands:

___________________Engineer Abilities__________________
upgrade <member> <processor>
     The 'upgrade' command allows you to upgrade the
     quality of a ninja's chip. You must be of higher
     quality level than who you are upgrading...
     unless you are of highest quality chip.

upgrades <member>
     Shows you a list of upgrade options that the 
     specified member may choose from.
