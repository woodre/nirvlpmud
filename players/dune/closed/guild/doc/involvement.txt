     Every member is encouraged to enter guild politics.
The CyberNinja guild cannot and should not be run by wizzes.
For example, without the Sensei, nobody would be able to
train in their discipline (unless consulting the higher
guild orders).  Thus, guild members must voice their opinion
on any topics of concern.

     One of the main purposes of the CyberNinja guild
is to provide something more than just fighting and experience
point gaining. It is a world in and of itself, ruled by
players who should feel free to play any way they like.

     However, guild politics is not limited to resolving guild 
issues and correcting problems.  It means active involvement 
of members in all areas of interest.  Such areas can be tournament
directing/officiating, writing guild history, etc. After all,
this is your guild!  You have a chance to make it as wonderful 
as you want it to be. If you are interested in a guild office, 
make it known! It won't land in your lap if you don't express
any kind of interest.
