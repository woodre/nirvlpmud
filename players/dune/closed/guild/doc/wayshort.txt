     The Way of the CyberNinja is the code by which each ninja
lives by.  It is the basic law by which judgement and advancement
are based upon. And, it is up to the players themselves to
interpret it.

Respect:  All ninjas shall respect their fellow guild members, 
  even when in combat against eachother.  This can be displayed 
  as a bow and/or refraining from verbal/physical harrassment.

Skill at Arms:  All ninjas are expected to maintain their training
  so as to display proficiency and strength in combat.

Mental Confederation: All ninjas should strive their best to 
  be involved in the guild mentally. This means not just being a 
  member, but being actively involved in guild issues and 
  improvement.

Physical Confrontation:  An honorable ninja shall only fight
  another honorable ninja, in a sparring situation or if both
  ninjas verbally consent to do battle.
