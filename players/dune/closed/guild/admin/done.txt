>>>>>>> The following rules are in place:
arena.c is only to be used under closest supervision (and is only
accessable by a teleport from a wizard). If a player was pk before 
the fight, then the monitoring wiz must set that player's pk 
(probably by commanding the player to "kill_players").




>>>>>>> The following changes have been done:
>>>>>>> (text preceded with a * is something you suggested, for reference):

lib_advCmds/retreat.c   *cost of "peace" spells will be changed to about
                        100 sp for mass, 120 for specific
includes/enhancements.h changed sp cost of emt to above cost

lib_tools/emt.c         follows above suggestion for sp cost (mass)

remove lib_genCmds/transfer.c (renamed to xfer.c)

lib_genCmds/transfer.c  redone to follow /doc/build/RULES/teleports
lib_genCmds/xfer.c      same as above

lib_advCmds/shadows.c   follows costs of teleports, i.e. 55 sp
                        40 noncombat, 70 in combat

lib_advCmds/transto.c   *cost of 200 is fine 
                        this now follows the other requirements in 
                        /doc/build/RULES/teleports
                        (i.e. usage of obj/base_tele.c)
                        Both xfer.c and transto.c use obj/base_tele.c

daemons/combat.c        disallowed guild spells in pk, except for
                        p1, p2, and p3 (because these completely
                        replace missile, shock, and sonic...
                        for obvious thematic reasons).

lib_tools/overload.c    made sure that this does not affect players
lib_advCmds/lead.c      made sure it can not be used vs players

doc/cmds+short.txt      changed sp costs to reflect chgs in this file

rooms/teleport.c        removed mailroom location
object/cyber_mail.c     *no offense but isnt one mail system enough?
                        *i feel there is no need for more mem for mail
                        for now, i've just removed the room entrance to
                        get to the mail room that uses this mail object.

lib_tools/digest.c      *justification of cost for this power is needed
                        *otherwise this is illegal (in short: the cost is 
                        *not enough to merit this power at all)
				REDUCED heal_self from 2 to 1 (halved healing)

lib_tools/reg.c         there is now some random loss in transfer
lib_tools/rej.c         same as above

lib_advCmds/ncon.c      made the 100's into 10's- no exact numbers!

snow/weapons  wepmanager.c- dropped the multiple attack max to 3
              5 attacks per round every hb.
              *waaaay too much on cpu- in short lag producer
              *note: the weapons are still subject to scrunity
              *      as a very close examination is needed

snow/mechs/laser.c      took out set_heart_beat(1);

includes/mechs.h        increased mech costs (range is 8k to 60k)
mechs/mech.c   changed this to cover the changes made to
               /players/snow/closed/cyber/mech.c
               said changes:
                 set_heart_beat() call to be placed in
                 reset(arg) not in init()
                 in heartbeat take out the sp drain to
                 the attacker if the attacker is a player
snow/mechs     *the pricing of mechs of 2k to 20k is a bit low 
               changed to 8k to 60k
               also, made sure that set_heart_beat(1) is ONLY called 
               in the reset(arg) of the mech.c [laser.c for instance
               calls it again]
mechs          also, add_exp() in mech.c  - the amount handed over to
               the player is now a fraction, else the player could 
               have the pet attack and never lift a finger and get xp
               *suggestion of fraction would be 1/10 or 1/15
               fraction is 1/10
               made sure "kami" does not allow for mechs to smash into pets
               there is now an sp cost of the player as well when doing a "kami"
               mech_guard- made sure can not be used in combat with a pet
mechs          made sure that when stopping a mech in combat that the
               opponent does not completely stop the attack should
               it be attacking another- i.e. no free peace spells
