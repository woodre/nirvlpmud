     Intellects are in charge of expanding the guild's
influence on Nirvana, documenting guild history, and 
thinking of various innovations - whether they be
in the form of guild code modifications or role-playing
approaches. Their domain is player and political issues.
It is not necessary for Intellects to be PK.

     Intellects serve as knowledgeable advisors, and are
are capable of writing new guild lore in the Guild Archives
room.

dnet <message>
     Send a message through CyberDaemon. This will reach
     all ninjas whether they are muffled or not.
onet <message>
     Guild officer channel tell. Use this command exactly
     like 'net', your message goes to only guild officers.
onem <message>
     Guild officer channel emote. See also 'onet'.
recruit <player>
     Allows you to recruit a player into the guild.
     See 'cyber recruit' for more info.
recruits
     Allows you to see who you are currently counseling
     as well as your remaining recruit slots.
uncounsel <player>
     Allows you to uncounsel a player you have recruited.
     If you use this command to uncounsel a player who
     is already a member of the guild, then you will lose
     honor but your recruit slot will be freed up, so try to
     recruit players who might be successful in the guild.
     If you uncounsel a player who is not a member of the
     guild, there is no honor penalty.
