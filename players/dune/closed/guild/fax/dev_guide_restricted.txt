     The CyberNinja guild runs off of a fully daemonized
code structure. This means all code that glues together the
guild is centralized and generalized. Centralization means that
all daemons are stored in a central directory. Generalization
means that the components of the guild are independent from the
guild engine. This makes development of each guild component
trivial, because component code does not have to worry about
the more complex guild engine code.

     Guild directory structure is as follows:
COMMAND LIBRARIES
Command libraries store all guild commands. Each command has
its own ".c" file associated with it. And, each command file
is automatically located and loaded by the guild engine (more
specifically, the action daemon). So, to add a new command,
determine which library to add the command (depending upon which
seems a best fit) and then add the file to that directory.
  lib_genCmds/     general guild commands
  lib_advCmds/     advanced guild level commands
  lib_admCmds/     administrative guild commands
  lib_emotes/      guild emotes
  lib_tools/       enhancement commands

GUILD OBJECTS
These directories store miscellaneous guild components which
don't quite fit into another classification. But they are
central aspects nonetheless.
  snow/weapons/    guild weapons
  snow/mechs/      guild mechs
  objects/         various guild objects
  boards/          guild bulletin boards
  implants.c       guild object
  DEFS.h           guild paths and global variables
  COLOR.h          ascii color file

GUILD DOCUMENTS
Guild documents store all the help/log files of the guild.
Help/log files are simply text files, whose contents are 
displayed by various guild commands. Two special directories,
the 'fax' and 'docs' directories, have special formats for
help files which determine how the files are displayed: 
----files that end in 'menu.txt' or 'short.txt' are fully displayed
----all other files are displayed one page at a time
  logs/            stores guild logs
  docs/            general guild help files
  fax/             guild officer and guild wiz help files
  admin/           guild administrator help files
  enhancements/    enhancement help files

GUILD ENGINE
The guild engine is composed of the guild daemons (which are
a bunch of grouped utility functions) and include files.
There is a special format in order to use guild daemons and
include files (which allow access to guild settings/procedures):
----when using the include files (guild settings), 
    include the central DEFS.h file and then
    include the definition that corresponds to the include
    file that you wish to include.
----when using guild daemons, use a 'call_other' that
    specifies the name of the function within in the guild
    daemon to use.
  daemons/         guild engine code (guild daemons)
  includes/        guild settings

GUILD ROOMS
All guild rooms are placed in the rooms directory. Guild
rooms can access the guild daemons and settings freely.
