     Managers are those with full administrative commands,
and possibly read/write access to the guild. Thus, managers
are guild wizzes in the classic sense, and being a manager
can provide a nice hobby for long time wizards, or perhaps
as a learning experience for future guild owners.

     But because of the all-or-nothing status of managers,
there is much responsibility. Though ultimately the
responsibility falls into the guild owners' hands, managers
provide much of the life in guild administration.

     The following are some issues that managers should
somehow be involved in:
guild direction (future additions/modifications to code/theme)
guild operation (player problems/issues, guild wiz issues)
nirvana changes (guild modification according to new rules)

     The role of the manager is that of a member of the 
executive guild board. Major guild decisions should always
be made as a team on this board (not as a non-participant 
or ruthless dictator). With all this power, keep in mind that
the CyberNinja guild is really player run, and that it is
not in the best interest of the guild if wizzes are constantly
interfering with guild-play, or if players develop a 
dependency upon managers to tell them what to do and how
things should be.
