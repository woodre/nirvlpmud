Fax File: tier3
Usage: fax <topic>


     Tier3 wizards are those who are members of the guild,
but are not full "guild wizards" in the traditional sense
of the word. Tier3 wizards, called contributors, do exactly
that. They contribute to the guild by helping to think of
new ideas, resolving guild issues, handling player questions, 
or by just simply being a member.

     Contributors are not given administrative commands,
because that is not their role. Instead, contributors
enhance theme by being guiding entities (somewhat similar
to the classical mortal vs. immortal relationship in myths).
Contributors do this in either a development fashion or
player relations fashion.

     Just as there are different tiers of wizards, there
are different types of Tier3 wizards. Each type is devoted
to enhance role-playing and guild quality in the area
specified. This promotes organization within the guild
wizard system.
