Fax File: directive
Usage: fax <topic>


     A Directive is exactly that: one who directs others.
The guild is essentially managed by this office, as the
CyberNinja guild wizards have relinquished all involvement
to the Directive(s). There may be multiple Directives, 
but this should be limited to only a very few players at
most. A Directive must be an active player who can respond
to guild issues as they arise... or forfeit the office.

     Directives should have extensive PK experience so
that they may provide proper guild direction. However, it
is not necessary that Directives currently be PK.

     A Directive must ensure that, either by appointment
or popular vote, they have an entourage of lower officers 
to help deal with issues. These officers report to only
their Directive and not to another Directive (each Directive
must form their own entourage).

___________________Directive Abilities_________________
make_law <message>
     Make a new law that all Ninjas may view with the law command.
laws
     View the Directive laws.
dnet <message>
     Send a message through CyberDaemon. This will reach
     all ninjas whether they are muffled or not.
empower <member> <position> [grent/remove]
     The 'empower' command is the all powerful command
     that gives members guild offices or takes them away.
     'yes' means give the player the position, 
     'no'  means take the position away.
     Type 'empower' by itself for a list of types.
enhancements <who>
     By typing in a name of a guild member after the
     enhancements command, you may see their enhancements.
     You may see your own by normally just typing
     'enhancements'.
gbalance
     Allows you to see the credit account balances of all 
     currently logged on guild members.
nstats
     A special who command that shows detailed information
     about all online ninjas. This information includes
     current/max hit point and spell point totals, etc.
onet <message>
     Guild officer channel tell. Use this command exactly
     like 'net', your message goes to only guild officers.
onem <message>
     Guild officer channel emote. See also 'onet'.
recruit <player>
     Allows you to recruit a player into the guild.
     See 'cyber recruit' for more info.
recruits
     Allows you to see who you are currently counseling
     as well as your remaining recruit slots.
train <member>
     Allows you to train a fellow CyberNinja in the martial
     arts, thus allowing that ninja to advance in art level.
     The student ninja will need to have the required xp
     in order to be trained successfully.
uncounsel <player>
     Allows you to uncounsel a player you have recruited.
     If you use this command to uncounsel a player who
     is already a member of the guild, then you will lose
     honor but your recruit slot will be freed up, so try to
     recruit players who might be successful in the guild.
     If you uncounsel a player who is not a member of the
     guild, there is no honor penalty.
unrenegade <member> [commit]
     Without typing "commit", lets you see the Renegade
     status of a member. If you type "commit" after the
     name of the ninja (as specified in usage above), it
     removes the Renegade status from a Renegade ninja.
     That ninja will then again follow the path of honor.
     Honor is reset to that of a new guild member.
suspend/unsuspend <member>
     Allows you to suspend a member from the guild.
     Unsuspend removes suspension. Suspension will disable
     the member's guild object, but object will still
     remain on the player.
report <what>
     Allows you to report the winner of a match.
     Tournament name should be included.  Comments or
     disqualifications may be noted as well.
tourney
     This shows the contents of the tournament report file.
     All reports written will be shown.
