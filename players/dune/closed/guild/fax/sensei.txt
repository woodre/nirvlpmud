   The Sensei is one of the most senior members of the
guild. For only Senseis can provide training to black
belt ninjas. Furthermore, Senseis can award/punish in
higher amounts of honor.

   As a Sensei, you should not refuse training to ninjas
in need. Though ninjas who are not Senseis do not have 
this responsibility, Senseis are encouraged to delegate
non black belt training tasks to other lower level ninjas.

ens <who>
     By typing in a name of a guild member after the
     enhancements command, you may see their enhancements.
     You may see your own by normally just typing
     'enhancements'.
gbalance
     Allows you to see the credit account balances of all 
     currently logged on guild members.

     Allows you to recruit a player into the guild.
     See 'cyber recruit' for more info.
recruits
     Allows you to see who you are currently counseling
     as well as your remaining recruit slots.
train <member>
     Allows you to train a fellow CyberNinja in the martial
     arts, thus allowing that ninja to advance in art level.
     The student ninja will need to have the required xp
     in order to be trained successfully.
uncounsel <player>
     Allows you to uncounsel a player you have recruited.
     If you use this command to uncounsel a player who
     is already a member of the guild, then you will lose
     honor but your recruit slot will be freed up, so try to
     recruit players who might be successful in the guild.
     If you uncounsel a player who is not a member of the
     guild, there is no honor penalty.
