Vote Name : [activeladder-mar14_2015], a 14 day vote.
Vote Owner: Recca
This vote is Open and the issue is:
     This vote is to enact a new Law stating each ranked Cyberninja (those listed in the guild Ladder) must login at least once a month (a rolling 30 day period). Those who fail to do so will lose their position. A post on the guild boards can warrant an extended leave. If the law is passed, the initial 30 days will start from the Law's posting date.
