Vote Name : [shadowstone_for_intellect-jul21_2004], a 30 day vote.
Vote Owner: Doodle
This vote is Open and the issue is:
     Shadowstone isn't interested in being appointed into the position, so I created a vote for it.  If you would like to see him hold the office of Intellect, vote yea.  If you don't, vote nay.  *side note*  I will still be appointing all other officers for my entourage, Shadowstone stated he'd rather be voted in.
