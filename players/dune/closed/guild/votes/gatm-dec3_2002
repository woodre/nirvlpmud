Vote Name : [gatm-dec3_2002], a 14 day vote.
Vote Owner: Shadowstorm
This vote is Secret and the issue is:
     Since many CyberNinjas forget to hand gifts to the new joiners, i would like the new joiner to be able to withdraw up to 60k credit from our ATM. This withdraw is not to be paid back, since it's a welcoming gift. And giving away small personal gift will be welcomed of course. You can vote by (Yea/Nay) Yea: Yes i would like to see the new joiners able to withdraw 60k credit(if availble) from ATM which they will not be required to deposit again. Nay: No, i don't think this will be a good idea...(Yea/Nay)
