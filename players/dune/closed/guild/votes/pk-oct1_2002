Vote Name : [pk-oct1_2002], a 10 day vote.
Vote Owner: Hugh
This vote is Open and the issue is:
     One of the first rules about player killing that i'd like to create. 
Which is: don't pk without heals. To many cybers join in pk fights without
heals thinking that won't need them since they are not tanking.  Wrong, pk
isn't like killing npc mobs a player can change their target and attack the
weakest link in the chain.So i propose that if you want to join a pk fight
you must have at least 2 sets of heals, meaning at least 600 hp and sp
healing power. Pking on your own is different since you only rely on
yourself and the outcome is quite obvious when you are not prepared.
Dishonor should be a large since you let those you were going to help down.
