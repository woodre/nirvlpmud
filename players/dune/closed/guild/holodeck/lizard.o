long_desc "The flickering light of several dozen white taper candles, their flamesteased by a warm, lazy breeze, along with the hushed dulcet tones ofnew age music, welcome you to Lizard's nest.  As your eyes adjust to theshadowy dusk, you see that you are flanked by tall oak bookcases filledwith ancient tomes smelling slightly of dust and rising to the ornately carved ceiling on three of the five sides of the room.  A fourthwall is dominated by an enormous stone fireplace, sporting a merrily cracklingfire which fills the room with a slightly smoky but fragrant scent, surroundedby a cozy rounded alcove which is set two steps below the rest of the roomand is filled with an inviting array of overstuffed pillows and brightlystitched quilts.  On the fifth wall of the pentagonal room sits a statelyfour-poster bed fashioned from dark cherry, pristine with its fluffy whitecoverlet and translucent white canopy which flutters softly in a silentcaress of the dark cherry spires beneath it.  Beside the bed rests a largecherry cabinet, its hinged doors securely closed as if hiding all mannerof secrets.  As you step inside this haven, you feel at peace."
