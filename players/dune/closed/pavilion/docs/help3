---===ROBOMECH HELP3===---

     Now Stilgar and Liet, who are the pilots of
Yonex and Estusa, respectively, are ready to
fight.  They both type 'walk up'.  This takes
them to RoboMech Battlefield.  Stilgar and Liet
end up in totally different spots (determined
randomly).  They both immediately type:
'comm I am going to kill you' and then
'mechs'.  They both look at which zone the
other is in, and proceed to target eachother.
Stilgar targets Liet by typing 'target liet',
and vice versa for Liet.  They then guess what
direction to aim, and aim that according
direction.  Stilgar types 'aim se' and Liet
types 's'.  Stilgar then fires his PPC by typing
'fire ppc'.  Liet fires his LRM by typing
'fire lrm'.  Stilgar hits and Liet misses.
Both pilots (Stilgar and Liet) continue these
same actions for a few rounds, and eventually
Liet's mech explodes into a million pieces.
