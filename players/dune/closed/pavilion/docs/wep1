---===ROBOMECH WEP1===---

     There are several types of weapons available
to your RoboMech.  Type 'robo wepinfo' for detailed
information about each weapon.  The 'punch' weapon
is your default weapon, you can always punch.
     Weapons have range, heat dissipation, range, 
blast radius, ammunition requirement, destruction
factor, and capacity.  
     Weapons with a range greater than zero will 
shoot off a 'bullet' in the direction your mech is 
currently facing.  Weapons have their own targeting 
systems, so if you have specified a target, the bullet 
will hit its target... if the target is in the path 
of fire.  Path of fire is the direction that you 
are aiming.  Path of fire is defined as a straight
line that continues until it runs into a battlefield 
wall.  Bullets will follow this path of fire if your
aim of fire is specified.  If you have not specified
an aim, or have specified an aim of 'any', your
path of fire follow a straight randomly determined
path.
