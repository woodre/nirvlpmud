---===ROBOMECH PURPOSE===---

     The main purpose of RoboMech is clear
and simple: to have fun.  RoboMech also has
a secondary purpose: to provide an alternative
to player-killing.  
     RoboMech is totally free; it costs no
spell points, experience points, coins,
hit points, etc.  The only thing you gain
or lose is standing upon the RoboMech
Champion listing, in the RoboMech Hangar.
     RoboMech's theme is not to imitate
BattleTech or RoboTech.  It is to use these
winning ideas in a way to promote fun and
realism.
