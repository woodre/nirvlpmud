---===ROBOMECH MECH2===---

     Heat loss is the efficiency at which your
RoboMech is able to dissipate heat.  Smaller mechs
can tolerate more heat than larger mechs.  Heat
is caused by weapon fire.  Heat is reduced gradually
by time.  Heat can also be reduced by self-repair.
Too much heat causes system shutdown.  This is
overheating.  If you overheat, you must wait while
your mech cools down, meanwhile you are a sitting
duck.
     Capacity of mech signifies the size of your
mech.  Larger mechs can carry more weapons/ammo,
and thus have more capacity.  Capacity cannot
be reduced, so think about what you want in your
mech before you go loading it up.
