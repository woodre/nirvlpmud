---===ROBOMECH WEP2===---

     Weapon blast radius is the number of rooms
a target (if hit) will be blasted through upon
impact with bullet.  Blast radius direction is
randomly determined, since bullets may hit at
any angle... causing different impact result
directions.  
     Every weapon dissipates some amount of
heat upon weapon fire (punches do not dissipate heat,
however).  This heat may accumulate after continued
weapon fire, which may result in overheating.
Overheating is the inability of the RoboMech to
cool itself.  Upon an overheat, the RoboMech will
shut down.  All systems will de-activate, except
your ability to 'bail' out of the cockpit.
During system shutdown, your mech will attempt to
cool itself down.  However, you will be unable to
attack and thus be vulnerable to enemy fire.
After your systems cool down enough, your mech
will re-activate and you may continue combat as
normal.
