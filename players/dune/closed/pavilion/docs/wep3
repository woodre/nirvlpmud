---===ROBOMECH WEP3===---

     Destruction factor is the amount of damage
the weapon causes.  Weapon damage reduces mech
armor (hit points).  
     Weapons require ammunition.  If your mech
runs out of ammunition, you'll have to use the
'punch' weapon.  Ammunition cannot be replaced, 
so keep track of it, and don't waste.
     Weapons also have capacity, which is the
amount of room your weapon takes up.  Ammo
also takes capactiy, so reserve enough room for
ammo too.  Once you have filled up on capacity, 
there is no way to reduce it.  So keep track.
     Powering up weapons is the method of
installing the same type of weapon more than
once.  A weapons power can be easily doubled
or tripled, etc. this way.  However, heat loss
is also multiplied.  Powering up weapons can
be an easy way to overheat quick.
