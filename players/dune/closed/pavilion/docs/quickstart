---===ROBOMECH QUICKSTART===---

      The very first thing you should do is to make a RoboMech.
At the Hangar, type: 'assemble <name> <type of mech>'.
Then you must install weapons and ammo, so find the weapons you
want with the command 'robo wepinfo' and 'robo ammoinfo' to
choose.  Now type: 'install <weapon>' and 'supply <weapon>'
until you have filled your mech with weapons.  Type 'sys' to
see your current mech status.
     When ready to fight, type: 'walk up'.  You will be placed
somewhere on the battlefield.  Type: 'mechs' to see the location
of other mechs.  When ready, 'aim <direction>', 'target <mech>' or
'target any' if you are not sure which mech you want to kill.
Then fire away by typing: 'fire <weapon>'.  If you want to punch
a mech, type: 'punch <mech>'.  For any more information, 
type 'robo' for the list of topics, then 'robo <topic>' for help
on a specific topic.
