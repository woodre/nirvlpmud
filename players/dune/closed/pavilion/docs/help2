---===ROBOMECH HELP2===---

So now Stilgar and Liet are all happy in their mechs.
But, before they go off and fight, it might be
a good idea to install some weapons.
Stilgar types: 'install ppc'.  Thus, Stilgar's mech
Yonex now has a Plasma Projection Cannon.  But,
no ammo.  Stilgar now types 'supply ppc'.  He now
has some ammo for his PPC.  Stilgar repeats this
a few times because he likes PPC's.  Finally,
Stilgar runs out of capacity.  His mech is all
full.  He knows this because he can't install
or supply any more PPC's and when he types
'systems' and 'robo weapons', he sees that he
does not have enough capacity for another
PPC.  Liet, like Stilgar, has a particular liking
to one particular weapon... the LRM.  Liet
installs and supplies all the LRM's he can.
