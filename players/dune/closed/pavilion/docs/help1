---===ROBOMECH HELP1===---

     To help you get started, here's an example.
Let's say we have a player named Stilgar who wants
to play RoboMech with a player named Liet.
Stilgar and Liet both go to RoboMech Central and
read all the documents.  They then go to the
RoboMech Hangar and register.  They look at the
Champs of RoboMech and marvel.  They say, "Wow,
I want to be on that very list!".  Thus, they
assemble their mechs.  Stilgar doesn't exaclty know
what kind of mech he wants, so he types:
'assemble yonex medium'.  He has created a medium
mech named Yonex.  Stilgar is now inside his RoboMech.
Liet types 'assemble estusa lancer'.  Liet has
thus made a lancer mech named Estusa.
