---===ROBOMECH MOVEMENT===---

     Movement in RoboMechs is similar to
movement as a player.  The normal 
north, east, south, west, northeast,
southeast, northwest, and southwest
commands can be used as usual.
The normal shortcuts n, e, s, w, ne, nw,
se, and sw can also be used as usual.
     However, when moving to a room
with an exit other than the above, you 
must type 'walk <direction>', where
direction is the exit direction you wish
to go.  Example: 'walk up' to walk
up, 'walk hangar' to leave in the
'hangar' exit.
     Note: mech movement operates on a
delay according to your RoboMech's speed.
Lancer mechs move faster and Full mechs
are relatively slow.
