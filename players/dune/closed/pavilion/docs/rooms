---===ROBOMECH ROOMS===---

     RoboMech Central:  This is the very
first RoboMech room you encounter after
entering the RoboMech Pavilion complex.
RoboMech Central holds all the RoboMech
help files.  
     RoboMech Hangar:  This room is where
you assemble, install/supply weapons,
and look at the Champs list.  The Hangar
is also where you may access the RoboMech
Battlefield.
     RoboMech Battlefield:  The RoboMech
Battlefield is X-shaped.  It is divided into
five different zones.  Each has its own
color.  Throughout the RoboMech Battlefield, 
you will hear the sound of weapon fire and 
mech fighting.  All Battlefield rooms access 
the Hangar.  Type 'robo map' to see a diagram
of the battlefield map.
