---===ROBOMECH WIRED===---

     While you are in your RoboMech, you will
be fully wired as to what is going on around
you.  Your main communication tool is the
RoboMech channel.  You may talk through it,
usage 'comm <message>', and you may hear other
messages/announcements through it.  You 
cannot muffle this channel.  You wouldn't need
to anyway.  You may also use the RoboMech
channel to get info about the whereabouts of
other mechs by typing 'mechs'.
     The RoboMech Battlefield also serves as
an information server.  You will be able to 
hear weapon fire and fight sounds from anywhere
on the battlefield.  After all, RoboMech fighting
is loud.
     Note: the say and look command can be used
 as normal.  However, the look command is used
as if you yourself were in the room and
not inside your mech.
