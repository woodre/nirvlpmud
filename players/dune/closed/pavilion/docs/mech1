---===ROBOMECH REPAIR===---

     You may repair your RoboMech by typing
'repair [minor/average/major]'.  This will
divert all systems into self-repair mode.
The only action available to you will be
to 'bail' out of your cockpit.  
     While in repair, your mech repairs
damage to armor and attempts to cool down.
The difference between minor/average/major
repairs is the time spent in repairing damage.
Minor repairs stall you by 5 time units.
Average repairs stall you by 10 time units.
Major repairs stall you by 15 time units.
     Be warned, while you repair damage,
you are vulnerable to attack.  If another
mech finds you while you are in repair, you
are a sitting duck.
