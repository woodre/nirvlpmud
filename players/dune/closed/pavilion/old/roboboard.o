tmp_text "All the information you'll need to know is eitherin the entry hall or will be availableonce you are inside your RoboMech.Please feel free to use this board for anycomments, suggestions, battle stories,or whatever.**blasting kinda sux,'cause your looking for someone, they blast you and run thats strategic, but unfair**I thynk blastyng is cool. If someone cuts loose on wyth a byg gun, it's nyce to know they have to fyndyou agayn before they can keep blastyng.**Last one to bail...**Hello :)   Just want to get some input on what youguys think of the battlefield setup.  And, do youthink that it is too hard to kill someone?  too easy?Let me know, and we'll make robomech better and better.**What does the speed ratyng under the mechs mean?I haven't notyced much dyfference between them at all.Also, I thynk the mechs seem to be a lyttle too hardto blow up. In order to get on the champs lyst, youhave to make a kyll, but wyth the toughness that hygh,they're near impossyble to destroy wythout thepylot baylyng fyrst.One more thyng, I thynk you should be able to use'comm' whyle your mech is coolyng down. Just a fewsuggestyons.**Ok, I've made some changes so that it is now easier to killeachother.  That way you can get on the champs list :)1) Guns do more damage2) Guns use less heat3) Guns have more ammo4) Mechs have lower armorThat should do it.  I've actually doubled theamount of ammo you get, so you should be able to shootaway, with less worry.... but when it runs out, it runs out.**me think this whole area is bs and should be rm'ed cause no one ever is in here.now if this could fix the lag then leave it.**help terminalqqqq ~Qq ~q**reopen this area!!!!**MAKE ROBOMECHS WORK!!!  It's no fun not being able toshoot.  All you can do is overheat your gun and wasteammo.  Punching is cool but you'll never kill anythingthat way.  FIX IT!!!  PLEASE!!!**blah**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
