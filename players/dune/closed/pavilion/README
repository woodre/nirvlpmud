README
     RoboMech is a multiple-room player interaction game.
Basically, players get inside mechs and fight eachother.
The winner is the player who destroys the other player's
mech.  All battle takes place upon a 28 room battlefield.
Mechs are able to move around and fire long range weapons
at eachother.
     Core files:  The files listed below are the vital
files of RoboMech.  All other files are either plain old
room files, help files, or basically unimportant.
All files below have the assumed /players/dune/pavilion/
directory left off.
mech.c              the actual RoboMech
living.c            edited living.c so mechs work
cockpit.c           object that allows control of the mech
control.c           daemon (slave object) for the cockpit.c
tracer.c            actual bullet that gets fired from mech
rooms/roboshop.c    room where the mech is created

cockpit.c/control.c are the crucial files in RoboMech and
contain all the basic functions.  cockpit.c gets cloned up
and moved inside mech.c upon creation of a mech.  This 
cockpit.c object does all the add_actions.

mech.c and tracer.c are both monsters.  They are the
RoboMech and bullet, respectively.

roboshop.c sets all mech variables.  RoboMechs are 
assembled here, with all variables 'burned' into the mech.

living.c is the edited living.c file that allows proper
mech movement and blast radius.
