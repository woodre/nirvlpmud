messages "RoboMech Under Construction(dune):**RoboMech is soon to get a major fixin!Thanks to all you pilots out there who'vestuck with RoboMech. You ain't seen nothingyet!Dune(PS RoboMech temporarily closed)**Current Status(dune):**RoboMech fixes and rennovations are going very well.The basic system is fixed at this point. I'll probably beperforming tests and adding enhancements at this point in time.I'm thinking of adding the following:  - land mines  - area affect weapons  - piercing weapons (goes through multiple mechs)  - navigation system (allows you to see all mechs via visual grid)RoboMech will probably re-open after basic rennovation.Dune**ROCK ON!(soundgarden):**Dune, you rock...I can't wait for the mechs to be fully operational.  Keep up the good work!**"
