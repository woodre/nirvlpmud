| THE LOST CITIES QUEST   |
|_________________________|

Recommended for players around the levels of 13 to 17.
Much more mentally challenging than physically.

General Overview and Purpose:
     The Lost Cities quest is a time-consuming quest where the
adventurers must find all six of the Lost Cities and there must
recover the Lost Sithi Stones.  Only then will they rescue the souls
of the Sithi.

Motives:
     The Lost Cities Quest has the strong underlying theme of 
patience and listening.  It is not possible for the adventurer
to finish the quest in less than 12 days (assuming no cheating).
This is because each city that must be found only appears every 
certain amount of moon phase shifts.  Only one city exists at any 
one time.  Every phase in moon lasts about 4 hours in duration.
     In addition, the players must talk with NPC's and learn what
they must do.  They must search the entire world throughout, and
learn the moon phases and city 'hot spots'.

Solution:
     The actual steps to solving the quest are as follows.
Order is not entirely important, as long as the diagram is
done last.  Note, all files listed will be under the directory:
/players/dune/closed/castle/rooms    if indicated with a CR
/players/dune/closed/castle/objects  if indicated with a CO
/players/dune/closed/castle/monsters if indicated with a CM
/players/dune/room                   if indicated with an ER
/players/dune/objects                if indicated with an EO
/players/dune/armor                  if indicated with an EA
/players/dune/monsters               if indicated with an EM
/players/dune/weapons                if indicated with an EW

1) Find Amerasu (located at CR/shrine.c), start asking her questions.
   She'll ask for help.  So say/tell/emote/whatever something with
   the word 'help' in it. She'll explain the required tasks
   to be done. Specifically that the cities and stones need to
   be found. She mentions that they should find the Moonshrine and
   to talk to Doctor Morgenes.

2) The players explore the land for Doctor Morgenes.  He is located
   in the Elemental Tower (room ER/doctor.c).  There they must say/
   tell/whatever something with the word 'moonstone' in it.  The doctor
   then gives them the moonstone (only once per reset).  With the
   moonstone, the players are able to leave the Sithi Cities because they
   can enter them but not leave.  All rooms are no teleport, so the
   moonstone is the only way to leave.  Also, the moonstone only
   works for rooms in my directories.  The moonstone teleports the
   players to a random room situated in a circular path about the
   moonshrine.

3) The players must go to the Moonshrine (at CR/green11.c).  There they
   will learn what phase of moon it is.  Then they should explore and
   try to find the cities.  Because the moonshrine randomly picks from 12
   places upon where to put a city, the players must search the land.
   When they find it, they'll enter the city and search for the stone.
   Each city has a Sithi Lord.  They must kill this lord in order to 
   get the stone the lord carries.

     Zaeymiritha       Noiar               CR/kementari/kementari13.c

4) If the moon has not changed phase, the players may continue to
   explore and get familiar with the area or find Ebudee, the wytch lady
   that lives in the swamp. Doctor Morgenes mentions Ebudee when the
   players obtain the moonstone from him.
   If the moon has changed phase, the player may search for another city.

5) It is not necessary to meet Ebudee (located at CR/tempent.c), but she
   gives further hints about how the Sithi cities appear. She also mentions
   how often Shaosaye, the last Sithi city, shows up. There is no stone
   in Shaosaye, but the players must go there when they have all the
   seven Sithi stones.

6) Now the players must go to Amerasu and say/tell/whatever the
   word 'diagram' in it. Amerasu mentions that they must do this when
   they first start the quest. She also mentions that when they have
   all the stones, they must ask her to sing the word 'jingizu', which
   causes Amerasu to walk towards the city of Shaosaye. The player
   must follow Amerasu unless he/she already knows where the city is.

7) Shaosaye, the last Sithi city, appears on all phases of the moon
   except that of a Dark moon. And, this city is different from the
   other cities in that it always appears in the same place.
   The Diagram is in Shaosaye, and the players must have all the
   seven Sithi stones to enter the Diagram. The point of the Diagram
   is that the players must use all the Stones to unlock it, and only
   then may they fight the end monster and collect quest points.
   To unlock the Diagram, the player must 'place' each Sithi Stone in the
   following manner:
   place zaeymiritha upon mirth glyph
   place yasira upon beauty glyph
   place shisaeron upon summer glyph
   place sesuadra upon farewell glyph
   place mayesa upon cat glyph
   place resurieni upon tranquility glyph
   place minneyar upon universe glyph
   place hand upon imprint
   The player will receive an orb (CO/questcheck.c) which stores
   quest info and allows for quest points to be added, but doesn't
   do the actual quest point adding.  A room (CR/end.c) does that.
   The player will then be teleported to a room where that player
   must fight Demosater one on one.  If the player wins, then that
   player may leave the room.  Upon leaving the room, and only upon
   leaving the room, the player receives quest points.
   The player is then deposited in a place where he/she may reach
   the village church.


Special Note:  Mezutua, the Sithi City of Fire, has a sort of mini-quest
               inside of it.  Players must find and gather the four
               orbs in order to reach the Sithi Lord and some treasure.
               (lord is at CR/firelord.c, treasure is in CR/archive.c)
               The treasure is a firesword (CO/firesword.c) and a suit
               of armor (CO/armageddon.c).  The orbs must be named
               their real names in order to unlock the door which 
               blocks access to the treasure and Sithi Lord.  The orbs
               must be named in the following manner:
               name steel orb katana
               name blood orb heart
               name black orb spider
               name glass orb mirror
               The names will be hinted to on the riddles inside the orb
               rooms.  When the players reach the door, they must drop all
               the orbs on the ground and 'position sphere into claw'
               The door opens and they may get through.

Workings of the Moonshrine:
     The Moonshrine works on the ctime clock cycle. It finds the number
of seconds that have passed, in the current year, working on a special
Lothlorien calendar (like ours but simplified, 30 days per month, 12
months). It then calculates the month, which it divides into 10 different 
moon sections. Every section causes a moon to shift in phase.  This causes 
the shrine to clone a city object which goes randomly to 1 in 12 different 
rooms. Any old city objects are destructed. The new city object remains in
the room it was sent to until the next moon phase.
Months change every 12 hours, phases change every other hour.
Months are (in order from left to right):
Jonever, Feyever, Marris, Avrel, Maia, Yuven, Tiyagar, 
Anitul, Septander, Octander, Novander, Decander
Random room directions are:
tempent.c, bush.c, 2east.c, 1sw2.c, brown2.c, brown4.c, brown8.c, 
brown1.c, hill4.c, hill5.c, hill9.c, outdoor2.c

All maps use the normal N, E, S, W compass as show on the below map.
M stands for moon phase dependent.  (only appearing certain moon phases).
H stands for hidden.

phase by the moon shrine
