   As you enter this magnificent room, you are awe struck by the sheer 
richness of your surroundings. The majority of the room is taken by the 
huge waterbed, which, apparently, is intended for more than two people. 
Looking to your left, you see a whirlpool, its motor quietly turning and
gently waves flowing along the surface of the water. To your right, a 
pair of solid glass french doors open to a spacious balcony, with a view 
of the town, and in the distance the many lands and castles of Nirvana. 
And, of course, in front of you is the bed, with a huge aquarium acting 
as a headrest, and little tropical fish swimming around, to create a 
somewhat 'wet' environment. To the left of the bed, you notice, is a 
tall wooden cabinet. Since you know Seductress, you decide you'd rather 
not look in there.
