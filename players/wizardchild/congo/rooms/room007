A short waterfall
**
  The forest parts slightly here to reveal a short, rocky waterfall and a
narrow creek flowing from its base. The rocks here are all wet and overgrown
with moss due to the extreme moisture, and lush plantlife hangs over from the
high trees. A warm mist blows by from the direction of the waterfall, making
your clothes even more wet than they already were. In the distance you can
hear birds singing, but you cannot tell where they are.
