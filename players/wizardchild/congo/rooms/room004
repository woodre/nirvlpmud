A small stream
**
  As if from nowhere, a small stream flows from somewhere in the forest, then
across the 'trail', and back into the forest. The water looks muddy and dark,
and although your thirst is great, your conscience is stronger. The water makes
the ground around it damp, and the footprints of large creatures that you'd
rather not know existed can be seen near the stream. Apparently, they crossed
the path here.
