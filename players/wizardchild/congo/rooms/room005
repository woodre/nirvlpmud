A small pool of water
**
  Here, a small pool of water collects. You cannot see where exactly it comes
from, just that it is here. There seems to be no current in it, although you
can see some motion under the surface. Around you the forest is dim and 
uninviting, and a overgrown form of moss hangs down from the trees. As you
walk it comes through your hair, leaving you with the small corpses of exotic
insects.
