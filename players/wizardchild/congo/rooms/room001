A small clearing
**
  You have entered a small 'clearing' of sorts. Around you, the trees are less
dense, and a form of grass covers the ground. In this area, the sun is allowed
to beat upon the earth, making it drier than the rest of the rainforest.
Walking around, you notice the tracks of animals, made shortly after a rainy
period, and hardened by the flaring sun. For some strange reason, you feel as
if you are being watched from the rainforest.
