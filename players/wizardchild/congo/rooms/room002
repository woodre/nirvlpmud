Deep inside the Congo
**
  As you enter this area, your eyes strain to focus. Around you, the trees are
taller and more dense than in any other area of the Congo. Only a few precious
rays of sunlight enter here, making little distinction possible. A muffled
rustling in the overgrowth reminds you that you are not alone, although you 
cannot tell its direction nor its creator. The ground here is damper than any
other place you have been, and your feet sink into the mud, tangling on the
twisted tree roots.
