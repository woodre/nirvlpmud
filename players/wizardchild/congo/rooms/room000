Entrance to the Congo
**
  You are standing at the end of a 'trail'. From here, there is nothing but over
grown rainforest, unexplored and untouched except by its few inhabitants. In eve
ry direction except the way you came lies nothing but lush, green  vegitation, a
nd enormous trees of unknown type, which block most of the sun. The ground under
your feet is soft, either due to recent rain or a lack of sun. The combination 
of humidity and heat makes breathing near impossible, and makes you lightheaded.
