Somewhere in the Congo
**
  Here, the land slopes gradually, making the tree tops uneven and allowing
more light to enter. The ground lacks the typical mushiness of other parts of
the Congo, and the plants seem slightly greener and even more overgrown, thanks
to the extra sunlight. Through the rays of sunlight, you can see birds flying
through the air. Compared to the rest of the Congo, this area is very relaxing.
