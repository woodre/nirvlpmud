Falling faster in my car; falling farther from just who we are; smoke a cigarette and lie some more, these conversations kill; falling faster in my..car. Time to take her home, her dizzy head is concious laiden; time to take a ride, it leaves 
today, no conversation; time to take her home, her dizzy head is concious laiden; time to wait to long, to wait to long, to wait to long. Conversation kills.
