This directory contains various library functions that I use sometimes.
If you want to use any of these functions, just #include lib.h into your code,
and use it like you had written the function in your own code. Please don't
inherit these modules, since they aren't set up for it. The lib.h file should
support everything in this dir. If you want to add a function into this lib, 
then please let me know.
