outside "A massive log cabin, surrounded by trees and shrubs. A large sign hangs above the doorway; it says "Welcome, logger". It is evident, however, that you need an invitation to enter this place."
cabin_long "As you enter this cabin, you are awestruck by its massive size. Looking around, you see the outer walls are made of trees 3 feet in diameter. This cabin has been equipped with all the amenities, including a large bed and a cast-iron stove. It evidentally belongs to Wizardchild."
