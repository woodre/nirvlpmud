   A small, cluttered valley. Off in the distance, a nuclear power plant pours
out steam. Apparently, someone hasn't been managing the plant very well, since
many mutated animals and people seem to be walking around.
   There is also a marble factory - ACME, of course - which appears to have a 
wealth of rocket scientists and just generally sensible guys. The path through
"town" (if you can call it that) seems to run out from the valley.
To enter this realm, go w,w,w,w,n,n,n,n,n,w.
