                       Monster Level List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This list is provided to give new wizards suggested guidelines on what
level to give the monsters they code.  Naturally, the levels for each
monster on this list do not need to be strict...A really big wolf could
be level 16, a pirate with a bit of gout could be level 7, etc.  See
monster_rules.txt for the appropriate stats that accompany each level.
