The note is titled 'New Guild command structure. (Jarana, Sun Sep 11 00:12:24 2005)':

It has become very clear that the Knights as a whole
have become a very weak, very fractured guild.  The 
dictatorship that Larisa has brought to the guild
maybe welcome by some but by most of us is just
a player with an ego trip gone wild.  The knights
for years have been free of her iron fist and 
now she decides that she should once again grace
us with her presence and she has started the guild
members whining and complaining again.  Have we all
forgotten how horrible a guild commander she was 
the first time around that we will let her have a
second crack at ruining this guild once again.  I
for one haven't and urge you to stop her misguided 
ways before she ruins the guild for everyone once
again.

Jarana - Still the Elite General no Matter what the current Administration says.
