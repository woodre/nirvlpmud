I feel Jarana has good points.  Also, my interpretation of what is on
the tablet may differ from another knights.  So who is correct and
who is maybe not so correct?  I'm a big boy and feel I can determine that
for myself.  I don't believe its so much as people don't respect the
tablet, they just don't want big brother looking down on them and
slapping their hand every time big brother feels the individual has acted
inappropriately.  We've tried this path before with GCs and all the
sort and it didn't work.  I know you can't constantly look backwards or
you'll run right into the wall, in the same regard if you don't learn
from the past you're doomed to repeat it.  Guess we are going to wash,
rinse and repeat.  That is all.

Can we keep messages to less than 300 lines?  I get bored after about the first 15. :)
