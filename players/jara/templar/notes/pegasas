Elite Knights will no longer report to the current Gc's of this guild. 
If you disagree with this...tough shit.
I will not follow Gc's who don't even fight or defend the guild.
You don't like it...then kick me out.
Elite are not going to put up with wimpy, simpering Gc's 
who can't even fight thier way out of a wet paper bag.

Who the hell made Larisa a guild commander? 
I don't think she has even geared up in like....
regen 25 decade.  Someone needs to seriously rethink the direction
they are taking this guild...or maybe you are just fucking hard-up.
I refuse to play a guild that makes someone who is as lame as
Larisa a guild GC.  I quit this guild when they let Symbio join...
This is almost worse.
