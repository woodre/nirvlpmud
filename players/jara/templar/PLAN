   
This is the current plan for the changes I'm planning to do for the
Knights Templar guild.
 
  1. Update room descriptions in guild hall.
  2. Conform all descriptions to approximately 70 spaces, but not to
  exceed 70.
  3. Modify the layout of the castle.
  4. Update the War Room and have the castle defenses in proper 
  working order.
  5. Update and add to the 'info' files.
  6. Create and implement quests for Knights.
  7. Modify current boards to allow removal of own notes.
 
I'm currently working on 1, 2, 3, 6.
