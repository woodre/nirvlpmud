Just a basic overview of this area, and progress reports. I've got the 
rooms mapped out, but I am still working on the theme. I'll try to work
on writing up the storyline and adding it here when it's completed. Btw,
Feldegast, if I am missing any subdirectories or if I should change the 
current ones, let me know before I get too much coded in here. ;)

<4/28/00> Notes: AM, created first room! It's a rough copy and I will likely
change the description once I look over it a bit more. Poke around in the 
code if you have time and let me know if it's acceptable. I'll possibly add
more to this specific room, in case you were wondering that, also, but I am
running a bit late at the moment as it is.. :) 
File: /players/jara/area1/docks/room/wrhs1.c

<5/10/00> Notes: Found a monster chart and an example in Feldegast's open
directory ;) I am going to write out some monsters to add to these rooms 
and write out the theme/storyline (hopefully) within the next few days. 
I am also going to fix up the line length on the rooms. I didn't remember
if it was 70 or 75 lines. 

<5/14/00> Updated much of /players/jara/area1/docks/ today.. am now 
waiting for Feldegast to look over it so I can make the needed changes.
I've added directories for the rest of this area, and I have started to
map out the entrance to the city/market

<5/16/00> Mapped the city and paths that surround it. I started work on
the paths yesterday, made the changes in /docks and am now going to 
start work on /paths and /city before this area will be open.
