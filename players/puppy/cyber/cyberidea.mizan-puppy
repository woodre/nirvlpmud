Putting auto sensei back in or what?  Something should change or no?
*** I'd like to put auto sensei back into the guild.  The way it was before
I changed that was that once you advanced to the top belt you attained the
rank of sensei.  Right now it strictly limits recruiting.  I don't want to
turn it into the vamps or anything by having others approve people but at
the same time I'd like people who to join to be serious about the cybers.
We're always going to have the few people that are the problem children.
It's just part of the game I guess.


Command for matrix to set directive number to go along with voting
*** I would like to set the number of directives that are "allowed."  This
should be the only thing a matrix would have to do with the officer process
from this point on.  Possibly 'set_directive #' could be the command.
Amending the voting system to check the number of current directives before
alowing a vote for a new one.

Conflict resolution
*** We have a system (I guess) but is it working?


Invader "trap"
*** Now I'm not proposing players being trapped inside the guild but I do
think that spamming people with the entrance message isn't right.  Some
other guilds won't allow people to enter but I think that is wrong.  If
cybers feel they are the best pkers on the mud I still think that they need
to prove this and have there hall open to all and the mobs in that hall be
killable.  If we were to "force" them to stay in the hall for about 30
seconds people would have a chance to defend the home.  I'm not thrilled
with the idea of putting a mob into the guild (i.e. shardak or knights
guilds) but it is an option.  Any thoughts on this one?  Any thoughts on
the matter?


Exp problem when joining
*** Long ago when you joined you couldn't use any existing freer experience
that you had to advance in the guild.  This forced people to A. party or b.
to learn to fight with what they had at first and become stronger players
because of that.  Admittedly this was hard because low level ninjas are not
the greatist fighters.  Some of the old school members like myself (heh)
didn't have a problem advancing to be "upstanding members of Ninjaality."
I propose to turn this back on.  I think there is still code around in the
files for that.  I looked into doing it a long time ago and just couldn't
figure it out.


*****Look into adding dishonor for killing kids and pets or just coding it 
out.  I'm honestly tired of hearing about the matter. 


*****Should we update where people can teleport to...see some ideas below
IDEA BOARD...
->> read 1
The note is titled 'idea for path(tenchu)':

was thinking we should have a path from dark paths to the continent because
it is also one of the premier pk areas on here just a thought do with it 
what you will
thanx

*****The note is titled 'PK alert(pike)':

An idea to create something along the lines of CyberNet, or PKnet.  Would 
have multiple satelites moving in orbits around Nirvana, and would let a 
ninja know when an enemy wanders into a pk area.  This would have to be 
an enhancement, costing hundreds of thousands of credits, but would be 
kinda neat, especially when the lazy legends cant pay attention;) 
~~~PKnet Alert >> Pike is open to attack!
or if it were allowed to give specific details
~~~PKnet >> Pike is currently in << Fiendsville >>
It would only go off once, when a player enters an area, not when the 
player moves around inside a pk area.

Pike

Type cpknet to see what PK net might look like.


***(See the copy of the mail message to me below) I think that this credit
cost per weapons is a good idea.  Right now I have it set up that if you do
not wield the guild weapon or are unarmed that you lose honor.  This would
"force" people to learn to fight and pk with the guild weapon or lose there
honor.  This might not mean much to some but for those true role players it
would hurt.  Not to mention that almost everything in the guild is tied to
a players honor.
I'm not opposed to getting rid of the ATM but I think that we could 
possibly 'donate' credits to newbie players.  Say put a cap of 100k that 
would add to there total credit allowance.  i.e. If Mizan is a new recruit
he can add the present limit of 200k credits to his account for purchases 
but any other ninja could add a max of 100k to that making the total at 
300k (think this is too much we could go 150k / 50k)

In the interest of balance, I had an idea about our weps.  Once cybers are
maxed and have all their ens, there's not a real big demand for credits.
Therefore, it's a lovely feature that we have that just collects dust.  My
thought was to tack on a credit cost for each and every time we draw our
cyber weps.  (even unarmed).
This way we have a use for credits, and makes us a bit more on the level
with other guilds.
I mean, other guilds need to either A: kill a mob for a wep which uses
heals
which cost money. B: use a hotel storage slot to store weapons (I use mine
to store full heals) or C: use lockers, which cost money to initially store
the wep.
I'd also like to see a cap of some sort put on the atm...it's sorta getting
out of hand.  Hell, I wouldn't mind seeing it disappear altogether.
Again,
I'm thinking fairness across the board here.  It's a great tool for newbie
ninjas to buy their ens...but that's about all it's used for.
Ponder these and lemme know what ya think.
Thanks,
D


*****Miz and Pup to go through idea board notes that are left and chat 
about each - if we want to do it  


*****Is set_task, laws working or do they need to be nixed/changed?

*****I've been thinking of putting sensei back in the way it was  once 
you attain top levels and chips you are a sensei.  I thought it would 
help but I honestly don't know anymore.
