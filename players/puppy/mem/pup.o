Please, never forget what happened.**As we all remember the events of a year ago and mourn in our own little way, we must not forget the soldiers who are still fighting to rid this fine planet of terrorist.Today, at this moment, soldiers are fighing hard in far off places where eyes can not see there bravery. And these are not all unknown soldiers to us all. I know of friends who got deployed, and I say a pray for them to keep them safe.Myself I am also a national guardsmen, and if called upon I will do everything in my power to help in the battle. To honor those brave firefighters and emergency personal who struggled to get as many to safety.To honor the fallen people, and to keep our way of life free.GOD BLESS AMERICAcooper**the following words are from a memorial dated september 6, 1996for another site and purpose, but which apply today:"We must never forget thatfreedom is never really free.It is the most costly thingin the world.  Freedom is never paid in a lump sum.Installments come due in everygeneration.  All any of us can do is offer the generationsthat follow a chancefor freedom.**Memorial is a time of rememberance.We remember those killed on September 11, 2001.Please do not forget this day.I will do anything to help those who need support, and who need help.And i believe that you should as wellIt is an honor to us that people sacrificed their life for their country. Those who surived are the heors and herions who are fighting this battle, and who we hope will win.We will win, we are strong.Be well my friends. and be safe.~Whoa~**As we today remember and reflect on our nation's tragedy...     I am so very, very thankful that Kevin and Howie came home that day...**This is a wonderful memorial dedicated to those who have died, but as Cooper added, do not forget our active military, reserve military, and all the veterans who have given so much to ensure our freedoms.  As a military veteran, the life was hard, and often people forget about those who are serving and have served.  To all those that are serving, you are, and will always be appreciated in my heart.  Do our country proud in all your endevours.  Fair winds and following seas:Vistar**When the phone rings on a cold winter saturday afternoon, I hope that it's you..I'll remember you...for all the small things you seem to forget..Like tying your shoes, or taking my son for a walk in the rain with no umbrella..I'll remember you...when you tossed me in the pool with my wedding dress on...I'll remember you..In the spring when I collect the fallen green tomatoe's, you taught me how to eat..I'll just remember you..**i am not exactly sure how to express my feelings or write down my thoughts about the horrific day of September 11th.all i know is i will never forget where i was, who i was with and how i felt when i first heard the news of a plane crashing into that might building.horrifed, astonished and disbelief was how i felt as i watched America being attacked.....as the day moved on i still had the same feelingsyet as i watched people reuniting with loved ones, victims walking away from the destruction..i began to feel hopeful and joy.you may wonder why i would feel a few ounces of joy on such a day....seeing people walk away from such a tragedy is a miracle to me...it gave me a sense of hope that Americans were strong enough to overcome, put their fears aside and save themselves.i personally do not know what i would of done if i was put in that situation...wether it was being trapped in the tower, sitting in the pentagon or in the air over Pennsylvania...i can not even fathom it.as we all saw the news clips, we watched people plummet to their deaths, race down stairwells and run for their lives from the bellowing smoke and fire.i would hope that i would be strong enough to make it out and not perish, but how can one sit there and say what they would do if they have never been in that situation?you never know what you would do.to this day i still sit in awe as i watch the tragic events repeat on tv....i do believe in 50 years i will still be feeling the same way.i am proud that when American fell to her knees that day..she stood back up as quickly as she fell.i am proud to be an American*Curse***One of the smartest statements that I've ever heard, was one referringto WWII (hitler, camps, etc). Someone once said to me"The day people forget that terrible tradegy...will be the day it begins to happen again.The next time, we may not be so lucky."I think about that statement all the time, and I have realizedthat it is very much true. In the sense, that memory is allwe have left to protect ourselves from the past, and the future.So, with that thought, I urge you to always remember...don't push it to the side, talk about it often...teach your children and your children's children...learn from this, and improve upon one another.Bless those that shed blood for us, they are all heros to me.God Bless America, there are heros in all of us.~Autumn~**One of the first things I saw today when I got to campus wassomeone kicking a chipmunk, which are overly friendly there,then watching it hobble away, broken and in pain.  And Icouldn't help wondering who would do such a thing, andespecially on such a day.  I was afraid we had all alreadyforgotten the horror of that morning last year.  I am thankful I was wrong.  My school had a beautiful ceremonytoday, and most professors on campus cancelled their classesto allow us all to attend.  It was a gorgeous day here, andstanding together as one helped to ease the pain as the bellswere tolled for the known Penn State alumni killed in the attacks.  We all felt a part of it, a connection.  May it everbe that way, and may we never forget.  Forgetting would be, by far,the worst thing that we as a nation could do.  But let us not also,in future years, turn it into a day of picnics and parades.  Weneed to always remember the events of last year in solemnity, andrespect for the lives lost.StarFor those interested in another type of rememberance, there is asite I stumbled upon today.  911memorialquilt.com contains anonline quilt with more than 420,000 patches.  Add your own, andnever forget.**I am the black serenityI am the secret flowing rainbowI am the inside colossusI am the weakest eternal wishI am the graceful fingerprintI am the waterfall of impossibilityI am the youngest I'll ever beI am the essence of myselfI am the perfection of tangibilityI am the concrete longingI am the simple, complete humanI am the most transient shadowI am the representation of pure pastI am the one, one thingI am the always powerful restraintI am the breathing futureI am the perfectly magnified soul**I wake up each morning with a prayer.I go to sleep each night after saying a prayer,I pray for all on Earth, and that someday we allmay get alone..And I GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!.**I just want to say that it is great that we are all thinking of the firemen and police that perished on Sept 11 and all of the armed forces that are now fighting and thats great, but these people are just doing their jobs it what the job entails, they aren't doing it for free.  Everyone talks about what heros these people are but what about the guy who was just going into work that day and all of a sudden his building came under attack?  No one seems to talk much about the innocent people that just died while drinking their coffee.
