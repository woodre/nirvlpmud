Cyber proposals:

I would like the do the following changes to the cyber guild.
Dragnar is going to help/tutor me since in all reality it's 
been a very long time since I actually touched anything that
matters.  He tells me that guild balance is really your dept
so here goes...

Prestige:
I'd like to add to the totel number of fluxes allowed for
those cybers that choose to prestige.  The norm is currently
set at six and for the first time I would like to up that to
eight.  After that each time a cyber does it they would get
an additional one.







I'd like to add more belt levels (possibly up to 100)

I'd like to have them have a reason to defend the guild hall.
A mob that sells cyber heals and adrenaline (would have to 
disable the current selling of it and being able to have more
than one i think)

dodging attacks

more attacks per round

spell to start the attack
