     I have been assigned to make changes in most of the older quests so that
the cheat sheets floating around do not reflect accurate solutions.  I try to
leave the quests basically the same but with enough changes to make the players
look again.  Here's what I did in your Mash quest.  I changed Burns so that
when you 'search' after you kill him, you find a small key instead of the pass.
The key fits the lockers in Hawkeye's room but you must kill him before you
can open it.  Lastly, I 'hid' the corn cob pipe in the supply room so that
you must also 'search' there to find it.  I
hope you find this accecptable.  If you have any questions or concerns,
please do not hesitate to contact me.  Thanks for you cooperation...
