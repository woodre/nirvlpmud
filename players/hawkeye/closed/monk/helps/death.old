Death Field

The spell death field is the most awesome by far in the monks
arsenal. There is an element of risk in using this spell though.
Not only using the 100 spell points, it is using all of your hit
points except a certain few. The damage it does to each monster
is dependent on the number of hitpoints the spell used.
So the more hit points you have when casting it, the more
damage you will do. The element of danger enters in
during each cast and depends on the number of monsters 
you attack. If you attack 1 monster you have a small chance
of being hurt. On the other hand, if you attack 5 monsters
you have 5 times the chance of being hurt. This is an
extremely risky spell but will do massive damage. The 
choice is up to you if and when you use it. Learn
to harness this power and you will be deadly.
