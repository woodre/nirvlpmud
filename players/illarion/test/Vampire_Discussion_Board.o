When posting, keep the following guidelines in mind.  1. Be specific.  Name the exact ability you're posting about, old or new. Explain exactly why it is outdated or is needed.  2. Be thematic.  Only abilities which fit the guild theme will be added, no matter what other guilds can do.  3. Be creative.  Abilities should have a flare that make them uniquely vampiric, especially if other guilds already have a similar ability.  PS:  Read the instructions for this board.  It will let you comment on ideas posted by other vampires.  I encourage you to do this, but be sure to continue to follow the guidlines, and to keep things polite. ",({}),5,"Poster: Damon Subject: new skills Time: 24 Jan 2014 14:36","a stun for mobs called compulsion and a deathblow were we rip out the heart out of the mob / player were fighting ",({}),10,"Poster: Ozzy Subject: wolf combat monitors Time: 20 Apr 2014 21:07","with more mobs doing side hits now, i feel we need combat monitors for our wolfs. ",({}),11,"Poster: Ozzy Subject: new skill idea Time: 20 Apr 2014 21:10","hypnotize... prevent mobs from fleeing by staring into thier eyes and bending thier will to ours  ",({}),12,"Poster: Ozzy Subject: new skill Time: 20 Apr 2014 21:49","soulripper we can remove the soul of weakend enemies an devour them as they watch and die ",({}),14,"Poster: Zenobia Subject: Eiljah Time: 23 Apr 2014 21:33","I don't wax poetic, so this is a simple note.
