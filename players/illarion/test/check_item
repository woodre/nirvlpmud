Usage: check_item <target>

   Use this command to report a monster or item that you think
   might be in need of an update with different damage types.
   If you report something that has already been updated or
   reported, you'll be notified.  Otherwise a record will be
   left, and a wizard will look at the item as soon as possible.
   
   Please note that only powerful items and weapons need to be
   reported.
