Weapon enchantments have been added to weapon.c, meaning they can
be used on almost any weapon.

Here's how they work:

weapon_ob->add_enchantment(name,short_desc,long_desc,dam,dtype,
                           seconds,hits,function,ob);

returns: 1 for success
         0 for failure
         -1 for already exists
                          
                           
name: a unique name for the enchantment.  you have to remove an
      enchantment of a given name before you can add another of
      that name. example:  templar_weapon_enchant

short_desc: if not 0, added to the weapon's short()

long_desc: if not 0, added to the weapon's long()

dam: the amount of damage to add.  it's added to any other damage
     the weapon does, and then auto-randomized

dtype: the dtype of the enchantment.  1 per enchantment

seconds: how long the enchantment should last.  if 0, the enchantment
         is not terminated based on time.

hits: how many hits the enchantment should last.  If 0, the enchantment
      is not terminated based on hits.

function: the function to call for extra stuff.  it's passed the target
          for the attack and the weapon that's enchanted  the return of
          the function is added to the amount

ob: the object where the function is.  If 0, the weapon itself is
    queried

Other functions:
    
remove_enchantment(name) to remove an enchantment
1 for success, 0 for failure

query_echantment(name) returns 0 if there isn't one, or the stats
of the enchant if there is.

query_enchantments() returns an array of all the names of the weapon's
enchantments.

NOTE: enchanted weapons DO NOT SAVE.  Make sure there is some way to
remove an enchantment unless you want the weapon made unsavable.
