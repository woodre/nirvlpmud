Armor enchanting works just like weapon enchanting, with the following
differences:

add_enchantment takes one final argument: resistance (a number representing
the percent by which the specified dtype will be reduced.  negative numbers
result in a damage increase)

the enchantment only takes a "hit" when the wearer is targeted with the
specified dtype.

as with normal armor returns, the returns from the enchantment special
function, if any, are divided by 100 to check for resistance.  This means:
special function returns 2     2 ac bonus
special function returns -2    2 ac penalty
special function returns 2000  20% resistance, no ac modified
special function returns 5003  50% resistance, 3 ac bonus
special function returns -2500 25% vulnerability, no ac modified
special function returns -3004 30% vulnerabilty, 4 ac penalty


As with weapons, enchanted armor DOES NOT SAVE.
