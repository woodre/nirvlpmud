message_data ({7,"Poster: Someone Subject: PK idea Time: 10 Dec 2004 16:51","I know some people liked it and some didn't, but switchingback to the semi-failed experiment of \"no-loss\" pk might enliven the place a bit.  Heck, people that neverdreamed of pk were fighting back then...maybe they'dbe pulled back in by the lure of it.  Just a thought!",({4,"Poster: Someone Subject: PK risks Time: 10 Dec 2004 17:59","I think PK needs a risk beyond loosing stuff, or it becomes prettymuch meaningless.  A different risk might be interesting- does anyonehave any suggestions?",10,"Poster: Martha Subject: PK Time: 13 Dec 2004 08:54","I don't PK, so my idea here might be not so good.  But maybe give a small incentive for having pk set.  Some item that you can use only if PK is set...maybe regardless of what guild you are in. It can be armor, a wep, or even like a blocker of some sort, to deflect damage if you are hit by someone who does not have this special piece of armor.  They would have to do something to get this armor more than just setting PK, but it seems people enjoy the challenge of getting whatever is needed to kill other players. ",17,"Poster: Chip Subject: Lossless PK, I approve of this AWESOME idea! Time:  4 Jan 2013 08:02","Why the hell not? It really just might liven it up a little more again around here. Worth a shot. ",}),8,"Poster: Illarion Subject: High Level Gear Time: 12 Dec 2004 16:08","Several different wizards (including me, I'm sure) have mentioned how over time almost every player that uses gear tends to be using the exact same pieces of gear.  I think we should have a discussion in comments to this message about why this happens, and about what you think is a good way to fix it.  If we can come to a consensus, I'll implement it.   Note that this board has some extra editing options now - it can format text, and let you delete, replace, and insert new lines in your message.  Please give that a try if you will, and let me know how it works out. ",({5,"Poster: Martha Subject: High Level GEar Time: 12 Dec 2004 19:24","Since I am not the best with code, I do not know if this will work. But...can we limit the amount of gear that goes out?  Or maybe the amount allowed on the mud at one time?   Example: Everyone has a Gordie Stick.  Maybe we can limit the number being used at any one given time? I am not sure if this is workable, but it might help some of the problem. I am working on coding some decent high level gear, but my creativity has been nil as of late.  I'll get back into the swing soon tho. Hope it helps some. ",7,"Poster: Illarion Subject: unique/limited gear Time: 12 Dec 2004 23:02","It's quite possible to limit gear like that, Martha- there are even several different possible variations. We can limit items to only a certain number of copies each boot, or only a certain number of copies at any given time. Unique items tend to lead to a rush on the monster that has them when the mud first boots up.  We'd have to make them non-savable, or there'd just be a rush to the lockers, which wouldn't be much fun.  I think this would be an especially good idea if each unique item has one thing about it that nothing else on the mud does - that way, in addition to there only being one of the item, it really has a unique attribute.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to particular items? ",8,"Poster: Francesco Subject: limit gear Time: 13 Dec 2004 03:18","One way to limit the gear is to let it be useable ONLY by the one who actually killed the mob which was carrying it. I know it would involve massive re-coding of old stuff, but it could be easy implemented on new ones :) my two cents.  fran ",9,"Poster: Martha Subject: gear storage Time: 13 Dec 2004 08:50","Perhaps limiting how the gear is stored as well. For example, I could have 5 bracers of speed or misty cloaks stored in my locker, you know, just in case I lose one.  Maybe I should only be allowed to store one at a time in the lockers.  People would still get around it by storing one in the locker and one in their hotel room, but if the hotel rooms were set up that way as well, you could only store a max of 2 of one item instead of 5. ",11,"Poster: Khrell Subject: gear Time: 13 Dec 2004 17:20","Well I for one welcome the idea of limiting gear for players. I agree that perhaps items that are usually the 'hot' items, should be extremely rare, and in limited numbers of available. Right now the 'A finely honed sword' is the weapon of choice as is the Xetra Claws.  I think certain items should be of a unique nature and thusly be limited to ONE per player peroid. Perhaps we could make some items no drop so they can't be easily traded to others, or perhaps a 'lore' item, meaning that you can only ever posess one at a time, but if you loose the item you can get a replacement. ",15,"Poster: Jaraxle Subject: Gear Ideas Time: 30 Dec 2004 01:30","I am always an advocate for making gear \"wear\" out like the weapons do.  This way you can not just sack up on gear and not need any until either A) crash, B) someone steals it when you die, or C) Idle time away from the mud and you lose a hotel/motel/casino room.   I like the idea of \"unique\" classed armors - where only a certain amount of a specific item is allowed on the mud - but how about this idea as well: Some players like to aquire items just for the \"Challenge\" they don't actually use the item - what if as a side note to the unique items we allow a player to have their own \"Museum Armory\" of sorts, where they can 'display' any item they want, and it will not count towards this limit we set on an item being on the field.  Also - maybe to help with the ransack of people rushing to a mob or rushing to a locker to be one of the first to pull out a \"legendary\" item  especially with the long reboots we got going on now, perhaps limiting how many of these special armors someone can have at one time - so they have to  actually choose what they want to use - and leave something behind.  Just some ideas. ",}),10,"Poster: Jaraxle Subject: Bards and Enchantments Time: 13 Jan 2005 13:23","I think now that we have the enchantments for weapons and armors that Illarion so lovingly coded for us, there should also be a nice guild ability to check enchantments on items of this nature.  Bards are perfect for this.  SURE SURE, we can code NPC and items that do this for our players to make our own realms popular.. but how about letting a guild be popular for a little while when in need instead.  Would be a nice touch. :) ",({}),})
