Proposed note for living changes:

It is generally the practice of Nirvana's wizards not to
reveal specific information about the workings of the
code.  We feel it can lessen enjoyment of the game and
lead to unnecessary temptation to cheat.

However, a serious problem has come to our attention
that you as players should be aware of.  For quite some
time now (we're not sure how long) almost every monster
in the game has been much easier than its experience
value would indicate.  This was caused by an error in
how armor class is applied.  Basically everyone has
been doing too much damage to NPCs.

This problem has now been corrected, and most of you
will probably notice it will take a lot longer to kill
most monsters.

At the same time, we have also changed an intentional
restriction on the amount of damage you're able to do.
As you progress through both normal and extra levels,
the amount of damage you're able to do to your opponent
will gradually increase.
