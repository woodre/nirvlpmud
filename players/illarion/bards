The Bards of Ryllian are a rather eccentric lot of poets, dreamers,
and rogues, drawn together by their thirst for knowledge and their
willingness to take dangerous and stupid risks in persuit of that
knowledge.

Most of a Bard's magic is in the form of spellsongs, created through
the use of special music and enchanted instruments provided to
members by the guild.  In return for the knowledge and magic,
Bards are expected to contribute both knowledge and their own
unique style to the guild.

Persuit of knowledge of all forms has taught the Bards something
about nearly everything- they have spells for combat, healing,
and for changing the world around them.  However, since their
primary concern is the collection of more lore, Bardic spells do
not kill (though a Bard's blade will do so), and Bards are
forbidden all forms of player versus player combat.

A Bard's advancement in the guild depends on his or her ability to
first master, and then add to Bardic lore with new songs and
knowledge.  Aspiring Bards should first seek out any Bard for
more information about the guild, and then a Guild Commander should
they desire to be recruited.
