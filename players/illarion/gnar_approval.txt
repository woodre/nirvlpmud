I do believe i have completed the 'problematic' issues, and all accounted for here. thanks for the review gnar, i appreaciate it. :)
oh i almot forgot the justification for all the mobs. here is the breakdown.

Eventualy, there will be a Quest in this area, along with some nice gear rewards.  as a Reward for the Quest, you will be presented
With a 'stake'that will be able to 'kill' the vampires in here, at that point when wielding this weapon, or having it in inv upon death
it will dest the corpse, and instead replace the corpse with 'corpse dust' the goal is to have a scaling armor system, all 18 slots,
and have the armor go up in level via battle, the armors will cost 100 corpse dust each, then every 5 levels, (max of 20 on armors) you 
may spend a additional 100 dust to 'upgrade' the armor in one of so many set ways. hence this will be fairly costly considering 18 slots
300 dust per armor, 18x500=9000 dusts. hence why so many mobs...but when killed with stake, they will not drop coins or anything, just dust



NPC
-----------------------
***complete***bvampboss.c
  - set_multi_cast should be either 0 or 1, 5 is the same as 1
  - Why the set_hp_bonus of 650? It is inflating his exp worth
  - Need to check the value of the grace and cube. Max coins for level 22 is total of 7k. You have 
    13,500 avg coins plus 7k weapon and 2 non-tox heals. (lowerd to 1)
  - What is the special advantage? (multi-Cast?)
    - obj/grace (7200)
    - closed/cube x1 now :P 
    - 13500 coins 1k+rndom 8k, avg 5k
***Complete***bvamp.c
  - Max value for level 21 is 6k. Mob has 9500 avg plus
  - won't require it, but I'd prefer to see the updated add_spell functionality
    You cannot have more than 1 add_spell_dam, the 2nd call just overrides the
    first, same with set_spell_mess. This vamp will only fire the 2nd spell. That
    is why add_spell preferred. Also, you have tpn in the string of the
    message, it will never pull in the players name.
      - obj/vmace (1200)
      - 9500 coins
***Complete***lvampboss.c
  - set_hp_bonus ? same as bvampboss
  - Long has a comment about a ring like mikal, but he doesn't have a ring?  FIXXED.
  - "other|physical" is wrong, should just be physical. But that is the default so if you pass in 0
    it will default to physical.                                             FIXXED
  - Max value for level 20 is 5k. Gear as stated is over 20k plus nontox heals. FIXXED. (UPPED LEVEL UPPED ABILITIES, DECREASED VALUES INCREASED COINS+HPS ACCORDING TO DOC/BUILD/MONSTER/MONSTER.GUIDE)
    - obj/necklace (5000)
    - obj/vsword (7200)
    - obj/pants (10000)
    - closed/cube x2
***good to go?***lvampire.c
  - Same comments about spells as bvamp.c
    - 3000 coins ok for lev 19
***complete***mikal.c  lowerd to 1 notox, lowerd value of items, kept hp_bonus.
  - set_hp_bonus ?
  - set_multi_cast
  - Value is high with gear + nontox heals
    - obj/dring (3000)
    - obj/vmace (1200)
    - closed/cube x2

***complete***mvampboss.c  lowerd to 1 heal, lowerd value pants.
  - set_hp_bonus ?
  - set_multi_cast 
    - obj/pants (10000)
    - closed/cube x2
***complete***mvampire.c lowerd coins..esc...
  - set_multi_cast
  - Max value for level 21 is 6k
    - 7750 coins
overall
  - For each mob over level 20 please have a comment at the top of the file that specifically
    lists the "special" advantage requirements in the build rules for monsters.
  - Not sure what to do with the cubes. Snow demons are level 22 with high wc and only give 1 ice sphere.
    And ice spheres have a drawback of melting. You need to work on the value of your mobs, rethink
    it and let me know.
  - Your boss mobs should have more unique long descriptions, they each have
    pretty much the same description.
  - Some of the formatting is all over the place. Try to indent evenly, if you are having issues with
    FTP let me know.
OBJ
----------------------

    - 20% 3.5 hps
***complete***necklace.c
  - Max 2% reduction in dark/evil damage
  - Reduce sps heal to random(10), reduce %, or change firing mechanism to use stats/prestige something unique
    - 5 + random(5) sps heal
    - 10% other|dark
    - 10% other|evil
    - -5% other|light
***complete***pants.c lowerd BF bonus, upped %, lowerd value
  - Per Fred, +5 to both BF stats would be the max for non main armor
  - Over 40% chance to heal 5 sps with max luck. Need to fix the fire mechanism 
    for this bonus.
***complete***vmace.c
  - Max return for weapon_hit of 3 unless you add restrictions based on previous comments.
    - wc 15 + 3 other|evil
    - 20% chance of return 5
vsword.c weapons are BS lol, let this one go....rofl
  - Avg wc of 25 is too high, lower % of special (see previous comments)
    - wc 20 + 3
    - 40% chance of return 5
Zan.c
  - Not used, remove?
overall
  - I like you use of luck stat in the pants, I'd like to see more variety in
    the gear bonuses and the requirements for them to fire, like use of stats or
    prestige level or other unique things.
  - I'd like to see weps and armor in their own dirs, but won't require you
    update it now. If not then remove wep/armor dirs.
    
ROOMS
-----------------------
ldeck5.c
  - add_action search added but function not defined. Search in room gives error.
  - Hint in room long says covered up door. However the item is "doors". You can have
    a item for door and doors by using the & notation. You don't want a better hint for going
    west?
    "lot", "A Parking Lot",
    "parking lot", "&lot&",
labpath3.c
  - search broken like ldeck5
abarracks7.c
  - 3 ways to go n. Search debris only works once, but pass and north always work, was
    that what was intended?
medlab4, medlab5, medlab6.c
  - newline messed up at the end of the room long.
medlab4.c
  - Room long map doesn't match exists
labhall.c
  - empty file, remove?
overall
  - Too many mobs in the area, try to randomize it? I'd suggest 30 / 20 / 12
  - Why using jareel's define.h? Dependencies like this causes maintenance issues
  - Avoid putting in the long the item descriptions ex: labpath3 the shelves description
    is in the long as well as the shelves item.
