Syntax: ls
        ls -<options>
        ls <path>
        ls -<options> <path>
        
Lists all the files in path.  If path is blank, the current directory
is used.  The path is relative to your current directory unless it
begins with / or ~.  / makes it relative to the mud root directory,
~/ makes it relative to your directory, and ~wizname makes it relative
to wizname's dir.

By default, the files are sorted by type: dirs, .h files, .c files, then
other files, then by aphabetical order.  Files are marked with an 
approximation of their size in kilobytes, and with a * for loaded .c 
files.  At the end of the list, the total number of directories and
files displayed is shown, as well as the total size of the files found,
in kilobytes.

If path is a single file, that file's modified timestamp is displayed.

Here are the possible options.  Note that options must be preceeded by a
dash (-) and must not contain any spaces.

  old        Use old-style ls (other options don't apply)
  h or ?     Show a brief help file.
  w<#>       Specify your screen width from 60-120.  Default is 80.
  c<#>       Specify the max number of columns displayed.  If the list
             won't fit in your screen width, the number of columns is 
             reduced, to a minimum of 1.
  S          Show the full fize size in bytes (up to 6 digits)
  s          Don't show the file size at all
  L          Don't check for loaded .c files
  d          Don't sort the list by filetypes.
