Nirvana presents...  real Player Killers.

This message goes out to you, mister PK spell abuser.
(mister PK spell abuser!)

While some PKer's accept it when they can't kill someone, you know those PKers are just pussies.
(You're a REAL man!)

You spend hours combing through help files, entering negative numbers, and trying to trick wizards.
(Whatever it takes now!)

When that loser finally dies, that rush of satisfaction makes it all worth it, even when it leads to the ability getting nerfed.
(You're the best, you're the best, yeah!)

So throw down a cold one at Llew's, peak of the playerkillers!  They just hate you because they can't be you.
