Keeping the interest of endgame, or maxed players

Once players reach +100 there is little reason for them to keep
playing, at least as their current character.  Even changing guilds
for a different gameplay experience isn't too appealing, because of
the experience hit.

1: Remorting -
  Players drop to a much lower game level, but are inherently more
  powerful than non-remorted players of the same level.
  As a side benefit, players would have already lost levels, so they
  might as well try a new guild.

2: Skills -
  Give players named skills in certain areas that they can continue
  to raise indefinately, with a diminishing return as they approach
  higher levels.  Some examples might be faster healing rates, the
  ability to dodge or resist certain types of damage, or skill with
  a weapon.
  
  Guilds could provide more specialized skills (or restrict global
  skills) - relating, for example, to cheaper sp costs for abilities,
  deathblows working at higher hp, or more spell damage

3: Upgradable Equipment -
  Provide the ability to upgrade basic equipment so that it's on a
  par with the best equipment available in the game, but only by
  spending massive amounts of money and time finding special items.
  
  More powerful equipment might give a smaller bonus to players of
  lower levels, to discourage excessive "tweaking".
