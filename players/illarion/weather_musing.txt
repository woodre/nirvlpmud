A very simple weather model:

temp:   cold, normal, hot
clouds: none, p cloudy, overcast
wind:   none, some, lots
humid:  dry, normal, wet
precip: none, some, lots

By default, rooms will be considered to be outdoors.  They can change
this by returning something for query_room_type():
0: outdoor
1: indoor (limited weather effects)
2: no weather (underground, in a dimension with no weather, etc)

Each directory is considered to be a different region for the purpose
of weather.  The model will check for the file default_weather in
each dir, and check for two functions:
no_weather()
0: weather done as normal
1: there is no weather for the entire dir
[areas like the underdark or jello could make use of this]
default_weather()
return an array with the default values from the variables above
this will default to: ({1,0,0,1,0})

The weather in each area is decided according to these variables-
some combinations have more than one possible type of weather.
That weather lasts for a half-hour, assuming someone is still in the
area, and then of the values above is randomized and the weather is



An even simpler model:  Each type of weather has a set of other
weather types that can follow it:

calm
