Bard Skills:

Fencing:
  If successful, gen_wc bonus of 1+random(bard level/2)
  (replaces the 1+random(4) bonus from the alliance)

Parry:
  Checked on the first (and only the first) physical attack
  made on a bard in each hb.  If successful, the bard
  gets 25+bard level*5/2 % damage reduction
  
Offhand:
  5+random(bard level) additional damage on a successful
  check.  Also must have a bard "dirk" equipped.
  
Perform:
  If successful, adds random(bard level+1) damage (or healing)
  to applicable abilities.  Some bard abilities have
  durations- in those cases, the duration is boosted
  and not the damage/healing.
  
Bond:
  Affects performance of pets in combat- a successful
  check gives the pet a chance for additional damage,
  dependant on the pet's basic power.  (only implemented
  after pets are reworked)
