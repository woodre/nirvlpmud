Your attributes affect your skills in two ways.  First,
each skill is linked to a particular attribute that affects
how easy that skill is to use.  Second, attributes control
how likely you are to learn something from an attempt to
use a skill.  Nowhere in these files will you find which
attribute controls what.  That is up to you to discover.
