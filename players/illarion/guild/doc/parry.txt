There is little difference between striking at an enemy and
swinging your blade in such a way that it blocks or
deflects an enemy's strike.  Your parry skill allows you to
use your blade to attempt to block physical strikes made
against you.  If successful, the strike will not land at
all, but your blade will absorb the same amount of force as
it would making an attack.
