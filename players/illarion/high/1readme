This is an area based on Highlander: The series
Practically, this means that the monsters players kill should get back up
again after a short while, and that while not visibly armed, they always
keep a sword nearby (some of the monsters, anyway)
To facilitate that, I've coded some extra inheritors, which are
documented within themselves.
I've also defined the three basic paths of the area in ~/dfns.h,
which hopefully will make the code more readable, and easier to
move, if that becomes necessary

Access to most of the area is provided through "flashbacks", something
which happens a lot in the TV series: Duncan stares at something, and
the story shifts to something that happened to him in the past.  The
observant player will notice that some of the words in item descriptions
are highlighted in bold, and represent add_actions.  Eventually, those
will allow the player to access a "flashback".  (making this
a very expandible area)

Eventually this could lead to several quests, along the lines of:
  1> Find a way to kill an immortal
  2> Stop the watchers from killing immortals (see the show for details)
  3> influence the Gathering (when the immortals finally dwindle to 1)
  4> save <insert name here> (some immortals are in the rescue business)
  5> learn to use a type of sword (ie raise the special)
