Usage: skills

Skills represent your overall ability with the various facets of your
vampire powers.  The higher your level in a skill, the more powers you
will have access to, and the more likely they are to work well.

Your maker's blood granted you instant access to some skills.  Others
you will need to acquire through exploration, effort, and sacrifice.

There are vhelp entries available for all of the skills you have learned.
