Day of the Ram of the seventh Zyth of the year 10832 AC*,

   So what am I to do?  And where shall I begin?  Perhaps it would be
be best to begin with my return.  Three Zythes and five days ago,
after much traveling among the Creations of the Outer Planes, seeking
the meaning to my Vision and that which had brought me so close to
the High Heavens, I returned here- to this Land of the Living.  I had
expected to return to the arms of my parents and my Sisterhood, only to
find that war had destroyed and demolished all that I had once known.
My Mother had been killed which had sparked the war amoung my Family
and ended with My Father disappearing into the Stone of Nlysis.

* AC = After Creation
  note: it was thought that the year 0 ac was the
        year the Lords of the Outer Planes had created 
        our world.  (editor)
