  Listen, my children, my legacies, the ones who shall follow.
I speak of the visions that our Order follow, the Oath and how it
came about.  I became the first Disciple of Rose after she built
the Great Hall.  I was but a small boy of 12 years, poor and hungry.
I came into the hall seeking food and some shelter when I saw Her.
She was a vision to me, an angel in mortal form.  She bade me to rest
and to eat at the table with her.  That was how it all began.
  She was my light, my angel, and through her I learned all that I 
could about why she had made the hall.  And that was when I swore the
Oath.  For it was what her purpose was, and my purpose was her's.
  Years went by and one day she told me that a dream had told her to
seek the Jade Mountains.  And so we left the hall, heading east. 
We travelled many Corms, we encountered many people, and finally we
reached the fabled mountains of Jade.
