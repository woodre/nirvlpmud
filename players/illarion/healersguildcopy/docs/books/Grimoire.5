    Slowly, through time, I began to question this Law of Hierarchy
[material, energy, infinity] and seeked various ways of controlling 
infinity.  Listen carefully:  What if there was something that 
circumvented this hierarchy?  A wild card in the hand of a game of
poker.  The answer came suddenly and I was awakened.  Magic.  Magic
is the base element, represented as fae, that is a conduit between 
the infinite and energy.  Manipulate the fae <magic> and the Laws
are no longer applicable.  
    So, I did what had to be done.  I asked it.  I asked the fae 
what it wanted. Why?  If one had a dog and treated it as a means to
guard the house- never giving it what it wanted and only what it
needed- the dog would simply guard the house.  Yet, if one gave it 
what it wanted- affection, attention, and whatnot- then it would 
guard the house with all its power and to its greatest capacity.  And
so I asked the fae for its wants and its needs. It wanted a way to
take part with the material and it hungered for it much.  So I gave
material to it- i sacrificed things- and it listened to me.  And 
new powers were opened and so the manner was sacrifice, the object 
infinity.
