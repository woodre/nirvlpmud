    It was here in those Mountains, at the very heart was the 
Orb.  It was an orb of peace, of tranquility. It gladdened our 
hearts and lightened our burdens and granted us both a wish.
    Unfortunately, the peace did not last. A dark man of scowling
face and burning eyes came and threatened our security.  He sought
to shatter the Orb for his purpose was a dark one.
    My beauty and love was lost to me that day.  She seemed to know 
the man.  They quarreled, they fought, and then they vanished.
    Understand this my Children, our purpose is but one.  Heal the
Path, serve it, and enlighten others of it.  Bind yourself to your
Oath, for it is both noble and of great worth.  Remember your Oath.
