    I could feel nothing but the greatest sorrow to see the once 
powerful and beautiful Order had been reduced to a mass of squabbling
goblins of hatred and fear.  I asked Lamerith how this could have come
about, and all he could answer was with a silence that was both damning
and angry.  Cardiou, my betrothed, too was silent and eventually he left.
  Then one day, as I sat in the halls of the Great Library, a thought 
came to me.  If all that we had strived for was no longer, then our
feet had left the Path.  So to find the Path, one must find its Maker.
And so I now seek He who had come before. For only He can show where
we had gone wrong.  
   And so I leave this memo behind for those who remain, I go to seek
Him, to demand and answer of Him, and to learn from Him
