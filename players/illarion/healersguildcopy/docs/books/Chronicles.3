    He partook with the building of the bard's guild- for he was 
friend to that founder- Harper- and father of another founder-
Star.  He was the one who taught Star the way of magic.  And thus
He has decreed that not one bard shall be touched by Us, else His
wrath shall be brought down upon Us <refer to The Book of Law by 
Him>. 
    The events that led to his leaving of the bards, is not a 
story that is known.  Yet, why he left is simply the fact that he
became disgusted at them.  He felt that their choice of the use of
magic was shallow.  They had the power to do anything, and yet they
chose to play petty illusions and ditties upon their instruments.
They did not See as we have learned to See. And so blindly they
grouped, a band of moralists with a purpose binding them to 
Knowledge, and yet refusing to See Knowledge as it was. He left 
them in disgust and forever cut His child and friend from Him.
