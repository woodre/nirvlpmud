I've made further changes to your quest.  Previously, a cheat sheet
was required to identify the items, as there was no other way to tell
what items were required.  Now, a Gem of Hunting is found in the prize
room and it gets warm or cold depending upon proximity to the hiding
places of the four items.  In order to throw off the cheaters, I've
replaced the klezmeer armor with a new item, the jade figurine found
in Fnest.c which is a new room off of field3.
