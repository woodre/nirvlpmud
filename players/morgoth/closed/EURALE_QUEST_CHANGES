     I have been given the job of changing quests so that the cheat sheets
that are floating around do not reflect accurate solutions.  To that end I
have made the following changes to this quest.  First, I moved the cyclops
so that the entry to the cave is from field14 instead of field3.  The ruby
that was under the rock in field16 is moved to under a rock in Egarden_path2.
Rather than have both the sword and armor found at one time,
I made another monster (Etingler.c) and put the armor on him.
This quest can be done with help and is very easy, all one has to do
is find the four items.  If you have any questions, please feel free to
contact me.  -Eurale
