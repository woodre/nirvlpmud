Power Rangers 4.00 by Beck

The following document will outline the details of the Power Rangers guild revision 4.0
which is created in November 2001.
In this document you will find important information regarding skills, training, and combat.

For this new revision, I am switching to an even more modular system.  This system will 
allow a lot of flexibility regarding advancement, and who creates code.  With this system,
wizards will be able to create Ranger code, using a known set of hooks, to advance the guild.

Training will be unlimited in nature for most items.  There will be no cap for advancement,
but players will have to choose carefully the skills, as the path they take will decide how
they do.

On to the features.

Skills - Skills will be broken down into the following categories.  These categories will
dictate what skill is obtained and used.  All categories will be limitless in advancement,
however, at high levels, there may be no more skills to obtain.  Advancing will usually
help in combat or other areas.

Players get skills by obtaining skill points.  The skill points are received by obtaining 
build points, which are in turn directly donated from experience.
When a player gets enough build points for the next skill point, it is automatically converted
Each skill point cost 1.04 times the last one.  While the first only cost 100 build points,
eventually by # 250 they cost almost 1 million each.

Skill areas:

Morph - The level of Power Ranger training (these are the traditional levels like
		Dino, Thunder, Zeo, etc.)

Combat - Degree of Belt level and overall martial arts skill

Communication - Level of communication sophistication.

Teleport - Level of transportation/teleportation ability.

Leadership - Leadership abilities in combat, and to for recruiting, titles etc.

Team - More powerful skills, that require team members
