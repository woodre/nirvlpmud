messages "Changes/Perspective Part 1(Vital the Obsidian Ranger):**	This is a compilation of the previous 7 notes of Roland the HunterRanger. I have tried to include all the pertinent data to help guide future Rangers with the changes that have been made and to make more space for posting notes on the Globe.1. Separate personal and common power pools. Personal power is saved across 'boots. Must use 'regen' command to fill personal power pool while in the Command Center. Use 'regen_stop' to turn it off. Personal power is drawn from the common power pool.2. Personal Power is used for Morphing, Weapon and Armor.3. The command 'rsc' displays maximum and actual personal power.4. Weapon damage is up 50% at the same cost.5. New command 'encourage' added to help with combat, benefits multiply with multiple Rangers in combat. No cost to use, but must re-issue command each time to use it in combat.**Changes/Perspective Part 2(Vital the Obsidian Ranger):**6. 'Regen' is now 50% faster.7. Quit bitching and whining.8. Being a Ranger Rocks.9. Be efficient in what you chose to fight.10. Party object is taken being taken under consideration.11. 'spam' command can be used to toggle [ OFFENSE ] and [ DEFENSE ] messages during combat.12. Please be inconsideration of drawbacks and theme-related ideas when making suggestions for the guild. Good drawbacks will help modifications get done faster.13. Don't forget the requirement for practice when trying to advance.**combat change(Roland the Hunter Ranger):**In response to demand, there has been a minor change to combat.#1 the damage done by your power weapon has been reduced.  Cost is still the same.#2 there has been an increase to all rangers attack ability.#3 Encourage has the potential to do more damage, especially in partithe larger the party, the better.This is a trial, and I am sure more changes like this are to come.Please try it out and mail me comments.  Make them realistic too.  I am not interested in greedy players, but will do my best to make everyone fight better.Sir Roland.SALUTE!**Newest changes.(Roland the Hunter Ranger):**There are new changes for the guild.#1 The guild membership allowed is now 45.  I have increased this hopefully to get more members on at the same time.The downside to this is that Animal, Dino, and Weapon names will no longer be unique to a ranger.  Color will remain the only unique name for a ranger.#2 The alignment restriction for killing good while morphed no longer applies in pk situations.A ranger may attack another player that has good alignment, but ONLY in cases where they are truly evil.Cyberninjas are the most likely case.Wrath has joined us from the dark rangers, which is why there are now 2 sapphire rangers.I will fix the situation when I get a chance.RolandThe Hunter...................(Ranger)**Random skill(Roland the Hunter Ranger):**If you are asked to learn a skill called 'random' please say no.This is a long standing bug, that I have tried to fix many times, but seems to appear every now and again.Once again I will try and make more fixes, but if you see it dont train it, because it could take away lots of xp from you for nothing.Roland**New Command Center(Roland the Hunter Ranger):**Ther first phase of the new command center has been completed.I'm sure you have already realized it has changed.Currently the basic functionality is the same, but the basis for the new stuff is in place.In the future more enhancements should be coming.The biggest change right now is that you have to go into the regeneration chamber to regen poweryou also have to allocat power from the pool to the chamber first.Other changes are that no outsiders can get into the guild now.Also power will carry over during reboots.EnjoyRoland**New Center(Sundin the Brandy Ranger):**This is Kinda directed tward Beck. It has been brought to my attention that noone can join nor become an ally to the guild right now due to the not being able to get in center. At some point will people once again be able to become allies?The Brandy RangerSundin**I'm back(Tiger the Pearl Ranger):**Hello RangersI just wanted to let you know that i'm back, and that i'm always intrested in rangers parties. I see some new initiates and thunder rangers, if you are new or semi-new to the guild i might not recognize that you are a ranger while i'm fighting, so please send me a tell and i will be glad to give you a tour/help you out. Misses fighting beside you and looking forward to meet you all.Tigerrrrrrr, The Pearl One **"
