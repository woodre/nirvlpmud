messages "Beta Version will open in a few weeks(Beck the 0 Ranger):**Due to my busy schedule I have not been able to work on the guild nearly as often as any of us would like.I have taken your wishes into consideration, and will open a beta version of the guild.My absolute worst date for this opening will be November 18.  I will try to get it in sooner than that though.This probally will not include golds gynm, the thunder megazord, and maybe not even the battlezord.  I will however have a couple of new features.  A better more sensible method of training, some sort of finishing move (probally done automatically), and a couple of surprises.I thank you for your extreme patience.  I am hoping to make this guild the best to play on the mud.Sir Beck**Beta Update(Beck the 0 Ranger):**I have worked for 3 hours on the files and have actually managed to put them in here.I have them all running, in fact Jazz has already done the conversion to the new ranger.I still expect it to take a little time to add some things, work out a couple of bugs, and test it some.Just thought you'd like to know the info.Sir Beck**kewl(Goshawk the Platinum Ranger):**All I can say is woo woo, it's Morphing Time..!   *smiles* Keep up the great work Beck...Laterz..Goshawk the Persistant.**Beta is working better than expected(Beck the 0 Ranger):**I was actually fighting monsters tonight.I also got a lot of bugs out of the training stuff.  it seems to work well.I will allow Tick and Goshawk to convert by early next week if they want to.Beck**Beta conversion(Goshawk the Platinum Ranger):**I definately wanna convert :)  just tell me when I need to be hear and I'll do my best to get here. Laters , keep up the great work :)Goshawk the soon to be improved Platinum Ranger**Better than VHS anyway...(Tick the Azure Ranger):**	Woo hoo hoo!  I've been waiting for this a long time!  =)Just let me know (like Goshawk said) if I need to be on sometime, and I'mcurious about what kinda changes are being made...will we get to keep ourbelt levels, all our moves and stuff we've earned?  If there are new moves andsuch, will they be in the help files so we know what to do?  Just let us in onthe details whenever you get a chance.  But YES I'd be more than happy to beupgraded next week!  =)  Woo hoo.  When will everyone else be changed/thebeta version opened?  Just curious.  Thanks for all the hard work and stuff,beck...you can count on me and Goshawk to spearhead the new Rangers, and makethis the coolest guild on the mud.  =)Thanks,Power Ranger Team Leaderthe Tick.**"
