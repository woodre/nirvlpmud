The Party Object---created by Beck  (Russ Warren)  June 1998

I have recoded a party object which has several improvements and other changes over the origional.

The object is "/players/beck/PartyObject.c"
The master is "/players/beck/PartyMaster.c"

New or changed features:
	The part object now works with a daemon (PartyMaster).
    	All members of every party are loaded into a mapping called Parties within the Master.
	The mapping is keyed by the Party leaders name and has an array of all members.

	the talk channel uses this daemon, to avoid going through users()

	minimum amount of shares for each member is now [ player level - 4 ]
 	maximum amount of shares is still [ player level ]
		what  this does is  make the exp distribution related to who is doing the work.
		no longer will a level 19 be able to have the same shares as a level 4
		this promotes partying of players of similar levels and slows down newbie progression

	Kids can be added to a party
	Kids cannot pick up the party  object or become party  leaders.

	A  player sees how many exp the party gets and how  many they get individually after  each kill

	A  party member no longer needs to  be in the same room as the leader to get experience.
                   	They do however need to be in the room with the monster at the time it dies.  
		There is no remote exp gained.
	A member does need to be in the same room as another party member to get a share of their  exp.

	There is now a mud wide party who list.
	Any player in a party can see all parties and members on nirvana by typing 'party who'
	Any wizard who want access, can add this line in a function 
		   "/players/beck/PartyMaster.c"->PartyWho();

		This list only shows each party and its members...no additional stats are given.

	Maximum number of members in a party is 6 including, kids  (same as before)

	All other features and commands are the same.  except  'party status'  is now just 'party'.
