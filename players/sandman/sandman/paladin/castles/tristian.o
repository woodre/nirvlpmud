Youthen turn to notice the large tapestries on the walls. The one directlybehind the chair, located on the raised dias, catches your eye.  Uponcloser inspection you can see its a picture of Tristian, the Hand of thePaladins, mounted on a Huge Platinum Dragon leading the masses of theguild into battle against the evils of the land.  The paige announces you and you step forward to present yourself to The Lord of the Castle and His Bueatiful wife.  You are impressed at the way they carry themselves, Tristian in his gleaming mithril armour and Autumn in her shimmering silver gown with long auburn tresses. You decide that you dont want to waste time and step right up to present your case to the Lord and Lady of the Castle."
