   The dark cloaked figure then spoke as if relating a dream. "It will come
to pass that another of your bretheren wilt journey to the lost city. There
he must obtain the cursed sword that didst spill your blood, and destroy it
in the fire of nir-pa." The armored figure then drew his sword and continued,
"Once this is done, i shall give this warrior mine own blade to avenge thee
my son, and he shall contest with Azrah herself." Then the pale figures eyes
flashed a smoldering crimson and pronounced, "And then shalt Azrah be slain.
for none may stand against mine design."


So was recorded the dream of our master, and loathe are we to believe it. Still
we heed these dreams as warning. The sword of Azrah is guarded by our war 
master in this our seat of strength. The fire of nir-pa is guarded deep in the
bowels of our pupet king's castle. Thus we ensure that this prophesy will not
be fulfilled.


Alka Kan, scribe of Azrah
