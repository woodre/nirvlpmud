              Catwoman
        May God Keep Her Soul


      Death is before me today:
      Like the recovery of a sick man,
      Like going forth into a
        garden after a sickness.

      Death is before me today:
      Like the odor of myrrh,
      Like sitting under a sail
        in a good wind.

      Death is before me today:
      Like the course of a stream,
      Like the return of a man
        from the war-galley to
        his house.

      Death is before me today:
      Like the home that a man longs to see,
      After years spent as a captive.


      -A long forgotten poem I heard in a dream,
       A mortal song that celebrates the gift.

      -When in a ghostly state, 'kneel before statue'
