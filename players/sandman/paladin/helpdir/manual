                             MANUAL OF PALADINS
                                  2.14.94


WELCOME!
The Paladins Guild is Nirvana's first and only all fighters guild.
In place of spells you recieve bonuses based on weapon proficiencies 
and combat methods.


PALADIN WEAPONS
===============
Paladins must use special weapons to get bonuses during combat.
Each weapon is given a weapon type:  sword, axe, flail, mace, lance.
These help determine how great a bonus you recieve in damages.
To see if a weapon is capable of giving you a bonus you can
use the [identify] command.  

If you are unable to find a paladin weapon you may change a normal
weapon into a limited paladin weapon by going to the forge room. You 
will recieve proficiency bonuses with the weapon, but you will not
be able to offwield it for use with the dual weapons combat method.
The weapon type of a changed weapon is always 'sword'. The changed
weapon also has '[PW]' after the short description.


PALADIN SHIELDS
===============
Paladin shields are specially designed to be used with the
Shield & Sword combat method. They allow you to deflect and
block attacks, greatly reducing damage done to you. Use the
[identify] command to see if a shield is a Paladin Shield.


WEAPON PROFICIENCY
==================
There are five different weapon types that a Paladin may
recieve proficiency in.
   
   sword     -  daggers, knives, any type of sword (long,short,bastard)
   axe       -  hand axes, battleaxes
   flail     -  flails, and any miscellaneous weapons
   lance     -  lances, spears, javelins, tridents, pikes, and weapons
                of the polearm family
   mace      -  any bludgeoning weapons (hammers,maces)

The amount of extra damage you do is based on your weapon proficiency
for the type of weapon you are using.
You can raise your weapon proficiencies in the Paladin Training Hall.


COMBAT METHODS
==============
There are four different combat methods available. Again you must
train with these methods in the Paladin Training Hall. The higher
skilled you are in the method, the more damage.

[1] STANDARD         This is used by all players in Nirvana. Each time you
                     log on your combat method is set to this. You recieve
                     only proficiency bonuses when using this method.
                 
[2] DUAL WEAPONS     Using this method enables you to use two weapons           
                     at the same time. This inflicts the most damage
                     of all the methods. To wield a second weapon you
                     can use the command [wield2] or [offwield] (paladin
                     weapons only, NOT changed weapons)
                     When employing a second weapon you cannot wear
                     a shield.
                     NOTE: if you are using a two-handed weapon, use
                           this combat method to recieve all the
                           bonuses available to you.

[3] SHIELD & SWORD   This method provides you with greater protection.
                     It allows you deflect or block your opponents attack
                     making damage done to you minimal or null.
                     NOTE: You must use paladin shields with this method

[4] MOUNTED          The mounted combat method allows you to use a
                     warhorse in combat. It will attack the target
                     you specifiy enabling you to inflict greater
                     damage. You can go to the Paladin stables to
                     learn more about the abilities of warhorses.


ADVANCING, TRAINING, PRACTICING
-------------------------------
Paladins use normal experience to advance levels. The only difference
is that the experience required for levels is higher. It takes a regular
player 2,500,000 exp to become wizard, while a Paladin must have
3,750,000. Your rate of advancement should remain the same, since
you're are much more powerful than a regular player, making the 
experience easier to aqcuire.

Training and practicing for your combat skills is done in the
Paladins Training Hall. There you may find the cost to advance your
skills to the next level. The higher the skills the better the bonuses.


What Combat Method To Use:
--------------------------
The methods that you use the most should be the Dual Weapons and
the Shield & Sword method. What advantage one has over the other
depends on alot of things: level of opponent, how many opponents,
quality of your weapons/armor and your opponents, etc...

Some recommendations:
   o The Shield & Sword method is especially helpful if you are 
     fighting a large number of monsters that are as powerful or
     more powerful than yourself. It will reduce the amount of damage
     you take from EACH monster that hits you. 
   o Using the Dual Weapons method greatly increases the damage
     you inflict on your opponents. Use this on large amounts of
     weak monsters, or on small numbers of strong opponents.
   o The Mounted combat method is used with the warhorse to do
     mounted attacks. It can best be considered to be between the 
     above two. The horse will attack doing extra damage, plus 
     the monsters will attack the warhorse taking some of the damage
     away from you.

The only way you can find out which suits you best is by experimenting   
with them all. You can use the training rooms to the north to practice
with the different methods.
