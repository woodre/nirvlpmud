[===========================================================================]

Paladins are highly skilled fighters.  As such they can recieve training
in many different types of combat methods.

At this point there are four different types of combat methods available:
Standard, Mounted, Shield & Sword, and Dual Weapons.

Each differs in the advantages and bonuses you recieve while employing
them.  You can make your own decision as to which suits you best.
The more experienced you become with them the more knowledge you
will have of which method is best used in a given situation.

All but the Standard combat method requires that you train to gain
prowess.  The better you're trained the more powerful you become.

For a listing of the available combat methods and a description
