[==========================================================================]

To raise your weapon proficiency and combat modifiers you must train.
Training is done in the Paladin Advancement Hall.
Cost for raising your skills
depends on the level of your modifiers and whether it is a weapon
or combat modifier.  You can type 'cost' in the Advancement Guild
to see how much it costs to raise your modifiers by one.
