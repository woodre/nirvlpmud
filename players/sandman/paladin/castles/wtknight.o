long_desc "You are amazed at the height of the ceilings as you enter the castle. Thehigh ceilings give the castle a feeling of openess.  The downstairs areahas beautiful marble floors.  There is large fireplace against one of thewalls that is surrounded by chairs.  It looks like a place friends get together to talk on a chilly night, by a warm fire.  Beautiful tapestrieshang from every wall.  A marble staircase ascends from the middle of theroom, leading to the many rooms upstairs.PLACES: you can get to from here are "church" and "shop"."
outer_desc "The Castle of the White Knight and Lady Akasha is an impressive sight.The castle is a heavily fortified structure made of large dark grey stones.You can see holes for the archers looking down on you menacingly.  Thereis a large moat surrounding the outer walls and large iron gate barringentrance to the castle."
grounds_desc "Through a massive stone arch covered in ivy you see a beautiful courtyardfrequented by Wtknight and Lady Akasha.  It is hedged by fragrant whiteenglish roses.  The trickle of the statuary fountain has a serene effecton all who enter here.You may "enter" the castle or "look at castle"."
