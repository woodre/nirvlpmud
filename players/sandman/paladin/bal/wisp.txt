How it works:
	The wisp works with command interception. The wisp follows the
	leader (moves to the same room), intercepting his/hers commands.
	An intercepted command starts a call_out in the wisp, which will
	be executed immediately after all heart beats.
	If the leader has moved, the follower will be commanded to
	the very last command, the leader did before moving.
	The wisp is moved to the leader in the call_out'ed function.
	
Advocacies:
	Simplicity is good :-)
	Follower imitates the leader, rather than just teleporting around.
	Manages all nonstandard exits. Follower can even 'goportal' to
	catch up.
	Follower can't keep up with sprinting or fast typing players.
	(only one move per heart beat)
	Prevents the follower from going where he shouldn't be able to go.

Drawbacks:
	Follower can't keep up with sprinting or fast typing players.
	Very remote chance that follower will imitate a non-move command.
	(does it exist?)

Conclusion:
	Slow follow is probably not wanted by the players. Makes sense
	to be slow at tracking though...
