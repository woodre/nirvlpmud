   Paladins are based on the basic AD&D paladin character class. The main scope
of thier powers lay in thier battle training, combined with limited healing
and non offensive spells. In this guild they pay an inflated level cost to 
gain levels, along with a price in gold for each combat skill they train a level
in. (see the files 'levels' and 'skills' for more on the cost).
