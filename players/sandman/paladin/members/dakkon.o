loginmsg "Blackblade walks over the hill absorbing mana and getting stonger by the minute. Fear not allies of good, evil shall tremble to the ever growing strength of my fury."
logoutmsg "Blackblade walks back over the hill with his head hung low and sword arm hanging limply to his side, he is gone but not beaten for the pendulem of good and evil continues its steady swinging. He would stay but the land is drained of its mana and he is bone tired. But fear thee not he shall return one day."
