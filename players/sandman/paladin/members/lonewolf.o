loginmsg "appears from the darkness and draws his swords.  You hear growling and see pairs of red glowing eyes appear behind him.  He growls low and gutterally, and the growling ceases and the glowing eyes fade.  Lonewolf looks up and grins evilly, then goes about his business."
logoutmsg "sheaths his swords and fades into the darkness.  In the distance, you hear wolves howling, welcoming their brother back home."
