loginmsg "strides from out of the mists as he enters the realm of Nirvana.  His everyday clothing mystically transforming to the garb of the era.  A runic sword appears out of the air and flyies to his hand.  He looks at the sword for a moment and then sheathes it at his side.  He steps into his beloved guildhall, nodding to his friends.  Palin speaks: 'Greetings Comrades!!'"
logoutmsg "sighs deeply as he once again must leave his beloved guildhall and valued companions.  He turns his back on Nirvana and strides boldly toward the great mists.  Palin draws forth his runic blade from his side and casts iit into the mists from whence it came.  Two steps into the mist and his courtly garb transforms into the mundane trappings of the real world.  Fear  not for he shall return to aid the innocent and bring justice to hthe wicked."
