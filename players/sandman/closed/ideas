(Grimm here ;)
Okey, ya asked for a few ideas for projects and stuff online :)
here's a quicky list of mine  (more to come if ya need it)

-- Multiple guests.  If guest is already on, allow a person to log in as
        guest2, then guest3, etc
-- a secondary password for wizards ("wizword" -- already have the tested
        code for it)
-- a command "findallob" (currently in "/players/scooter/closed/wand.c")
        that shows a list of ALL items currently being carried around
        by any player that was created by a given wiz, and lists the
        filename of it
-- quest levels for lvl 5, 10, and 15, and possibly for exlvl 5, 10, 15
        (I've already started on this project)
-- new command "prevsnoop" that basically just returns a list of the past
        20 commands the player has typed (easy, just show the history list
        from the quicktyper)
-- new money system with gold, silver, copper, etc
-- a bank that the players can use to deposit coins (charges interest, etc)
-- a language system for tells, writes, says, etc basically can be just a list
        that is checked from the master catch_tell (not sure of the location
        of it tho)
-- color online...use a flag in the player.c or use a filter system in the
        master catch_tell to weed out the escape characters
-- mftp...allows uploads and downloads via ftp directly to and from the mud
        (limit to downloads only for wizzies lvl <100 or so to prevent people
        from overloading the HD) -- current source is located on
        abdallah.cd.chalmers.se under /pub/lpmud/mftp
-- hunger system...where the players have to eat to survive...can be based so
        that higher leveled players need to eat more than lower leveled
        players -- if ya don't eat, ya get damage from being hungry
-- weather in the rooms...can be based off of seasons with snow, rain, hail,
        etc
-- mudtime (already coded in "/players/grimm/mtime.c") to allow day/night,
        seasons, mud years, mud months -- is based off of real time where
        1 mud minute = 5 real seconds, 60 mud seconds in a mud min, 60 mud
        mins in a mud hour, 24 mud hours in a mud day (which equates to 2
        real hours, 1 hour day, 1 hour night), 9 mud days in a mud week,
        4 mud weeks in a mud month, 10 mud months in a mud year (the mud year
        equates to right at 1 mud year per real month)
-- armor rot...can have like 100*ac "hp" for armor or so, also with the weather,
        the armor can rust and rot away
-- an additional strength adjustment that is a + to damage (non-buyable) where
        for every 10000 hp damage the player does they get a +1 to their damage
        (up to a +5) (turns out to be really hard to get the +5, but is good
        incentive for the players)
-- a new command for players "fixweight" that scans through their stuffs and
        adjusts their weight
-- a "censor" to detect foul language on the shout, etc lines (under FCC rules
        so kinda have to enforce it (got high school students online too ya
        know))
-- timeouts for players...after 20 mins of being idle, they begin getting
        messages and after 30 mins of idle time they get moved to the shop,
        get forced to sell all, and then "die of boredom" (forced to quit)
-- option for wizards to be sent automatically to their workrooms upon
        login (to escape from those damn enter watchers that tell any wiz
        (i.e. Death) when a person (or wiz) logs in)
-- "earplugs" to block tells so wizzies (like lvl 50+) cant be bothered
        by lower leveld people's tells
-- "isolation" for lvl 100+...go into "isolation" so you can't be bothered,
        where you are not found as living, nor found in the users()
        function ;)    ('cept by higher lvl peoples, of course)
-- races w/ advantages and disabilities for each
-- "unique items"...where there will only be >1< of the item on the game
        at any single time, and where they cannot be stored in like the
        lockers (check out "/players/grimm/rooms/haphaz_k12d2.c" and the
        item "/players/grimm/weapons/shadow.c"...if you drop the shadow,
        it resets the room and moves the shadow onto the titan in the room,
        NOTE: normal resets DO NOT put the shadow on the titan ;)
-- set up a "destruct_ok()" function to possibly aid in the above unique items
        deal
-- fix game "tell" where if the teller is invis and a lesser level than the
        tellee, the tellee will see the teller's real name instead of the
        current "Someone tells you:" deal (see the "tell(str)" function in
        "/players/grimm/closed/obj/bone.c")
-- new command "ul" that loads and updates an item in one command (put in
        player.c:        static update_load(str) {
                                     load(str);
                                     update_object(str);
                                     return 1; }
        (has been tested already to work and is also in 
        "/players/scooter/closed/wand.c")
-- have "scars" put on a player for whenever they die (already coded and checked
        out on a load of different systems)
-- stricter constraints and punishments for newbies under lvl 40
-- have "objectives" or "tasks" for wizzies to do to gain levels:
        for lvl 21 to get to 25:  open a few rooms in an area
         "   "  25 "  "   "  30:  show at least SOME intelligence in coding
         "   "  30 "  "   "  40:  the wiz should write up a man page to further
                                      develop our /doc section
        etc.

okey :)  that enuf for ya for now?   ;)
