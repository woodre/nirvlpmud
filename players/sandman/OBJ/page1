     It was on the day of the death of the prophet at the hands of our lord
Azrah that the chief of our priests began to have the visions. Here we have
recorded them, and it is our hope that we can find a way to make sure these
prophesies never come to pass.

So spoke the Head Priest, Altana de Po Ni, in the year of the shepard:

     I saw what could only be the hated prophet, though I saw his death with
mine own eyes. He knelt before two figures. One ghostly pale in dark rainment.
Upon his shoulder a raven sat unblinking. The second figure, a shinning warrior
adorned with the same silver armor as the prophet and a mighty sword at his 
side. The prophet hung his head and said he had failed. The people of Meddena
were still enslaved. The pale figure touched the prophet's brow and his wounds
dissappeared. The armored figure spoke, "You have not failed, all occurs as
we have weaved it."
