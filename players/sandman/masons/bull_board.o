tmp_text "I'm sniffling as I write this...the Masons were my first guild.This guild is the best in Nirvana.  Cleanest code too, I'm told.We somehow attracted the nicest people on Nir...more power to us!Deus, Sniv, Bama, Azeem--you aren't forgotten.1991.June.I was made a Freemason at Nirvana. (Elias Ashmole, revised)I hope you're not still ticked off at me, Sandman. *grin*"We have the Mason word, and second sight"--Henry Adamson of PerthDream on, dream on, dream on...as only Masons can :)You did this to me on purpose, Molasar...put back your castle!				Farewell, brothers and sisters:				    ------>Ephraim HawkwindLast Mason on the mud wins!!The builder of the Temple is not forgotten.**I have liked the Masons the short time I have been a member,and I do think we have had some interesting folks here.(That would include you Ahz and maybe me...nah.)  But it didneed a bit of a rewrite to keep up.  Of course the power levelsof the dopps and such made it look worse than it was.  I startfeeling like 3-kings around here when there is so much guildpower.  	Anyway, so now my second guild dies and I can choose...???I can hope Sandy gets that new-code done in time, if not I guessI can see if the nomads or the Vamps need some help.  Not that Ireally need a guild anymore, I just like having the tricks.  Ifyou could loan me the code though I would appreciate it.  I am tryingto code one on Angalon and I am clueless on the simplest aspects.  *sigh*		Have fun all.			Halcon**It's too bad this guild is shutting down...this was my first guild when Ihad started playing, and I was hoping that it would be my last...  Anyhow,I understand the situation you're in, Molasar, and hope to see my friendsin wherever it will lead us now.  *hugs to all***I feel rather alone around here, Nirvana is filled with wampires, and all they dois fooling around exposing their big nasty pointy teeth (eek!). If anybody wannaknow I've joined this guild twice now. Some one and a half years ago I reachedlevel 16 (i think), but had to stop muddin'. Around a month ago I started againfrom scratch, and naturally i joined the same guild, only to see that it wasquite secluded.And then the messages about closing the guild down started pouring in, but itseemed inevitable - a guild with only a couple of member aren't really justified.All I can say, is that I really enjoyed my time in the Guild; the aristocraticguild ranks, the cool guild members, the whole feel of the guild, etc.Well, things move on... See you around fellas!**I initially planned to remain a Mason until the end of this guild. Themud has changed greatly since I first dream-whacked critters, though,(like Demoder closing up 4 a while, Malikto's treasure-hoard gone,weapon breaking added, and now high heal prices).  I love the Masons.  I can't hack'n'slash effectively as one, alas,which was the reason Azrael was made.  My recent death has made theacquisition of dream a long and arduous process, by which time we willbe no more.  Farewell, brothers and sisters. Vale atque vale.Molasar, thanks 4 being around lately! U made the closing much easier 2 take!See U all in the new guild! Beauseant!  Masons 4ever!Shamefacedly, Ephraim/Azrael.**even if everyone else seems to be wimping out, i'm a mason til theyclose!!!!! (of course, considering how often i've been on latelythat isn't that hard for me to do, but.......)*HUGS* to everyone that is left...and sandman? *blinkblinkblinkblink* to you!!!!!!Talijen the BouncyGiggley One**yes, its me again - the tiny mason. I'd like to know what happens when the guild close,especially these points:- if you are a member still, will you loose the infamous sixth of your total xp?- do the guild masters want us to leave before closing the guild?- wouldn't it be crap if everybody just left to join the monks? (it reminds me of a bunch of  kids on a fairground, or something like that...)- whatsallthis about a new guild, instead of the masons. Please elaborate.- did you know that the monks are running an internal dispute, about being too powerful  Things seems to be running out of hand round here!That's all for now. What's that snoring I hear?     later mon. Yours The Walking Questionmark Balowski (hoping to see some response soon).**The Masons will close when the new guild is up (see next note)this will be awhile off, there's still alot to do.The Masons are over 2 yrs old and have had little modification sincethen and it's just not competitive anymore.  I'm interested in doingsomething new instead of revamping this code.To answer some of Balowski's questions:-You won't have to leave before closing, you won't lose any experience,and I'll see about returning the experience used to buy ranks.  I'llhave to check w/the Gods but I don't think there should be a problem.The monks are new so they're gonna generate alot of interest, oncethe newness wears off and new guilds worked on by other wizzes areput up they should stabilize.  It is very hard to have a guilds powers/costs even out.  They onlyway is to put it up and go from there.  Naturally it will cause aruckus in the beginning but they should even out over time.molasar**Deathmonger, Sandman, and I are working on a new guild called the Paladins.  It will basically be a fighters guild.  Members willnot be allowed to use any spells, but will instead be givenweapon proficiencies and different combat methods to aid themin battle. More news to come as it occursmolasr**This is just an idea, but what about some kinda smithy where youcan get your weapons fixed good, not only a repair of broken weapons?It would be great in a fighters guild to have something like that.Btw. isn't it good to see some messages on the board?
