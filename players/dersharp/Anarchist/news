*       From the beginning of time and space the forces of Good and Evil     *
*  have fought their eternal battle.                                         *
*                                                                            *
*	Lo!  It came to be that the heavens brought forth their champions to *
*  battle the spawn of the hells.  Among these champions were the mighty     *
*  Clerics and powerful Masons.  They scoured the planes destroying the      *
*  temples of Evil and freeing the throngs of people formerly enslaved by    *
*  the evil demons.  In time these deeds and many more were brought to the   *
*  attention of the Dukes of Hell.                                           *
*                                                                            *
*       The denizens of the hells looked upon the deeds of the forces of GOOD*
*  with great trepidation.  They cried aloud to their sovereign lords about  *
*  these deeds that threatened their very existence.  The foremost of the    *
*  Dukes of Hell, Asmodeus decreed that he would create a most unholy sect to*
*  fight the forces of Good.  Only the creatures of the blackest hearts      *
*  could join and use his powers.  In time these worshippers of the everdark *
*  were given a name.........................................................*
*  .........................................ANARCHISTS!!!                    *
