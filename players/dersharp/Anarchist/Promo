        This WILL be the home of the Dark Anarchist Sect.  Anarchists
  are the epitome of evil.  Whenever they can they are said to take the
  lives of the innocent and weak.  If one were to strive for the powers
  of eternal dark, you would find the way strife with perils.  Only the
  most evil are allowed to harness the full power of the hells.  Including
  in the powers are the ones listed below......

     Haven                    Create your own little world
     Blink                    Dodge your opponent's blows by disappearing
     Leech                    Hit an opponent and heal from the blow
     Anarchy                  Extreme area-attack spell, hard to control
