                        Welcome to Delnoch

     Thank you for stopping in, and also for taking the time to read
this sign.  There have been a few changes as of Feb. 2000.
The biggest right now is in the Arena.  Now each player may
summon 6 gladiators.  Check it out.

    Delnoch tries to tell a story.  To understand it you must 'look' at
things and listen to what the characters have to say.  Nearly everything
here can be 'look'ed at.

    Suggestions are welcome, but remember I am trying to stick to a
story line here.  Thanks.......
