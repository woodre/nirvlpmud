                        Welcome to Delnoch

     Thank you for stopping in, and also for taking the time to read
this sign.  This area is growing, and has recently undergone many
changes.  The most noticable of these is the addition of color.  If you
like the color, or if you don't, I'd like to hear from you.

    Delnoch tries to tell a story.  To understand it you must 'look' at
things and listen to what the characters have to say.  Nearly everything
here can be 'look'ed at.  Eventually I hope to have a quest here, the
clues will be in the descriptions and the 'chat' from the monsters.

    When complete, Delnoch will consist of the Town, the Keep, the Forest,
the Mountains, and the Plains.  I hope to have all of this completed by
the time school starts again in September.  Some of it will be added
a bit at a time during the summer.

    Suggestions are welcome, but remember I am trying to stick to a
story line here.  Thanks.......
