Files used in the forest:
/players/traff/delnoch/forest/
  forest1.c - forest11.c
/players/traff/delnoch/mon/
  make_fc0 - make_fc9

forest1 is the entry to the forest.  It is adjacent to Delnoch.
It will have a sign giving information and warnings about
the forest.  (I may also put in a 'Ranger Station', haven't
decided on that yet.
forest2.c - forest11.c are the forest rooms.  The exits are labeled
North, South, East and West, but in reality all moves by
these commands will be random moves to another forest room.
Players who search can find a PATH leading downhill to
Delnoch, or a TRAIL leading uphill to the mountains.
PATH and TRAIL will NOT be found in the same room and until
they learn the destinations players will not know where they
lead.
Also, players level 5 and below can use the FLEE command
which will return them to the forest entrance.

The monster files, make_fc0 - make_fc9 use the method outlined
in /open/CODING/monster3 and monster3.exp.  One reason I am
using this method is that it is supposed to save memory.  As
I am planning on having the forest well populated I thought
that would be good.  More on that later.  The room files
will call the make_fc[n] files to make the monsters.
Certain player or monster actions will cause monsters to move
to different rooms, giving a lifelike forest look, I hope!
Originally I had planned on using regular monsters, each with
random moves coded in.  However, on thinking about it, if a
player came in and caused the monsters to be created and then
left all those monsters running around calling out to random
move would be wasted, and a needless drain on the processer.
I think I will be able to create nearly the same look,
without using any callouts at all.
