     The Delnoch Forest lies between the town of Delnoch and the Skoda
Mountains.  The forest covers a vast area and many people lose their
sense of direction, and become lost.  Here are some things you should
know:

                    !!! WARNINGS !!!

1. The forest is dangerous.
2. It is a NO TELEPORT area.  Once you go in you will have to find your
   own way out.
3. Our entire Search and Rescue team has gone to the Swiss Alps for
   training, so don't expect them to find you.
4. We do NOT encourage newbies and/or low level palyers to enter
   the forest.  All persons enter at their own risk.
5. Finally, Please don't feed the bears!
