/*  ARENA.C - The arena in Delnoch is a place where players of any level
    may come and summon monsters to fight.  There is a limit of 6
    monsters which may be summoned /monster class/reset.
    Monsters levels are set
    with a random factor to be in a range that is near the level of the
    player who rings the 'gong'.
    Changes as of 5-30-96:
    Color added, paths changed to fit new directory structure.
    1-29-00
    Added notes to help clarify monster selection.
    2-1-00
    Removed int GONG and added int one, two, three, four; to keep
    track of monsters summoned rather than number of times 'gong'
    was rung.
