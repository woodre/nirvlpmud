Subject: forest critters
Give message.  Finish message with '**', or '~q' to cancel
]In the area I'm working on there are 10 forest critters ranging in
]level from 8-17.  The critters are quite mobile.  They are cloned
]1 at a time when a player leaves a room, currently 10 rooms.  After
]they are cloned the critters are moved with command("north").  Since
]movement in this area is random, that should provide a fairly even
]distribution.  Also, if a player encounters multiple critters in a
]room, when one is killed some or all of the others will leave the 
]room.  That should further even out the distribution, and ensure that
]players cannot stand in one room and kill many critters.  Sometimes
]they might be able to get 2 in one room, I would say it would be very
]rare that they get 3, unless other players are moving in the area.
]Also keep in mind that critters are randomly wimpy, adding to the 
]random movement.  A player chasing a wimpy monster could end up in
]a room with several "fresh" and aggresive critters.
]
]It is the number of critters I wanted to discuss here.  For testing
]the limiting number has been set pretty high.  I have 'write_file'
]statements in the rooms and the critters so I can track critters
]cloned and critters killed.  This will allow for easy adjustment when
]the area is put into play.  In a test this evening, Fakir ran a
]test char. through the area.  The test char. was a level 19 Dervish,
]using 2 wc 18 weaps.  The test lasted about 21 min.  Probably much
]faster than a player entering the area for the first time would take.
]A total of 43 critters were cloned and 20 were killed.  I haven't
]broken down the numbers by critter levels, but a rough glance looked
]as if they were random, as they should be.  After the test I went 
]through and dested the remaining critters and found this distribution.
]1 room had 7 critters
]3 rooms had 4 critters
]4 rooms had 1 critter each.
]Not sure why the one room ended up with so many.  It will take some
]more testing to see if things even out.  Anyway, my main concern at
]the moment is the number of critters.  Without a fair amount of them
]the area won't be as dangerous as I would like.  I realize there must
]be some limits though, so I hope you can give me some guidance here.  I'm not s
]just what might be acceptable.  If you want to take a text char.
]through the area it starts in ~/delnoch/forest/forest2.c
]Clones and kills are recorden in the file ~/delnoch/forest/CRITTERS
]I plan to seperate that into 2 files for easier reading.***

ACK!  I wasn't up to typing that all in again, so I am sending it to your
email address.  Sorry it was so long, but I felt a full explanation was
needed.  As usual there is no rush on this as I have a good bit of work
left to do.  Critters will NOT carry swords and trinkets when I am done!
*GRIN*  Thanks.
