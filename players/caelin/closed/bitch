with all this pain inside.. i have feelings, that i just cannot hide..
and Im dealing, with most of them tonight i think i'll be alright.. if i just keep trying.. i know I'll be alright.. once i stop crying, but i'm thinking of you each night and day and nothing seems to take this pain away. Im dying for you now, more than ever.. i think of yesterday, when we swore forever and all those happy

times, we shared together. How could you forget, all those feelings.. youve made it very clear, but Im not willing.. or even trying to hear, this shit youre selling.. even if its true, i need  more time to get over you so I can do what I have to do..

even if its something scary and new. Ill just say goodbye.. and try not to wonder, of all the reasons why, my heart was plundered. I have to move on and show my girls  Im still strong and Ill keep fighting their whole life long to be by them like I have been since the day they were born.
