So break down and dance
In the flame of your lives
And whisper your secrets
To the children with knives
We all know what happens
When we lay down and die
Our parents will suffer
Our babies will cry
So ravish the women
And shout to the sky
That the kingdom is coming
The kingdom of lies
Where all men are equal
Since nobody tries
And Silence is golden
It severs all ties.
