To my people the melding of lives is the penultimate experience of human existance.  We don't have marriage the way that you think of marriage because we place greater importance on each person's individual journey and growth.  Traditionally, two or more people who have chosen to share their lives with one another express this by engaging in a ceremony similar to the historical handfasting.  While the actual vows and format vary, there are certain standard points.  This handfasting lasts for one year and one day.  By participating, you are committing to fully share your life, your being, your very existance with your partner for that time.  There is no divorce, there is no breaking of this contract.  You agree that for one year you will do your ultimate best to make both partners happy, healthy people.  On the 1 year anniversary, either partner may choose to end the contract for any reason...not going into this though...it won't be a problem for us.
