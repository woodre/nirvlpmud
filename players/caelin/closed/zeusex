The girl just asked me if I was going to post.  Since I masturbated twice this morning I haven't given much thought to sex.  Rather, I hadn't until the girl sent me descriptions of the nine different types of master/slave relationships.  She claims to be a combination of True Submissive Non-Slave and True Submissive Play Slave.
I can neither agree nor disagree because we have yet to explore that within the boundaries of our relationship.  I can say that it's not something I am very familiar with or even naturally comfortable with.  The girl was very happy about two bruises I left on her shoulder though; positive reinforcement at work.

Historically my sex life has always been fairly vanilla, rather democratic in nature, and generally centered around making my partner happy first and foremost.  I derive far more personal satisfaction from eating a woman out than having sex with her, primarily because I have almost always been able to make a woman come with my tongue whereas I've had much more mixed results with my cock.  
 On top of that, when I make a girl come from eating her out, I can still play with her and continue the fun if we want.  Typically after I come I am out of commission for at least 20 or 30 minutes, if not more, which is okay if she came too, but if she doesn't then I am not as happy no matter how good she tells me it felt.

My sexual relationship with the girl is still fairly vanilla at this point, but we are a long way off from where we envision our sex life will be in the future, and I'm not just talking about polyamory.  While our relationship has gone through quite a lot in the past month, our sex life is still in its early stages of development. 
  Sometimes I think our sex life might also be too democratic, primarily because of our naivety regarding the others desires and our mutual inclination towards pleasing our partner.  We're also worried about overstepping boundaries.  One of us has to take charge.
