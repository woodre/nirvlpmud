She said Ive decided that were headed nowhere. And she said I think you need to be going somewhere. Then she said that place is out there without her, she wants me to just move on somewhere. And she said that place will never be with her. And I said but we were headed somewhere. Then I said that place would be nowhere without them. Then she said that wed never even get there.

And I said I cant live this life without them. Then she said, well they wont even miss you. And she said well be doing better off without you. And I said, now youll just be killing me too slowly. Then I said, cant you see that they wont even get a chance to know me? And she said that theyll be better off without you here. And now Im like the living dead, or maybe its that Im just still

dying. Nah I think Im already dead, like a corpse that lives on after dying, still drowning in the tears it was crying. Their voices are always echoing around in my head. The days pass by without me even knowing. And when I cry my tears are never really showing.
Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
Theyre inside, with the crushed dreams of a future that were blowing. And now I am drowning in those tears that cant be seen flowing. I cant even draw breath without this pain inside constantly growing. I just want to die, Ill never get a chance to always have them at my side. But god why? 
Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
Why couldnt I just stay closer to all of them? Those two little girls and their Daddy they wont get a chance of knowing. Oh god why? Now Ill never get to see them as theyre growing. It hurts too bad inside, more than they anyone who sees me could be knowing. 
Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
And how Ive tried, only to end up with this heavy heartache that Im towing. But oh god why? Why did I have to do it all wrong? I need to know why, so maybe I can find an end to this sappy sad song. Its been days, wandering in confusion, with sleep gone entirely far too

long. And its all her lies that are still eating away at my insides. And I really do think Im just going to die, without my babies ever knowing. Or hearing just how or why, our families love and hugs stopped glowing. Then she said, Its all the things that we said in the past, thats left us with no good reasons. And I said I always thought our daughters were the best of reasons

And now I cry, watching the passing of each changing season. And my heart cries, screaming of some kind of bloody treason. Oh god please help me, help me find a way to see them. And make it soon before they forget him. You know that guy, the one who would always rock while hed hold and sing to them.
Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
All those songs, will they ever really remember? Im praying now that they will, from January all the way through to December. Oh please god, try and help them remember, my love for them was never even a question. My happy days, they gave me all the best of them. And when I die, 
Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
let them know Id never stopped loving them. And I would have stayed, if shed only have been willing to keep trying. Not for her love or her rare attempts at affection. Just for my little girls, because living without them feels more like dying.
