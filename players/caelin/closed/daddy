Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
creeping are the demons, in every dark corner of her room
closing her eyes so not to see them, for surely they spell out her doom
the grandfather just struck three, a few more hours until sunshine
each second seems an eternity, so she hums melodies to help pass the time 
all the songs her daddy would sing her, when she was but a little baby girl

Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
as hed rub her back until shed purr, she loved him more than the world
and how those days did fly past, only now to feel so scared and alone
remembering when they spoke last, a few sweet words over the telephone
his loss was one she couldnt afford, it left her heart broken and scared

Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
after he died life seemed so hard, with a great sorrow she couldnt share 
by an evil world shed been consumed, once just an innocent gullible soul  
she never realized how darkness loomed, and how it would one day take its toll
 her step fathers ways were wicked, such a tainted and dark, evil man
Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
life on the run was her only ticket, to find a happier life was her only plan
the road she found showed no mercy, a pretty girl lost and out on her own
in a blink of an eye she was thirty, with no place that she could call home
 from bad jobs to abusive boyfriends, she pushed on as each day grew harder
Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
withstanding all each day could send, a year later she gave birth to a daughter
the fathers name was never known, just a guy shed met drunk at some party
before she knew it years had flown, looking in the mirror her face seemed forty
her little girl was her sunshine, shed sang her all those same old sweet songs
then one day she stepped over a line, and was hit by a bus over sixty feet long
Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
a mothers scream couldnt find its escape, as her world crumbled from the inside
the nightmare of life had taken its shape, everyone shed ever loved had died
now in her bedroom she stays hiding, and every shadow makes her scream
deep inside her heart lays dying, praying to somehow awake from a bad dream
back into her daddys strong arms, where she knew she was safe and sound

Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
 back to the days when life seemed warm and she had both feet on the ground
the dream has only one way of ending, there was only one type of easy way out
and her heart had no way of mending, life stole everything shed cared about
and now creeping are those demons, in every dark corner of her room
her life has lost all of its good reasons, shell make her pain fade away soon
