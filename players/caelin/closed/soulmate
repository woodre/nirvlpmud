If you were mine, Id wrap you up in blankets every time you got cold.
If you were mine, Id love you forever, even when you grew grey and old.
If you were mine, Id never waste one second by ignoring you.
If you were mine, Id spend all of eternity simply adoring you.
If you were mine, Id protect you from the cruelties in this world.

If you were mine, Id remind you each day why you decided to be my girl.
If you were mine, Id hold your hand whenever you got scared.
If you were mine, youd know in your heart that Id always be there.
If you were mine, Id make all of your cold and lonely nights warm.

Stunner #1 Super  - Josh says:
If you were mine, Id hold onto you forever with gentle caring arms.
If you were mine, Id never look down or try and judge you.
If you were mine,  Id accept you and all the things you love to do.
