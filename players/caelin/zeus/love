Love means always wanting the other person to be as happy as possible.
Love means living for the next time you can make them smile.
Love means sacrificing and compromising.
Love means promises that you'll actually keep.

But love means loving myself too.
And knowing just how much I can really take.
Love means not letting you push past my boundaries.
And not letting you hurt me so much we both break.

Love means knowing when enough is enough
And sometimes it's about having to say goodbye
My love for you means wanting to be with you every second
But being willing to walk away if you need it.

Love is about two individuals coming together
Love isn't about right and wrong
Love is about being partners
Love is about making two party into one whole.

I so much more than love you.
