Now Cass, about Mr. Wonderful.....
Cassandra - BrOkEn! says:
Yeah?
Kevin The Destroyer says:
He's a nice guy, I like him. Just one thing I was wondering about...
Cassandra - BrOkEn! says:
otay  
Kevin The Destroyer says:
Uhmmm... Why are you dating a Type A Beta with few similar interests to you?
Cassandra - BrOkEn! says:
okay a) we actually have quite a few similar interests
Cassandra - BrOkEn! says:
We share in most things in one another's lives
Cassandra - BrOkEn! says:
and b) He's not quite as dominant as I might have pictured myself with
Cassandra - BrOkEn! says:
But he's not submissive to me
Cassandra - BrOkEn! says:
And I"m not sure a constant power struggle is what I want out of life
