Note to all wizards who might be perusing my files:
I have outright stolen/thieved/absconded with copious quantities of code. 
Since the majority of that code comes from Vertebraker, I got tired of 
putting his name in every file.  Unless I say otherwise in a file, I probably
stole anything really cool from Verte.
