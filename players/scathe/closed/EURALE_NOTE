     I am in the process of updating quests so old cheat sheets do not work.
I have made the following changes to your area just to move things about and
make the players take a fresh look for your quest monsters.
  cavex:  took out the east exit
  cavex1:  removed the south exit to macha
  caved2:  made draks block north movement
  caved3:  made draks block north movement, added north exit to Macha room
  cavex3:  changed macha exit to south into caved3
  cavexdem:  took rod off demon and 'hid' it in room, added south exit to cavex4
  caved10:  added west exit and made monsters block that way to cave13
  caved12:  changed east exit to caved14
  cavex4:  added a north exit to cavexdem and made monster block
  monk20:  hid the rod part in the garden but you must kill monk first

The players still have to find all the pieces and assemble them but they'll have
to look for them now.
