The drunken device was created to add some semblence of atmosphere to this
god-forsaken mud.  What it does is to slur your speech on a variety of channels
if you are intoxicated.  It autoloads, so once you have obtained one from the
dispenser, you will not need another one.
The device automatically patches the commands say, tell, and all of the standard
channels, such as gossip, shout, etc.  However, it does not patch guild channels
but it does have a method whereby you can easily add this patch yourself.  Theway to add your own guild patch is as follows:
I have included a command in the drunken device which ought to be able to patch
any other mud command, allowing you to slur the arguments to any other command
that has been written.  This command is ddo.  Use it like this:
If you have a guild command {gt}, then to automatically slur your speech on the
guild channel, type "alias dgt ddo '{gt}'"
do not type the "", but you need to type the ''.  Replace {gt} with your guild
talk command.  From now on, typing "dgt <msg>" will send the slurred version of
<msg> over the guild channel.
