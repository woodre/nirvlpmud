ROMEO   He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
ROMEO   But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
ROMEO   It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
ROMEO   Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
ROMEO   Who is already sick and pale with grief,
ROMEO   That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
ROMEO   Be not her maid, since she is envious;
ROMEO   Her vestal livery is but sick and green
ROMEO   And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
ROMEO   It is my lady, O, it is my love!
ROMEO   O, that she knew she were!
ROMEO   She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
ROMEO   Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
ROMEO   I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
ROMEO   Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
ROMEO   Having some business, do entreat her eyes
ROMEO   To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
ROMEO   What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
ROMEO   The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
ROMEO   As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
ROMEO   Would through the airy region stream so bright
ROMEO   That birds would sing and think it were not night.
ROMEO   See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
ROMEO   O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
ROMEO   That I might touch that cheek!
JULIET  Ay me!
ROMEO   She speaks:
ROMEO   O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
ROMEO   As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
ROMEO   As is a winged messenger of heaven
ROMEO   Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
ROMEO   Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
ROMEO   When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
ROMEO   And sails upon the bosom of the air.
JULIET  O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
JULIET  Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
JULIET  Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
JULIET  And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
ROMEO   [Aside]  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
JULIET  'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
JULIET  Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
JULIET  What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
JULIET  Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
JULIET  Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
JULIET  What's in a name? that which we call a rose
JULIET  By any other name would smell as sweet;
JULIET  So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
JULIET  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
JULIET  Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
JULIET  And for that name which is no part of thee
JULIET  Take all myself.
ROMEO                     I take thee at thy word:
ROMEO   Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
ROMEO   Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
JULIET  What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
JULIET  So stumblest on my counsel?
ROMEO   By a name
ROMEO   I know not how to tell thee who I am:
ROMEO   My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
ROMEO   Because it is an enemy to thee;
ROMEO   Had I it written, I would tear the word.
JULIET  My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
JULIET  Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
JULIET  Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
ROMEO   Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
JULIET  How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
JULIET  The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
JULIET  And the place death, considering who thou art,
JULIET  If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
ROMEO   With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
ROMEO   For stony limits cannot hold love out,
ROMEO   And what love can do that dares love attempt;
ROMEO   Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
JULIET  If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
ROMEO   Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
ROMEO   Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
ROMEO   And I am proof against their enmity.
JULIET  I would not for the world they saw thee here.
ROMEO   I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
ROMEO   And but thou love me, let them find me here:
ROMEO   My life were better ended by their hate,
ROMEO   Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
JULIET  By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
ROMEO   By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
ROMEO   He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
ROMEO   I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
ROMEO   As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
ROMEO   I would adventure for such merchandise.
JULIET  Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
JULIET  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
JULIET  For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
JULIET  Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
JULIET  What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
JULIET  Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
JULIET  And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
JULIET  Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
JULIET  Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
JULIET  If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
JULIET  Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
JULIET  I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
JULIET  So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
JULIET  In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
JULIET  And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
JULIET  But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
JULIET  Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
JULIET  I should have been more strange, I must confess,
JULIET  But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
JULIET  My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
JULIET  And not impute this yielding to light love,
JULIET  Which the dark night hath so discovered.
ROMEO   Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
ROMEO   That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
JULIET  O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
JULIET  That monthly changes in her circled orb,
JULIET  Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
ROMEO   What shall I swear by?
JULIET  Do not swear at all;
JULIET  Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
JULIET  Which is the god of my idolatry,
JULIET  And I'll believe thee.
ROMEO   If my heart's dear love--
JULIET  Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
JULIET  I have no joy of this contract to-night:
JULIET  It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
JULIET  Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
JULIET  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
JULIET  This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
JULIET  May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
JULIET  Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
JULIET  Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
ROMEO   O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
JULIET  What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
ROMEO   The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
JULIET  I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
JULIET  And yet I would it were to give again.
ROMEO   Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
JULIET  But to be frank, and give it thee again.
JULIET  And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
JULIET  My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
JULIET  My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
JULIET  The more I have, for both are infinite.
JULIET  I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
JULIET  Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
JULIET  Stay but a little, I will come again.
