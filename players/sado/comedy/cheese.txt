Customer Good Morning.
Wenslydale Good morning, Sir. Welcome to the National Cheese Emporium!
Customer Ah, thank you, my good man.
Wenslydale What can I do for you, Sir?
Customer Well, I was, uh, sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through "Rogue Herrys" by Hugh Walpole, and I suddenly came over all peckish.
Wenslydale Peckish, sir?
Customer Esuriant.
Wenslydale Eh?
Customer 'Ee, Ah wor 'ungry-loike!
Wenslydale Ah, hungry!
Customer In a nutshell. And I thought to myself, "a little fermented curd will do the trick," so, I curtailed my Walpoling activites, sallied forth, and infiltrated your place of purveyance to negotiate the vending of some cheesy comestibles!
Wenslydale Come again?
Customer I want to buy some cheese.
Wenslydale Oh, I thought you were complaining about the bazouki player!
Customer Oh, heaven forbid: I am one who delights in all manifestations of the Terpsichorean muse!
Wenslydale Sorry?
Customer 'Ooo, Ah lahk a nice tuune, 'yer forced too!
Wenslydale So he can go on playing, can he?
Customer Most certainly! Now then, some cheese please, my good man.
