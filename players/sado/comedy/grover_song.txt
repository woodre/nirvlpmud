Grover Some mornings I wake up
Grover I feel so good and new
Grover I find my socks myself
Grover I put my shoes on too
Grover The feet are right, the feet are right
Grover Is it not wonderful that the feet are right?
Grover I, Grover, am big and tall
Grover and very smart and kind of cute and wonderful
Grover I think that there is nothing I cannot do
Grover You can get the feet right too.
Grover And then I go to eat
Grover The cereal is not there
Grover I see it on a shelf
Grover I climb up on a chair
Grover I get it down, I do not spill
Grover Is it not wonderful that I do not spill?
Grover I, Grover, am big and tall
Grover and very smart and kind of cute and wonderful
Grover I think that there is nothing I cannot do
Grover You can learn to not spill too.
Grover I go outside and play
Grover I bouce a ball and then
Grover I catch it right away
Grover and bounce the ball again
Grover I stretch myself up tall
Grover I reach my arms out wide
Grover I climb up trees and I go down the slide
Grover And you can do it too
Grover Yes, you and you and you
Grover Now every brand new day
Grover I get another turn
Grover In every single way
Grover Theres more for me to learn
Grover It feels so fine, Im growing up
Grover Is it not wonderful that Im growing up?
Grover Oh I, Grover, am big and tall
Grover and very smart and kind of cute and wonderful
Grover I think that there is nothing I cannot do
Grover And you and you and you
Grover are fine and growing too
Grover Yes, you are fine and growing too.
