               time period.  Takes the hit_player damage through a formula and actually
               returns 90-94% of it.  ie. if hit_player damage from opponent was 40,
               player would get hit with hit_player 36.  Effect: added ac.

               obillusion or pilluions.  Pillusion forms an illusion of a player's

dark_stalker   **NOTE** Most like illegal ***END***  I made a few changes to it but
               I still don't think it would work.  People I talked to that used to be 
               the guild thought they were great.  Right now it allows a someone that is
               maxxed in the guild to basically 'snoop' someone that is of lower level
               than themselves.  Thought about instead of 'snoop' just have it report
               the persons inventory like if you looked at them.  

ghoul          The first of two guild pets.  A ghoul is formed from a corpse of a mob.
               Ghoul's can wield weapons, wear armors, pick things up, drop things, 
               follow owners and give things they have to players.

shade          Shade is a mob in the guild hall that is used for several purposes. Guild
               members must go to shade to adv. rank within the guild, and to raise their
               magic past 30.  Guild members must also go to Shade if they wish to leave
               the guild.

shadowdragon   The Shadowdragon is the second of two guild pets. Shadowdragons can do many
               things much like the ghoul.  The dragon can't wield or wear but it can 
               pick things up and drop them.  You can mount/dismount your dragon. While
               mounted your location appears as your dragons short.  You can rename your
               dragon as well.  See 'info dragon_commands' for a full listing.

stalker        An invis mob that randomly moves about the guild hall.  If it comes across
               a player that is not a guild member it throws them to the church.
