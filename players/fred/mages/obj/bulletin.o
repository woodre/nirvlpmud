messages "Drakyr(Fred, Apr 18):**Drakyr is now in the game for those of you who are rank 5.At this moment it is a first draft and there will be things added to it as time goes.  Right now there are only two commands.Mount and dismount.  Eventually I plan on allowing you to namethem and giving them some other abilities, maybe a pouch to storethings in, added emotes, and whatnot.  If you have any problemsor questions feel free to mail me.Fred**Heh, still dominating(Bleh, Mar  6):**We're still dominating, fear fred.  BTW have I told you lately thatI get hard just thinking about logging on into a guild of Fred's?What about energizing our robes tho, and how come i'm not permanentlya deathknight, or can we have a quest to replace our organs and shitand be permanent undead?  We should have a higher progression, itdoesn't mean we need more power, just more theme....and along thoselines, how about more theme/story in general?  *WHY* are we able tomorph to liches and deathknights without actually being them?  Howabout, perhaps, quests to actually BECOME a lich, and from there, to become a deathknight?  Just random thoughts, but having recentlyunretired, I'm suddenly looking at things I was taking for grantedbefore :)Anyways, all raise wood to Fred the ferret :)-bleh the deathknight**RE: Heh, still dominating(Bleh, Mar  6)(Hellspawn, Jul  8):**I agree fully, would should have quests to have that stuff, or at least to be able to change ourregular/lich/deathknight forms at will rather than the lich and dk forms wearing off after a period of time. kinda like how the symbiotes can control it, or vampires with their wolf/mist formsf**drakyr(Tormentor, Aug  9):**I know fred has been busy with other projects, but I was wondering on if he intends on updating the drakyr at all. It says that he intends to update it and add some bells and whistles, so maybe we can get that done soon? Atleast have it so that you can dismiss the drakyr if you need to, maybe even turn its emotes on and off. A pouch would be very welcome on the drakyr. Though it would be nice if we could offer people dragon rides also. drakyr for fighting and as a pack animal, dragon for transportation, ghoul for sending objects to people. Would it be possible to make it so that if a ghoul does consume a corpse that it ups it's time till it decomposes? Also it would be nice if a ghoul could wield weapons like souleater or maybe even air since a shardak's spinal can wield air. Also I noticed that our curse spell isnt all that great, just makes the item useless, yet it can still be sold for it's regular price. If an object is cursed it should be only worth 2 coins.  Also I think that if we curse an item, that the only player it doesnt affect is the bcm that placed the curse on the item. So if I curse my weapon it will work for me, but if I die, and someone were to loot my corpse, then it would be useless to them, of course we would have to uncurse it to be able to store it. Well thats all the ideas I have at the moment...hopefully we will see some of them implimented :)Tormentor**ghoul(Diabolos, Jun 15):**ghouls can wield air.  mine does it all the time.**Drakyr(Fred, Sep 14):**A couple updates.  Info drakyr for more information.**ghoul(Fred, Jul 11):**I changed the use command on ghouls to guse since it was causing issues with other mud objects.Fred**"
