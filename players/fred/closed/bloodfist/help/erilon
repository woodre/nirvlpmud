Bloodfist Help:  Erilon the Elder

  Erilon's main purpose is to help you advance through your
levels.  Once you are ready to advance within the guild you can
seek him out and tell him you're ready to advance.  He will 
tell you what to do from there.
  Once you have defeated you're opponent in the arena you will 
also need to use Erilon to finally advance. Just 'bow' to him.
  If you decide that you would rather not be a member of the
guild, Erilon may allow you to leave_bloodfist.
