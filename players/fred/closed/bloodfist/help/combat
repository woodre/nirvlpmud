Bloodfist Help:  Combat

  Combat requires a successful balance of a number of factors.  As you
fight your endurance will drop, making you weaker.  If you are not
actively fighting, ie using attack abilities, then you will in turn
become sluggish in combat.  Third, if you are not taking enough damage
from the fight then you will be less likely to gain honor from it.  A
successful Bloodfist is able to find balance among these factors.  It
is also important to understand which duration abilities are appropriate
for which circumstances.
