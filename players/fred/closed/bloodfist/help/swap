Bloodfist Help:  Swap Weapons

  Swap allows you to quickly change weapons between the weapon you
currently have wielded any any sheathed weapon.  This can be ideal in
the heat of combat in case your weapon breaks, or if you need to switch
weapons for any reason.  The weapon you swap with will be automatically
wielded.  It is possible that you could not carry the added weight of
the new weapon, if it is heavier than your current one.  Typing 'swap'
alone will swap your current weapon with your first sheathed weapon.

Usage: swap
       swap <wep|number>
