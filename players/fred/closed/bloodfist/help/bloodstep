  Create a portal leading back to the guild hall.  Upon creating it you
will instantly be moved back to the courtyard of the guild hall.  The
portal will remain open for about a minute, allowing people to travel
through the portal to where you were.  When the creator of the portal
travels back through it, the portal will close.  This can not be done
from no-teleport (NT) rooms.
