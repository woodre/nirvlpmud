Bloodfist Help:  Endurance

  You only have a limited amount of endurance in combat.  The more
damage you take the weaker you will get.  You will both hit less
and take more damage the lower your endurance gets.  Outside of
combat your endurance will slowly regenerate.  To regenerate
more quickly use the rest ability.  Max endurance is based on
health, vigor, and agility.
