Bloodfist Help:  Attributes

  As you advance within the guild you will automatically earn free
attribute points which will need to be spent on one of the six
attributes.  Use the 'raise' command to advance an attribute.  Every
attribute has numerous purposes within the guild,

  1. Agility    How fast you move in combat.  Plays a role in many
                offensive and defensive abilities.

  2. Might      How strong you are.  Plays a role in damage dealt
                as well as how many weapons you can sheath at once.

  3. Accuracy   How accurate you are with weapons.  Plays a role in
                most offensive abilities.

  4. Vigor      How well you can sustain yourself in a fight.  Plays
                a role in endurance as well as many combat abilities.

  5. Wisdom     How well your intelligence is applied to your abilities.
                Plays an important role in many abilities.

  6. Faith      How great your devotion is to the guild.  Plays an
                important role in many abilities.

  All attributes can be raised as high as 100.  In most cases it is
important to get attributes to the big divisor numbers.  10, 25, 33,
50, 66, 75, and 100 are all good places to have attributes at.  All
attributes are important and should be advanced, although it is up
to you to decide in what order to advance them.  The most attribute
points you can possibly have is 600.  Some things can give bonuses
to attributes which can actually put them over 100.  Bonuses display
as either a + or - in the guild score next to the attribute's value.
