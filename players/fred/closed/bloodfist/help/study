  By watching an enemies movements you can understand it better and
thus fight more intelligently against it.  Not all opponents can be
studied, and sometimes you will have to study an enemy more than once
before you are successful.  Your wisdom must be fairly high in order
for you to study a monster, and it is also helpful to have high faith.
You can only study up to 15 monsters at a time.  To see what monsters
you have studied, type 'study'
