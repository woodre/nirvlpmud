Bloodfist Help:  Mud Who

  Mwho is an improved version of the who2 command.  It shows who is
online, as well as where they are, what guild they're in, their level,
and 6 more true or false variables in the form of [p a i c d h].  You
can not see invisible wizards with mwho, or the locations of invisible
players who are greater or equal level to yours.

  p - this player has their pk flag set
  a - this player is in a pk area
  i - this player is idle
  c - this player is currently fighting something
  d - this player is a ghost
  h - this player is hidden

Usage: mwho
