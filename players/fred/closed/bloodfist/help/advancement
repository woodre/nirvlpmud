Bloodfist Help:  Guild Advancement

  There are four different ways that you advance within the guild:

  1. Guild level
  2. Attributes
  3. Weapons
  4. Blood Honor

  1. To advance your guild level you must do two things.  First, you must
gain enough experience to reach your next level.  You gain guild experience
by fighting.  Second, you must fight and defeat a specific opponent in the
arena.  When you are ready to fight, talk to Atheos and he will prepare
the arena.  After you have won, Erilon will advance you to the next guild
level.  There are level requirements that must be met to advance to each
level:  7, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19, +3, +5.  Your strength will increase at
guild levels 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

  2. As you fight, 12% of your experience will automatically be put
towards advancing your attributes.  When you have enough experience to
advance your attributes, you will gain free attributes automatically.

  3. Just like with attributes, putting experience towards training with
a weapon happens automatically.  Whenever you are using a chosen weapon
that you have not reached level 10 with, between 18 and 24% of your
experience will automatically be put towards advancing it.  When you
have gained enough experience to advance your weapon level, it will
happen automatically.  Weapon experience can be lost if you unchoose
the weapon you trained with.

  4. Blood Honor is gained from combat.  When you have enough honor to
reach the next level, it will happen automatically.  If you lose honor
from not fighting, you can just as easilly fall back down to the prior
honor level.  Blood honor has nothing to do with experience gained.  If
honor levels are not maintained then eventually they will be lost.
