  When you are not fighting you can rest in order to recouperate your
endurance more quickly than you would otherwise.  You can not move or
fight while resting, but you can do anything else.  If you move or
start a fight then you will stop resting.  Typing 'rest' while you
are resting will make you stop resting.
