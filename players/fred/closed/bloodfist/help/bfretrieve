Bloodfist Help:  Retrieve a thrown weapon

Guild level:  3
Honor Req:    0
Base Cost:    0

  After a weapon is thrown, the only way to get it back is to retrieve it.
This prevents other players from being able to take the weapon while it
is on the ground.  When a weapon is thrown in combat there is a delay on
the amount of time it takes to be able to retrieve the weapon.  Retrieved
weapons can either be moved into your inventory or automatically sheathed
on your back (bfhelp toggle).

Usage:  bfretrieve <what|all>
