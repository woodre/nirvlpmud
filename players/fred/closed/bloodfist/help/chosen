Bloodfist Help:  Chosen

  Chosen displays the list of weapons you are currently training with,
along with how much experience you have towards each and their level.
At the start of the guild you can only choose one weapon at a time, but
as your wisdom increases you can choose up to four at a time.
  If a line displays as "error" this means that the weapon you chose
no longer exists in the same place that it used to.  Most likely if
this occurs, the file was just moved and will need to be updated by
Zeus or another senior wizard.  However, if you wish to free up the
slot and permanently lose the experience you put towards the weapon,
you can still 'unchoose' it.  UNCHOOSE CAN NOT BE UNDONE, so don't
unchoose a weapon unless you are sure that you do not want to train
with it any longer.
