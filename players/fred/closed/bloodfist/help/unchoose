Bloodfist Help:  Unchoose a Weapon

  At any time you can remove one or all of your chosen weapons.  If
you do this you will lose all the experience you put into the weapon.
THIS CAN NOT BE UNDONE, so do not unchoose a weapon unless you are
absolutely sure you want to free up that space to choose another
weapon instead.

Usage: unchoose <weapon>
