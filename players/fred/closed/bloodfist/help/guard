Honor Req:    0

  Guard target player or monster from being attacked.  If they get
attacked then you will automatically take the lead from them so their
opponent is fighting you.  If you are guarding a player, it must be
approved by the other player, and can be ended at any time by the
other player with the command 'stop guarding'.  If you are guarding
someone, type 'guard' to see who, or 'guard stop' to end it.

Usage:  guard
        guard <who>
        guard stop
        stop guarding
