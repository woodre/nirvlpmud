Bloodfist Help:  Sheath a Weapon

  You have the ability to sheath up to six weapons on your back.  The
higher your might is the more you can carry.  You don't notice the
weight of weapons as much when they are sheathed.  This allows for
easy throwing or swapping of weapons during combat.

Usage: sheath <weapon>
