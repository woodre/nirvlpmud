Bloodfist Help:  Private Room

  After guild level 1 you get your own private room within the guild
hall that can be customized to fit your own style.  The room has a
number of commands that can be performed within it, as well as your
personal gem treasure chest for storing up to 15 gems.  Here are the
commands:

  new_desc      - write a new long description for your room
  invite <who>  - invite a player to your room (50 sp)
  remove <who>  - send a player to the church from your room
  deposit       - deposit a gem into the chest
  list          - list what gems are stored in the chest
  withdraw <#>  - withdraw a gem from the chest
  show chest    - show the room the contents of the chest
