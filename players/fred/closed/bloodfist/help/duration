Bloodfist Help:  Duration Abilities

  Bloodfist have a number of abilities which last for a duration of time.
For most Bloodfist, only two of these abilities can be performed at once,
however a well trained Bloodfist can use three at once.  Whenever one
of these abilities is active it will display in the duration monitor,
which can display either the full name or the abbreviation of the ability.
