Bloodfist Help:  Guild Hall

  The Bloodfist guild hall is hidden, but obviously that doesn't mean
it is safe from attacks.  Seht Deyad defends the guild with his life,
however even he is not immune to death.  Be prepared to fight should
the guild hall be invaded.
  There are a number of rooms within the guild hall with specific
purposes.  Refer to the map to see where they are.

  Armory   - The blacksmith deals with weapons and equipment.
  Merchant - Sells water as well as other random items.
