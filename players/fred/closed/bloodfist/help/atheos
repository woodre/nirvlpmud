Bloodfist Help:  Atheos the Beastmaster

  Atheos is in charge of the arena where you must battle fierce
opponents if you wish to advance.  Once you are ready to fight
go to him and tell him that you are ready or you wish to advance.
  To gain some possible insight about your opponent you could
also inquire as to who you will be fighting.
