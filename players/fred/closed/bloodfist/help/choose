Bloodfist Help:  Choose a Weapon

  In order to train with a weapon you must first choose it.  The only
type of weapons that can't be trained with are those that are too
generic.  You can have up to four chosen weapons at once, determined
by your wisdom and faith.  A weapon can be unchoosen at any time, but
keep in mind that all the experience put towards training with it will
be lost.  There are some important things to consider when deciding
what weapon to choose:

  1. You want to pick a good weapon, since it is a weapon you will
     be using often.  It is good to pick one that either defines
     your character or has a unique special property.
  2. The better the weapon is, the longer it will take you to train
     with it.
  3. If you pick a weapon that is storable, then it will be easy to
     save in your locker until you can have it forged.  If it is not
     storable then it will be more difficult to train with because
     you will have to kill to get it every time you fight.
  4. You can never be as good with non-standard weapon types such as
     guns, magic, or telephone poles as you can with standard weapon
     types such as swords, axes or polearms.

To choose two weapons:   Wisdom >= 40,  Faith >= 10
To choose three weapons: Wisdom >= 70,  Faith >= 40
To choose four weapons:  Wisdom == 100, Faith >= 70

Usage: choose <weapon>
