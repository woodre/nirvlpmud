Bloodfist Help:  Guild Experience Transfer

  The gxp command allows you to transfer experience into the guild
in order to advance your guild level.  Unlike with weapons and
attributes, advancing your guild level requires you to move the
experience in on your own.  Thus if you don't want to advance your
guild level you don't have to.
  Typing 'gxp' alone will show you how much free experience you have
and how much guild experience you need before you can advance to the
next guild level.
  Typing gxp with a number following it will attempt to move that much
experience into the guild.  You can still move experience into the
guild even if you don't need more experience to advance to the next
guild level.

Usage: gxp
       gxp <amount>
