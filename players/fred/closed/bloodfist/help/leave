Bloodfist Help:  Leaving the Bloodfist

  After joining the Bloodfist you have a week in order to decide whether
or not you want to stay in the guild.  You can still leave the guild after
a week, however there will be a penalty, death.  The Bloodfist are in need
of new members so they are willing to give you a chance before fully
committing.
  If you decide to leave and it hasn't been a week yet, go talk to Seht
Deyad and use the command 'leave_bloodfist'.  If it has been longer than
only Erilon will be able to let you go, and he will not be as leniant.
The command is also 'leave_bloodfist' with Erilon.
