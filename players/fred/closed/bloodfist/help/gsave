Bloodfist Help:  Guild Save

  Every 10 minutes your guild information is automatically saved, but
if you want you can save it manually as well.  
  There is also a command called gupdate which gives you a new guild
object.  This only needs to be used if someone makes a change to the
guild object while you are playing.

Usage: gsave
       gupdate
