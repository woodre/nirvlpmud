Bloodfist Help:  Throw a weapon

Guild level:  3
Honor Req:    0
Base Cost:    30

  Throw a weapon at your enemy.  Not all thrown weapons are going to
hit the opponent.  Only one weapon can be thrown per round, and can
not be combined with vigor.  After a weapon is thrown it will drop to
the ground.  If you are still in combat, there will be a delay before
the weapon can be retrieved.  You can not 'get' or 'take' a thrown
weapon, rather the 'bfretrieve' command must be used.  Once combat has
ended any remaining delays on retrieving weapons are negated.  You
can throw a wielded weapon, a weapon in your inventory, or a sheathed
weapon.

Usage:  throw                      - throw current wep at current attacker
        throw unsheath             - throw 1st sheathed wep at current attacker
        throw <wep>                - throw <wep> at current attacker
        throw <npc>                - throw current wep at <npc>
        throw unsheath <wep>       - throw sheathed <wep> at current attacker
