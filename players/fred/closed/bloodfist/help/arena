Bloodfist Help:  Fighting in the Arena

  When you have gained enough guild experience to advance your
guild level, you must speak to Atheos.  Tell him you're ready
to advance.  He will then prepare the arena for you, by
summoning your opponent.  You will have about a minute when
only you can enter the arena.
  The arena consists of four seperate rooms, each of which is
accessable by the other three.  The southern two rooms both have
exits which lead out, and can be used at any time.  It is to your
advantage to make use of these rooms, and to run and heal if you
need to.
  Before the fight starts, you can ask Atheos who you will be
fighting, and he will give you a basic rundown on your opponent.
If you should happen to die in the arena, then after you pray
just go back to Atheos and let him know you died. (Bow to him).
He will escort you to a back room of the arena where you can
reclaim your things.  Make sure you can carry it all, because
you're only allowed to go back there once when you die.
