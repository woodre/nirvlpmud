Bloodfist Help:  Gems

  Gems can be socketed into weapons that are forged with a socket and
add additional bonuses to the weapon.  There are a number of ways to
get gems, including advancing within the guild, fighting monsters
in the desert, and buying them from the gem seller.  There are seven
base gems and many more rare ones.  They can be stored within your
gem chest in your private room.  Once a gem has been socketed it can
not be taken back out, so they are only good for one use.
  When you defeat an enemy in the arena and advance your guild level,
you will receive a reward of unidentified gems.  To claim the gems,
go to the gem seller and 'ask about free gems'.  If you do not claim
them, then it allows you to save more than just the 25 gems that fit
in your gem chest.  You gain this many gems for each consecutive level
when you advance: 2,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.
