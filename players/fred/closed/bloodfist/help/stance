Bloodfist Help:  Attack Stance

  You can fight with a specific stance, which allows you to determine
to what degree you want to be on the offensive.  The more you focus
towards offense while fighting, the more likely you are to take damage.
With practice you will learn which stances are appropriate for specific
combat situations.  There are five different stances, the default being
aggressive.
  
  1. Insane     Complete dedication to offense
  2. Murderous  Highly aggressive and reckless
  3. Violent    Aggressive and moderately reckless
  4. Aggressive Moderately on the offensive
  5. Neutral    Balance between offense and defense
