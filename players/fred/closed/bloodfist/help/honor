Bloodfist Help:  Blood Honor

  Blood Honor reflects how experienced of a fighter you have become.
The more you fight, the more you take damage and deal damage, the
more blood honor you will gain.  When you are not fighting, you will
slowly lose honor as your skills become less honed.  If nobody fought
anything for a long time, eventually everyone would be at 0.
  Blood Honor is divided up into six different ranks:

  1. BloodInitiate      0    - 199
  2. BloodApprentice    200  - 399
  3. BloodRogue         400  - 649
  4. BloodWarrior       650  - 1099
  5. BloodLord          1100 - 1349
  6. BloodMaster        1350 - 1500

  Some of the abilities gained with each guild level have an honor
requirement in order for them to be performed.
