Bloodfist Help:  Set Guild Title

  With each guild level in the Bloodfist there are a number of guild
titles that can be chosen.  To see a list of the titles available to
you, type 'set_title'.  Each title can be picked in a number of different
colors:  red   hir   blk   yel.
  If you have mastered a chosen weapon, you can also set your guild
title to corespond with the name of the weapon.  To see if any of your
weapons qualify, type 'set_title wep'.  If you set your title with this
option, it will look like "the Master of the weapon name".  If the word
"the" in the title does not fit, then enter a '1' for the tog variable
and the word will not be added to your title.

Usage:  set_title
        set_title <num> <color>
        set_title wep
        set_title wep <num> <tog>
