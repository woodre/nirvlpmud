Bloodfist Help:  Channel

  The bloodfist channel allows bloodfist members to easily talk with
one another when they are in different locations.  Communication is
an important element in coordinating attacks and defending the base.
  Among other things, players from outside the guild can be invited
to talk on the channel.  Any player in the guild can invite someone,
and any player can remove a guest from the channel.
