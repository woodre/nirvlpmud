messages "Welcome(fred):**The guild is officially open.  If you are just joining please read allthe help files.  There are a lot of them.  If you have any questionsthat aren't addressed in the help files and can't get an answer fromanother player feel free to mud mail me, post a note here, or use the'fred' command to report question something.  Good Luck.Fred**Warning(heman):**Greetings all Bloodfist. I'd like to impart a few things that I'vefound as help to the guild members.1. It does not say it in the help files for some reason but whenyou bow to the elder to advance to the next guil level the cutdoes a sizable amount of damage to you. I would warn that alwayshave max hps before advancing.2. Gems that you socket into weapons have an extreme chance tobreak when you unsocket them. Being since the gems you recievefrom leveling are unique, I would warn to only use them on daysthat you know you are going to be on for some time. The gems for sale at the gem seller are very good for simple runs andonly 10k. Try them out one by one, and see which ones you likethe most.3. As you may have guessed forged weapons of either no socket orsocket do not save. It might be a good idea for you, if you buya forged weapon to leave it in the equipment room for other bloodfist so tha they might use the forged weapon too. 4. The guild is extremely powerful, and we should spread the wordto others. Promote the guild to all that ask, and we will build agrand army of bloodfist. The more in number, the stronger we are.If you have other things to place on this board the command to adda new note is ( note blah blah ).**Bloodfist Equipment(forbin):**Good news, Bloodfists...You may start noticing "regular" equipment modify your guild attributes.We are not going to tell you which items, but I/Me/We are in the processof adding this functionality to certain equipment pieces.  So keep aneye out.Forbin**BF loyalty(fred):**I've updated the guild helpfile concerning loyalty.  It appearsthat some of you like to try to read between the lines on prettymuch everything to try to get away with things.  Before in thehelpfile for loyalty there was a final line that said somethingto the affects of "You can't ever really trust even yourguildmembers."  I looked at this as yes this is a game and at some point even guildmembers may lie to you misguide you somewhat.  Others looked at it as well I can't attack my guildmate but it's okay for me to lead them to a pk area where my friend can kill them.  I don't agree with this sinceyour loyalty to the guild should take precendance over yourloyalty to outside alliances/friends.  I removed the last lineso there won't be anymore debate/arguing/etc over what it "truely"means.  From now on if I see/learn of someone purposley helpingsomeone outside the guild in any way/shape/form to get a guild member killed you will be removed this guild.Fred**Honor(fred):**You can now display your blood honor in your monitorif you wish to do so.  Just add #bf# where you wantit to show up.  Suggested by Maul.  I believe otherssuggested it in the past I was just too lazy to getaround to doing it. =PFred**Honor(maul):**  1. BloodInitiate      0    - 1992. BloodApprentice    200  - 3993. BloodRogue         400  - 6494. BloodWarrior       650  - 10995. BloodLord          1100 - 13496.

If you don't have the amountavailable in the bank it will go off of your regular coinssame as before.  Thanks.Frep**RE:Bloodfist EQ(spitgemz):**Bracers of Speed (Maledicta's: Red Dragon Caves)A golden earring (Vertebrakers: Juribel)A ju ju trinket (Forbins: Qei)Shadowveil (Arrinas: Qurd Mage)Bishop Ring (Trix's Realm: a proud bishop)a long black robe (Zeus Fallen Lands: Tyborlek)Legendary Onyx Platemail (Zeus's Fallen Lands: ?)A ruby amulet (Zeus's Fallen Lands: ?)If you have any problems finding these areas go: 3e,s,w from Green: Ask dood there.SALUTE**"
