just since last night to this morning from being not logged in while i slept, i've lost 3 or 4 honor. this shouldn't happen, as some of us have lives and can't be on killing 24 friggin 7, but the penalty for being logged in and idle should be a little bigger in place of it

Jul 22 10:02 Grog (players/zeus/desert/r/ec17):
everytime i die or something I have to relog because the +\- shit with the attribs gets thrown all out of whack

Jul 22 11:21 Carnage (players/boltar/casino/room#1701):
i think you should be able to gupdate when you have attrib bonuses when it's errored just like when you have - when your not wearing anything

Jul 22 11:41 Carnage (players/forbin/realms/flame_forest/RMS/ff06_08):
just an idea any chance of gaining a fourth duration at like 1500 honor or something

resting still doesn't turn off when endurance is full sometimes

Jul 28 13:43 Carnage (players/beren/Rooms/Olgyo/oroom16):
idea if your killing more than one mob bloodfury should last until your done fighting , not when the first mob dies

there seems to be a problem with the xetra claws, everyone once in a while i seem to have a cloned pair of xetra claws,wither that or it just shows up that there are some on the floor and some on my hands, dunno, but it may be because clash of wielding due to bfs being under special circumstance, also one more thing, when you pick up other pair of claws, it doesnt show up in your inventory, ill show ademonstration next time your on

if other players can get into our guild and kill the npcs, we should have the rooms pk or someway to protect them

i have an idea for soul gem....since it seems to be a rare level 3 gem how about making it if you actually get one then when you socket it it captures the soul of your victim and makes them do your bidding for a short time....something of a rare guild pet

Feb 27 22:25 Theseius (players/fred/closed/bloodfist/r/meeting):
minds eye gem is bugged....when you use it it causes you to lose your soul and heartbeat just thought you should know
