custom_desc "  A small, square room has been hewn from sandstone rock.  Soft,silky sand blankets the floor and spills out of the doorway to thewest.  Several torches hang on the walls, their red light tintingeverything the color of blood, while in a far corner, a tall brazierburns a mound of incense, filling the room with the sweet smell of cinnamon and vanilla.  There is a treasure chest near the doorway,and a sleeping mat lies rolled beside it.  A rectangular open-airwindow has been carved out of the stone; stars shimmer like brightpinpoints of light in the black night sky beyond.  In the center ofthe room, a pool of liquid dark matter bubbles and writhes with a life of its own, testament to a bond once strong, but now broken."
