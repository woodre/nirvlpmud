The ability to recruit is accomplished by bringing
the player you wish to bring into the guild to the
symbiote cave.  There you 'open crack', and tell
the prospect to 'challenge symbiote' if they are
19+8 or higher.  Recruit with caution, Idiots are
not welcome into the guild.

Commands:  open crack (opens the challenge room up)
           challenge symbiote (command for prospect
           to enter the challenge room)
