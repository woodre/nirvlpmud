Regeneration is a tentacle power that will allow
the user to turn the Dark Matter into their body
and slowly heal their wounds.  The more tentacles
you assign to Regeneration, the better chance of
being able to heal each round. There is a constant
drain on sps to keep this power going.

Cost: 10 Sps and 1 Mp to start.
Skill Level: Control 6
