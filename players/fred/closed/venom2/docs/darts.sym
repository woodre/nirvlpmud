Darts will fire out a volley of powerful Dark Matter
projectiles.  Damage is dependent on level of Combat
skill, as is Cost.  At 6th level Combat the projectiles
will have a chance of burrowing into your opponent
and causing extensive damage over time. Darts can
only be fired if no one is hitting you.

Cost: Varies by Combat Level
Skill Level: Combat 2
