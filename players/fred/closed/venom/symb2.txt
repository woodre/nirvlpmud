                      -=[ Symbiote Guild ]=-
                      
This is a watered-down version of the guild summary. This covers
powers, and other pertinent info.
 
Guild Disadvantages:

1.  Miniguilds       : not allowed, this includes the loss of the following...
                       no portal spells 
                       no flat healing spells 
                       no healing decorpse
                       no lead spell
                       no weapon comparison
                       no light spell
                       no increased stealth
                       
2.  Quit             : cannot quit while in combat
                
3.  Game Spells      : no game spells

4.  Pets(Any major command issued for a pet will devour the pet(dest it)
         if owned by the symbiote)
                     : no mud pets  
                       
5.  Magic            : magic is restricted to 5 max, sp is still a prime factor.
                       This example list does not include all abilities vital to
                       a symbiotes performance, costs range up to 75% sp
                       low range attack spell costs 15 sp
                       mid range attack spell costs 30 sp
                       high range attack spell costs 40 sp
                         
6.  Matter           : some abilities require matter expenditures. Matter can only 
                       be obtained though corpse draining, corpse draining offers
                       no benefits, max matter = 300, transformation cost = 200,
                       this leaves little matter to work with. Also 100 more matter
                       must be obtained to transform again after the initial
                       transformation. If mp drops below 10 then 50 hps will be
                       transfered to 10 matter.
                                                      
7.  Armor            : no armor in symbiotic form, can use armor in human form.
                       ac averages between 6-9 (compared to the high of 18 for
                       guildless and others)
                       ac low 4 5% of the time
                       ac high 23 5% of the time
                       some abilities affect ac
                       hypermode increases dmg at the loss of -3 to -4 ac

8.  Weapons          : can not use weapons in symbiote form.
                       can use weapons in human form, although no spells
                       besides a decorpse in human form(gives only matter
                       points, no hps)

10. Infusion         : symbiotes are affected negatively by healing powers,
                       5 damage on a 25% chance until infusion is gone

AutoMoves (attack and defense):
Here are the attack averages with guild weapon and add-ons:
Average damages(NO ATTACK SPELLS):
Symbiote**********************************************
19th level with no additional enhancements:  
3.578 for 100 rounds vs. 17 ac.

19th level with Sword/spear/axe ability on:
5.66 for 100 rounds vs. 17 ac.

19th level with Sword/spear/axe ability and hypermode for one
set:
6.257 for 100 rounds vs. 17 ac.
*******************************************************
                VS.
guildless**********************************************
Guildless with a weapon that is 18 wc with a 25% special of 6:
3.736 for 100 rounds vs. 17 ac.

Guildless with AIR:
8.687 for 100 rounds vs. 17 ac.

Guildless with CHAINGUN:
10.54 for 100 rounds vs. 17 ac.
*******************************************************
And just for laughs:
19+21 poly in tetra with 4 wc 18 weps:
22.402 for 100 rounds vs. 17 ac. 

This may be too low. Might need to up, but will find out in beta
testing.
 
Defense:
 In changed form the players base ac is random(stealth /2)
 (Note that this guild does not use mini guilds, so no feline bonus on stealth).
 Each round an additional bonus is possible to ac. The following is a listing of
 defense moves. Note that if one move goes off, then none of the others are 
 possible that round. This is HIGHLY randomized. 
  
      50%    +1 ac
      40%    +2 ac
      30%    +3 ac
      20%    +4 ac
       5%    +14 ac

Abilities:
NOTE: sp cost is at best, some start at a much higher amount and are lowered
the more it is used. All attack spells work this way.

                                   allow for double the bonus to the

**********************ATTACK SPELLS*******************************************
Web slam    sp: 15         6       Base dmg: (5-15)  Advanced dmg: (10-20)

Frenzy      hp: 10-30     15       Frenzy adds directly to the symbiote wep.
                                   The bonuses are 15, 30, or 45. This spell
                                   runs off of hps, mp, as well as a new source
                                   known as frenzy_level.  Frenzy level can be
                                   driven up in this way:
                                   A very hard hit raises it 1 pt.
                                   bone crushing raises it 3 pts.
                                   massacre raises it 8 pts.
                                   When the players frenzy level reaches:
                                   20, then they can cast it at level 1 and
                                   receive a bonus of 20 to the wc. At 40 pts
                                   can cast for a 30 bonus. At 60 pts can cast
                                   and receive a bonus of 40.  Other spells
                                   can not be cast at the same time as this one.
