Changes:

-- The 'mon' command now lists your current MP if you're changed.
-- There is now a 'fixit' command to report any bugs typos etc.
-- Extra look has been updated to either Name has or You have in 
   your description.
-- I added a channel to report changes to those that are online 
   atm.  It will list as your Symb name tells you: msg.
-- Added % carry to the score and the i command.
-- Fixed the store_coins command in the ghall.
-- Fixed the extra look so it shows if your arm has taken a shape.
-- Upped 'regen' so it's a little more effective.
-- Tweaked your offense skills so you should hit a little harder 
   on average.  It's a work in progress.
-- Changed link <shape> some.  Your first shape change will cost 
   50 MP.  Any other changes during that login will only cost 20 MP.
-- Fixed link harden it wasn't counting down properly making it so 
   you couldn't harden, unharden, and reharden again.
-- changed the 'fatal' command to add a little spice to your normally
   dreary mudlife.  Thank Forbin.
-- changed 'hypermode'.  You no longer 'have' to have PK set to use 
   hypermode, but there are extra bonuses if you do have PK set.
   Think of it as the difference between P2 and P3 for cybers.
-- Thanks to Madness's ever watchful ways it was realized that the
   combat messages (i.e., You hit, massacred, etc.) didn't coincide
   with the actual dmg dealt.  They were basically completely
   random so your Destroyed could have been like dmg 3 heh.  I've
   fixed them now.  You won't notice as many D E S T R O Y E D msgs
   now (in fact if you get on of those without Hypermode that's like
   an act of god and you should consider buying lottery tickets.
   But now the messages will actually mean something.  Only the msgs
   have changed don't worry you're still doing the same amount of dmg.

 Any questions, concerns, suggestions, mudmail me.
      Thanks,
          Fred
