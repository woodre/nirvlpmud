We are able to absorb corpses even if 'blocked' like most other guilds

symbiote shadow should be like Lich or Deathknight - we should show up on all the who screens as our symbiote name (alterego)

it would be nice if guild emotes worked from afar

webslam w/harden would be nice... some way to deal some damage.

Reptile reported from:
players/snow/shadows/fort/throne_room
a lead would be nice too.

perhaps we could trade web for a spell that makes us invis/see in the dark?

bite seems to cost a LOT more than it does... it cost about 5 mp and 30 sp for 5 life

when i log in and morph, i cant immediately after link an axe, i have to kill a mob and absorb its corpse..even though i have plenty of mp to form the axe, is that the way its supposed to be? or is that a bug?

Smack reported from:
players/hawkeye/room/newbie2
if unmorphed we should, in my opinion, be just like a guildless, specially when you crash out or something without enough mp to morph...would be nice to have game spells then..maybe not sonic..but fireball at least..just my opinion

Smack reported from:
players/boltar/hotel/room#1175
the healing thing that pple can do to us needs to be toned down a bit, i fought someone who healed me like 4 times and i took almost 200 hpts of damage AFTER the fight was over..i mean that is cheap and sleezy and very exploitable, and common knowledge to do to a symb

you wanted flavor things, do neo's have an invis..maybe the tentacles wrap around you and hide you from sight...would be good for a pk guild to have as most other ones have it..

not sure how things are supposed to be with the corpse looting or anything, but I can use absorb even when I didnt tank, not sure if that should be blocked or not

got a sensitive mind after a kill with a snow demon on a fatal it was an impale

Evolution reported from:

just opinion i think we might be able to hit harder since we can't use wocket pets, they are great help in npc illing

Webslinger reported from:

perhaps have hypermode last a lil bit longer?

I think it would be cool if the best kill didn't have (Fighting YOU!) in it

The fatal descriptions seem to be gender female onle, even when fighting male opponents.  Finding a way to specific him or her depending on the mob might be nice.

I was thinking that it would be very good for the theme of the symbiotes if we had more symbiotic emotions while in changedform

Ingvaard reported from:
players/saber/ryllian/arena5
I have an alias for 'bite fruit' for the Roht fruit.  If I don't have any in my inventory, it seems to trigger the 'bite' skill from the symbiote skill.  I can't tell if this is caused by the alias system, the fruit, or the symbiote.

damage messages seem to be random there was a npc at green that gave damage reports and i got 4 damage from a D E S T R O Y E D and like 40 from a massacred

Evolution reported from:

Fervens reported from:
room/vill_green
As a suggestion, i think that symbs should have slightly higher base armor class and mabey a little on damage while in form. It just seems that it isn't worth it to changeform if you have decent gear, you take less damage and can handle much stronger mobs.

weblsam needs to be changed for the # given to it

webslam and bite seem to not do anything for me.  There is no message or anything, just a new prompt.

There is an issue with the neo trial.  Please check mine.  It killed me twice(1x outside the crack) and was still attacking me after I prayed at the green.
