messages "Vampire Applicants(magus, Jun 17, 2000):**Give your note some thought.  We want to know why you desire to join usand what you bring to our family.  We care not about your current statsbut more about who you are.  Many have been rejected because their notedid not ring true to our ears....**Guild-hoppers(sticks, May  1, 2005):**Vampires, as a rule, will NOT bite peoplewho have been in another guild with a given character. We don't like thosewho join a guild and then leave itjust to try another.  If you have beenin another guild and want to join thevampires, you better have a damn goodreason (like the guild closed) for leaving said guild...or you can figurewe will pretty much ignore your request.(At least, I will...so don't even ask.)**Application(morrigan, Jun 16, 2007):**I have been drawn to this place, I do not know why, but, yes I am sure of it. I have been feeling very strange as of late, like a tiny twinge at the back of my mind, A hunger, A need to be at this place at this moment. So I came here, and what do I find, this board. Now I know what I need to do.  Yes, joining this family will help me to grow and understand things that have been  slipping through my fingers. Help me to understand what seems at times to be right in front of my eyes, but at others flying off into the nether regions of this untamed world. What are these things, I do not have a clue, but I do know I will find them soon. Really, why would they present themselves if I was never meant to know, I have asked myself this many times. As of now  I can see the end of all my wonderings. It seems it is time to help you understand who and what I am about.My name is Morrigan. I am what most would call a child, but only in age and looks. In reality I have been raised beyond my years, if you do not understand what is meant by that,  let me break it down a little more. I was never aloud to have a childhood. Since my mother died when I was just a 8 years old and my father was not to be found I essentially grew up on the streets. That is until my 13th year when I found my father and learned that he was a very rich man. Living with him taught me the finer things of life, culture, art, and the such. What I have learned In the last 4 years together with the knowledge of the streets has made me into a very different individual. How different? That is for you to find out. Now what I will be able to bring to the family I am unsure of. Maybe, just maybe my loyalty and understanding of individuals will be in my advantage. The knowledge of life that is within me will help at times and  the friendships I can build  are exceptionally  strong and can last for a very long time. I have found in life there is no sure things. Knowledge is one of the only things you should hold dear. When you find a place you finally belong do not give it up for if you do you will have nothing.Sincerely Morrigan**What's Family? A Coven, !(mrjones, Aug 21, 2007):**I wish to join your coven. I know thyat your ways are picky, but the they should be. By picking me I am sure that I can forefill a gap in this world.

I hope that my honor and my leadership could be usefull to help making this guild more than it is by showing others the true meaning  of being a Vampire..Thank you for your time Mrjones..**ll*****I would like to join(hellkat, Aug 25, 2007):**I am hellkat, I am rather new here and I would like to join your guild. I looked at others and i sence that I would like to become more...I can achieve that through the vampires guild. I know that this guild was at one time the strongest and most prestgious to be with, now a days you can't pay someone to get one to be a vampire...I would like to change that thought...Their are many guilds to choose from but I would like to pledge my dying breath to the Vampires Guild...the only guild for me...I hope you find my sincerity worthy and my heart true...Please this is what i want...a family...your truely Hellkat**"
