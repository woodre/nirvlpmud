Welcome to mand [Manual Daemon] 0.1

Welcome to the [1;33mMAND[2;37;0m help system. This is a prototype help file
daemon to read in various help files from predefined directories.
This system has been designed to bypass the original help system
to enable more functions and execute a greater level of control
over the way the information is presented.

This is currently a work in progress and will be changing and
developing over time as bugs are ironed out, features are
evaluated and the whole system is enabled. If there are problems
with the help files, let someone know immediately. Generally that
someone should be Vital as he is responsible for this horrible
morass of code that he is somehow trying to cram into the mold of
a guild.

The basic command is '[1;37mman[2;37;0m' which lets you access the files. It
can access the existing help files as well as special files
defined for this system. The system for reading files is portable
and can be readily adapted for other developers. At some future
date, there may even be a way to present feedback via this
mechanism. If there are other features that you would like to see
included in a help reader, feel free to let your feelings be made
know.

Thanks, [34mVital[2;37;0m
