    Prolepsis, precognition, d-jumping or teleportation, 
bilocation, deja-vu,
synchronicitous phenomena (influencing future events) 
and cosmic consciousness. 
**** innate prestrike capabilities [always hits first]

12:32:54 AM - E600 - CE rig to help enhance metafunctions.

|||| Cerebroentergetic Enhancer - a device first used for
|||| greatly increasing the metapsychic output of the human
|||| brain. Certain smaller devices are called brain-boosters
|||| but the term is generally reserved for the machinery
|||| which increases the output of a single selected
|||| metafunction many hundred fold. The operator's body
|||| is often placed in suspended animation through cryogenics
|||| and the brains protoplasm artificially strengthened.
|||| Needle electrodes inserted into the brain 'grow' an
|||| auxiliar cerebral neurostructure that transmits the power
|||| to the brain from an external power source. The use of
|||| the CE rig is extremely hazardous to all but the most
|||| powerful human operants.
