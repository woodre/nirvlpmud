Creativity:



    Ability of the mind to formulate novel ideas or 

exert a direct influence upon matter or energy. 

Ranges from artistic talent and scientific facility to

powerful mind bolts of psychoenergy. Usual manifestations 

include shape-shifting; illusion generation, 

invisibility, flame, light, electrical bolt generation 

through simple chemical decomposition of organic or 

atmospheric molecules, body aura generation, 

temperature changing or the modification of physical

appearance of substances. Less common are: phasing through objects, 

transmuting matter to energy, psychocreative 

bubble or other shield generation, weather modification. 

Often combined with PK in matter modification and 

redaction in healing.

11:33:42 PM - Farsensing:



    Embraces telepathy (farspeech), extended 

sight (farsight or clairvoyance), extended

hearing (clairaudience), deep sight ('x-ray'

vision) and other metacommunications. The 

most common metafunction and it has much room 

for expansion.

|||| Often dubbed "farspeakers",

|||| they are able to detect an individual by mean

|||| of their mental 'signature', mass-sensing, 

||||infra-red sensing(dark sight), even the detection

|||| of screened mines. Operation of the farsenses

|||| is impeded by electromagnetic phenomena and

|||| by matter interposed between the farsensor 

|||| and the sensed objective. Dense rock and metal

|||| make it difficult and cerametal is all but

|||| impervious to the most powerful minds. The

|||| farsensor have a very unique brain circuitry

|||| peripheral to that of the other metafaculties.

More: (line 21) 

|||| It is one of the most common metafunctions,

    Psychic healing, mind alteration, mind editing. 

Rarest of all metafunctions, involves the ability of the 

mind to exert healing power upon its own body

or mind or those of another. 

It also encompasses empathy and solace giving.

    Involves the ability of a mind to move or otherwise 

manipulate matter, known also as telekinesis. 

Strength enhancements and speed are helped as well. 

Any other functions that are dealing with 

carrying and flying are helped.

|||| The common notion is that PK adepts were the

|||| least valuable metafunction, although PK was

|||| very helpful in micro-physical-manipulation

|||| and certain delicate movements. The faculty is

|||| especially attuned to combat and healing when

|||| combined with redaction.
