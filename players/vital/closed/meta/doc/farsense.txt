11:33:42 PM - Farsensing:

    Embraces telepathy (farspeech), extended 
sight (farsight or clairvoyance), extended
hearing (clairaudience), deep sight ('x-ray'
vision) and other metacommunications. The 
most common metafunction and it has much room 
for expansion.
|||| Often dubbed "farspeakers",
|||| they are able to detect an individual by mean
|||| of their mental 'signature', mass-sensing, 
||||infra-red sensing(dark sight), even the detection
|||| of screened mines. Operation of the farsenses
|||| is impeded by electromagnetic phenomena and
|||| by matter interposed between the farsensor 
|||| and the sensed objective. Dense rock and metal
|||| make it difficult and cerametal is all but
|||| impervious to the most powerful minds. The
|||| farsensor have a very unique brain circuitry
|||| peripheral to that of the other metafaculties.
|||| It is one of the most common metafunctions,
|||| and even latents can 'call' and be heard by an
|||| operant after suitable training.
