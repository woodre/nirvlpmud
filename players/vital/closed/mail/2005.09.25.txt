I sitebanned Krillgeta/Glaxgor and Shinshi/Fleshhunter 
for actively recruiting peeps for Elysium on here as 
well as continuing to develop code and rip off stuff 
from here onto there. I gave them their warning, they 
lied and failed to heed it, in fact denied being on 
Elysium at all - I believed what they said until 
Worm gave me his password there as a developer and 
I saw that they were using other player's names from 
here [Element and Fury] in order to mask their identities 
and keep it secret from us.

I'm just curious if Caelin is actually going to code or 
just chat around. If she's just going to chat, let's code 
her a custom chat object, a chat room, and let her go at 
it for the benefit of all. 
 
She isn't really contributing anything development-wise 
to the community.

Also would like to do some basic feasibility studies on

Cc: (To: stardream) vital

ok, the logs are kept in /pa/log 
 
DISREGARD the /pa/log/ip_data subdirectory, 
 this is some behind the scenes stuff. 
 
I haven't yet written the commands for turning on and 
off logging, but essentially you will only have to turn 
the bug onto one char .. it is based on IPs [which are dynamic] 
so it COULD happen that a subsequent login could require 
a new bug call.. but it will be easy, nonetheless. 
 
Just read through the logs in /pa/log .. i advise using 
"more" .. if you need to FTP them and read them late, 
copy them to your closed/ directory ... not to your root. 
And just delete all the ones you've checked. Let me or 
Vital know of any violations. 
If you're not sure who a particular char is that's being 
logged, 
 
  cat /pa/log/ip_data/alts/<name> 
 
This will give you a list of alt chars, but again 
this isn't 100% precise.

I jailed Krillgeta for using keepalive triggers .. 
 
Yes, we no longer have idle quit. He's using an 
Elysium trigger. Triggers at all are banned. 
If he doesn't understand this, he should read "help bots". 
 
I jailed him for a week [2nd infraction per help prison].
