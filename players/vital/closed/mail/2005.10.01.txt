Thomas was once again logged on with another char from the same ip. 
I'm frankly quite tired of his usual BS, but i'm not a PA or a Senior/Elder, 
so I'm doing my 'job' and report it thusly.

I've written a modest news group system and a newsgroup 
reader that has been slipped into the /bin/play/_read command 
to allow players access to it. 
 
Postings from boards all over the mud have and can be moved 
to the newsgroups.

the double templar cloning bug is fixed 
if it happens to any other guild file things, 
they HAVE to have an id of "GI" in all set_guild_file

 Ok, I thought it was agreed the files would be moved into the guilds 
directory.  
 
What the hell is going on? Beck starts moving them and you demote him 
to stop it?

 Re:   rangers
Cc: (To: boltar) vertebraker,vital

laf, no. I have started moving them to guilds. The files that are there 
ones that have been put there by me. Beck was demoted because he's never 
here, serves no useful purpose and only causes people to get upset when he 
logs on. He has repeatedly said that he is more interested in playing "high 
tech" and "graphically intensive" games rather than Nirvana. If he wants to 
come back, log in more regularly and help the other developers, that's 
great. 
 
In the meantime I've been working hard on the Rangers to keep them uptodate 
and semi-competitive [though less so that most other guilds as Beck's 
original intent was for it to an RP- focused guild.  
 
Beck's situation is hardly unique or special and not worth the 
effort to fuss about. It has happened in the natural course of 
the life of the game that seniors have come and gone, Mythos, 
Mizan, Eurale, Snow, Pain... the list goes on. The game however 
moves on in a stateful life of its own.

I'm going to rewiz Pav with boltar's permission. 
I'm going to stick a logging device on him. And I'll 
approve everything of his. Just youse guys keep an eye 
on him as well. First sign of trouble, we'll boot him.

tristian has been bugging the shit out of eveyrone. 
now he is bugging sparkle about not looking at his area 
in the past 2 days. i'm getting seriously fed up 
with him. he's a fukin jackass 
and completely ignorant. he pissed me off thru the whole 
mage beta test.

1 ]tristian is just an asshole. i've talked with him. 
2 ]if it continues, he's done. 
3 ] 
4 ]i'm sick of getting bothered by him. 
5 ] 
6 ]pavlik is the least we have to worry about. if anything, 
7 ]his only problem would be not logging in, i think. 
8 ]but he seems pretty enthusiastic and interested that 
i would want him back. 
9 ]10]he is very creative and has experience with programming 
11]and so forth. 
12] 
13]sparkle has a good heart, she is just a bit talkative. 
14]i have sort of taken her under my wing and made friends 
15]with her while keeping tabs on her behavior. i don't necessarily 
16]agree with everything she does, but i think we don't have 
to worry about her being so much of a drain for wiz information. 
18]i'm going to keep the bug on just so we are all agreed. 
19] 
20]i am worried MOST about khrell, because he is completely 
21]unstable and has been acting very erratic recently. his 
22]jealous behavior towards every woman on the mud is annoying. 
23]i must say that i'm sick of giving him breaks. i know he 
24]has rl mental problems, but i would guess that is true with 
25]most people on the mud to some degree or another. 
26] 
27]mosobp seems fine now. i have been keeping some tabs on him 
28]and trying to build up his confidence in himself again. just 
29]treat him like a wizard again -- his faults weren't that big. 
30]he is my age too, which is pretty young, and he doesn't 
31]take the mud as seriously as he should properly -- but he 
32]isn't a sinkhole for information and actually RESPECTS me, 
33]so there is a leg up. 
34] 
35]who else ? oh.. 
 
36]37]mokri is another to watch. he acts like khrell in the 
38]same two-faced, jealous manner. he also is extremely good 
39]with code, so watch for him making snoop tools and the like, 
40]then removing them when he's not using them. 
41] 
42]make sure you clean this mudmail out so others can't spy on 
43]it. i don't like my feelings about other wizards being passed 
44]on. 
45] 
46]anyway, i think all of these people are potentially good coders. 
47]they just need guidance. out of all of them, i think khrell is 
48]the most incorrigible.
