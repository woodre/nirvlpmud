messages "NEW CHANGES(Roland the Hunter Ranger):**If you haven't already noticed, the guild has been changed.Right now there are only basic skills and fighting stats for everyone, until more functions are coded.Please use the things you have and advance as you wish.type "skills" and "ranger skills" for some more info.I will post more details as they become available.Please let me know if you encounter any errors with specific information.ThanksRoland/Beck**Choosing Weapon and Animal names(Jazz the Silver Test Ranger):**You can now choose your weapon and zord name inside the command center.Use the 'Weapon' command to choose the weapon name.Likewise use 'Animal' for the zord name.Jazz/Beck**Guild Updated(Jazz the Silver Test Ranger):**OK we have a lot of new people and some people who now have played in here a lot.I want to know what needs to be fixed, and what things people would like to see.Items you will not see are: invisibility of any sort, private guild channel (choose your allies wisely)Items I know about:  Zord issues...becoming lost etc.Other than that, what are your ideas.   Are there items for the command center you would like to see?  Combat, non combat (what I really want), etc.I left plenty of board space to post.Its your guild...let me know what you are interested in.Beck**New Guilds(Ghost the Transparent Ranger):**As stated when you were recruited, and in the Ranger conduct.We are a 'good' guild.  Any guild based on evil (cyberninja,dark order) we should not associate with at all.  If you have"friends" in those guilds then they will understand the roleyou are playing on this mud as a Power Ranger.  BCM's are upto your own decision though they are not to become allies asspecifically noted by Beck.  Personal 'alliances' and the likethat have no effect on our Team I have no problem with at all.Any other ?'s write em on the globe 8)**Personal issues(Jazz the Silver Test Ranger):**I hope that people can keep personal issues and attacks off the mud, but it appears some people can't.  For cases where allies are disrupting things, or can't seem to role play and separate real life from Nirvana, there is a banish command.I trust your judgement, so use it if you really need to.  If you are unsure, or not able to use the command, mail Beck to take care of it.The current allies causing problems have been banished meaning they can't be allies or rangers.Jazz/Beck**Respect(Ghost the Transparent Ranger):**  We should keep in mind our Team needs to be shown theut-most respect.  In relation and in conversation. Weare a Team.  Every one of us must respond as such. Thereis no room for "I do not like him or her for such or sachand will not do this or that because of so and what" that'suncalled for.  Things to take note:Do not. Do Not.  DO NOT.  D O  N O T ! ! ! under any circumstances break the alt char personal information act.ACPIA for short.  This is ludacris (holla!) for someone tobreak. Stupid.  Keep that stuff off and unspoken.  ESPECIALLYWIZZARD ALTS - WTF? You wanna go to prison - they have shorttempers. (boggle like a beano)Do not. Do Not. DO NOT.  D O  N O T ! ! ! under anycircumstance talk about ourselves to people outside of ourteam. If we have a problem, it needs to stay in our Team.Do not. Do Not.  DO NOT.  D O  N O T ! ! ! under anycircumstance compain to a wizard about our Team issues. They are not here to "patrol" us.  Unless there is a true guild related problem (no NPC weakness doesn't count)That's all for now --Ghost-**Issues response.(Jazz the Silver Test Ranger):**Recruiting:  If you guys are complaining about not having enough recruiters, suck up the skill points yourself.  Roll some from combat over to leadership so you can do it yourself.  The ball is in your court.  Don't rag on the people who actually thought about more than their mob killing skills.Healers:It came to my attention that a healer was participating in killing our NPC's through indirect means.  The healer issue has come up several times in the past.For a healer to role-play correctly they must heal regardless of background.  For a ranger to role-play, he must not associate with evil or their helpers.Its a tough role, because while people are very good at heart, there is a role-playing conflict.I just threw out the bit about no longer allowing recruiting for healers.  Apparently there is some erruption, but never has anyone addressed either side with me.Keep in mind #1 if any of our allies were to attack a ranger NPC directly it automatically strips them of ally status.#2 our ally channel is a powerful but open tool.  I expect you guys to manage it, but some things could be at risk (from a role-playing perspective).#3 Its still just a chat channel.  By not allowing certain people as allies only means they arent on the channel, not that they can't play with you etc.Since I haven't heard much from either side (until I threw something out there on purpose to get a response...Im smarter than I look), I will leave it as is.  If I hear much more on this though I will take some action of my own doing, unless I hear some pro-active discussion.Overall guild quality/play:Im a little concerned about Coopers statement about the guild being poor at the moment.  Is this the personel, the skills, etc.?What does everyone think?  I really strived for a self-sufficient guild where I don't have to be involved for it to run.  Am I making a poor assumption that it can run without me?Forgive me that I dont have a lot of time here.  I got layed off, I have a one year old sun, and am enjoying much higher tech role playing games.If I am needed though, I am here and I will fix things.  I just need to know.If you have any issues make sure you mail Beck, and ONLY Beck.ThanksBeck/Jazz**Recruitment(Ghost the Transparent Ranger):**Well, I have no problem recruiting.  I actually have a set oftrials (one mental and one physical [for a lvl 10ish]) foranyone who wants to join the guild.  My initial intuitionwas to make this person an ally before we make them a Teammember.  But we cannot due to alliance restrictions forpeople without a guild.  So, if anyone has interest insomeone joining our Team you just send over.**Note Consolidation New Recruits(Sundin the Brandy Ranger):**The note is titled 'New recruits(Kezef the Sand Ranger)':Ok people this is Team center guild its not for one person to recruit a ranger its a job for everyone.  I've been a ranger for some where bordering on forever and i still don't remember what every ranger teaches.  The recruiters job is to get the ranger started after that if a new recruits have a problem (like he can't remember who teaches weapon) he has the guild channe to ask or god forbid go looking for the ranger and see for himself.For New Rangers - READ THE HELP FILES thats what they do is help.  If you have a question ask.  If your having trouble fight ask if some has time for a party.  We might not have time to party but if your nice we'll keep you in mind.Quick referenceTommy - MorphBilly - CommunicationTrini - WeaponoppsTrini - TeleportKimberly - WeaponZack - machineJason - Leadership + TeamMorihei - CombatProtege - Armorand finnally our Evil NPC SOUP NAZI - Donate (seems kinda strange huh)I know getting to morihei the soup nazi and protege are not the easiest places to get too and maybe a NICE ranger will post directions (I know how to get there but not very directions orintated)Kezef the Wannabe Tye-Dye RangerThe note is titled 'directions to morhei and protege(Mosh the Navy Ranger)':**some directions for new rangers(Rick the Coffee Ranger):**How to get to the green from the Command Centerpush button, d, 2n, 3w, s, 4ehow to get to protege from the green4w, n, 2e, 2s, whow to get to angel park from the green4w, n, 9ehow to get to morihei from angel parkgo n, till you find a red balloon, ride balloon, climb dunes, wander path, walk field, walk cliffs, climb rocksHow to dump collectorsconfigure #configure transferconfigure power 100configure onlineconfigure**Deploying(Cooper the Moss Ranger):**I have emailed some of you, but others that do not know I am deploying in june.

Just wanted to let you know that Vital, the lovely,helpful wiz that he is, fixed some things for us!Now if your Zord dies in combat, you may recall it,without relogging!

I'm not trying to act like the guild leader or anything but I just wanted to let everyone know that we need to keep it up.If you use a lot of it, then you need to PLEASE atleast restore some of it. If our guild power gets to 0, then we will not be able to morph or anything. I've already emptied the collectors but I cant kill right nowto help it get up. Let's keep the guild power up, please? :P-Viper**"
