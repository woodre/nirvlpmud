Ok, so here it is. A challenge system. One player publicly challenges 
another, and the message shows to everyone that there has been a challenge 
issued. A good way of calling someone out without flapping over a public 
channel. Also, make it so if the challenge is accepted, it goes to a 
special challenge arena....no leave, no dc, no quit, no tele. maybe make it 
so if you lose, the winnder gets to pick one piece or something from the 
opponent's gear, and the coins or something. and get challenge arena win 
points This would get alot more people interested in pk. maybe even make 
the death cost less xps. who knows. I just think calling someone out by 
issuing a public challenge would be better than flapping over a channel.

Here's an idea I've wanted to do myself, but since I'm never going to 
have enough time to wiz here, let alone relearn how to code LP, I'll pass 
it on to you. 
I've always wanted to do an ICP-themed area, and make a Juggalo guild.  You 
know...crazy-ass freaks running around with hatchets, kicking bottles of Faygo 
at anything that moves.  I was thinking of doing subsections based on each of 
their albums (Ringmaster, Milenko, CoC, Bizzarre, Wraith, etc.). 
Let me know what you think.

 They can only be made on LD....  but wax broke LD before leaving because 
he didn't check something he changed. Problem is it's one of those  
errors that doesn't say what it is. So, when I get home I have to make 
replacements of suspect recently edited files with backups until it works 
again. 
 
The DR driver can't handle .whatever files for some reason

This one is in left field... How about a guild of dragons!!! some of the 
details i have came up with: 1.)  Only 5 allowed in the game period, not 
sure how that would work 2.)  Cannot talk, no tells, no visible says, 
perhaps "dragon masters" would be able to communicate with them...this 
could be tied in with a quest.  Or dragon Masters could be a sister guild. 
3.)  No weapons, u r a fucking dragon,,,dragonbreath etc.... 4.)  No armor, 
dragonscales etc..... 5.) 500 million to max guild,,,,just make it way 
hardcore. 6.)  because of the high exp needed, the power the dragons 
control would be extreme, when they near the guild max,  I'm talking like 5 
rounding mondar, deathmaster etc... So that's my idea for the dragon 
guild.....the 5 dragon limit could be changed to allow more dragons to 
exist, but i feel that if you made it hard to get in, not many would walk 
that path. I would think of the dragon guild as more like a mob, and not a 
player.  They serve as a background in this game, they have no pk flag, 
anyone can attack them, and they can attack any pk player. Also they would 
be immune to any non-teleport room...They are dragons! With the dragon 
masters they would be immune to the dragons attacks once guild maxed.  They 
have little power alone but when they control their dragon they are 
untouchable.  They would be able to understand what the dragons 
say...etc.... There are problems with this,,,,how many times would they be 
logged in at the same time? etc.. more ideas i have

one guild------> WeaponsMaster Open page here i guess.  Was thinking can 
use guild weps etc...but the true specialty of the WeaponsMaster is to 
create his own arsenal! No spells, just specials, or many multiple attacks 
There would be no guild levels,,,just ranks,  with each rank they master 
another weapons technique.  First rank they would be able to build a 
standard sword, they gain no guild expreience while wielding a non guild 
weapon. Total of 10 ranks i guess. second rank gives another attack 
technique with the standard sword the other ranks expand the weapons that 
you can make, as well as how you can use them. The cool part of this is the 
individual creativity allowed.  The wepons can be customized to an extent, 
and the techniques can be selected from a huge list. I'm not sure if this 
has been done before, I haven't been in every guild.  Word.

Subj: Tribal Guild Idea

Date: Sep 19 08:30

The theme is based of the totem spirits as well as the earth. they call 
upon the totems as well as nature to guide them along their path. Questing 
to seek their fullfilment in life as an adult in the knowledge of their 
ways. They constantly seek power within the spirits of the totems and 
earth. using animal friends and  their own armor and weapons made by 
themselves as their only strength against the outside world.

Just a thought here, if I may.....by comparison to all other current

requires pk to be set. I'd like to petition or something to get either the 
NeoSymbiotes re-implemented, or if not at least a serious power boost for 
normal Symbiotes. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way. Let me

Hrm...when I logged in on saturday afternoon,  
something triggered my guild_divide command and

far I had to go to level 41.  Anyhow...1,900,000

on Sunday morning, I am level 39 again! Jeesh.

Verte demoted Katya today to L19. It was his decision but i'm in 
full support of it. We've seen the subversion she's pulled off in 
the past and she hasn't really put the brakes on it. 
 
Right now part of her agenda (when she's not keeping a tight leash 
on Gogeta) is seeding doubt towards other wizards on here. 
 
For example this is the kind of crap that's happening (in game):

tell angel well its not like it matters he'd still help, he demoted Katya because of earwax then removed all the files that she had in her private directories, because she couldnt have them at L30, but if she was L40 she could.. it was extremely lame.. so i got tired of the bull shit...

Inbetween lucid moments when i'm not doing homework from classes, 
I've been leafing through old notes I drew up from long before I  
had even started questing about a guild.  Granted just have a theme 
for them hammered roughly out now, but as time rolls on and some 
of my classes drone on and on i'll get more stuff thought out. 
 
SO far: The name - Berzerkers/Skull-Takers/Slaughterers 
Theme: A savage barbaric sect of futuristic warriors who have 
all but fallen from their once noble beginnings to be nothing 
more then piratical reavers that follow the tenents of a dark 
and eternally thirsting god of blood.  They disdain all weapons 
but the axe and sword - better to take ones head and be 
drenched in the blood of your foes.  They collect the heads of 
their foes and mount them on trophy racks carried about, which 
gains them the attention of their dark patron.  They also harvest 
organs from the fallen and incorporate them in ritual defilement for 
eventual implantation in their bodies which give them more strength. 
The nurse a total and complete hatred of all life and also hate 
any and all magic users and spells as the worse of the kind. 
Killing a spellcaster (mage, BCM etc.) garners them more favor 
in the eyes of their god.  They lack the mag attrib, but 
have a new attrib of 'rage' which powers their abilities. 
They also are dependant on pie as it allows commune with 
their god.  Str and Sta are maxed at 40 and Rage is  
determined by str. 
Don't have any abilities worked out yet, but will soon.

Ok, she has a save file, isn't banned, didn't leave, didn't really do

see her on, clone her a copy of /players/eurale/VAMPIRES/vampob.c and 
make a note in your wizlog. That should be enough for her to be back in. 
 
I don't know if her guild levels will carry over or not, but right now the 
vampires are second only to the polys in easy guild levels. Remember when 
getting to lvl 19 was actually difficult. 
 
I fixed the vampire guild board for new posts to have the right year, but 
haven't had time to dl'd the save file, replace the old dates, and upload 
it again. Editting a .o file online is just a receipe for disaster and

I agree with what you have written. I think it is something to help push 
Nirvana in the right direction [the future] as well as provide a more 
comprehensive/cohesive approach to character management. 
 
I think #'s 2/3/4 could just be combined into "Transfer/Distribute Points" 
 
For the "mail" and "news" options, would that be accessed without a 
player actually logging in? Just trying to clarify. Also might be good 
to set up each of the characters with a #, so you can play 1, play 3 
etc. or just have another number at the top "#. Logon (select character 
from list)"

I want to make it clear from the beginning, this is not an ultimatum or a  
threat or anything else, it's simply what's going to happen.  It's not  
something new, I decided this a while ago, but didn't want to put myself 
in a position where it would happen.   
 
I'm, quite frankly, just tired of going through the same old pattern of  
getting motivated, trying to get things done, and ending up just moving  
laterally.  If we're going to move forward, which should be the goal, then  
we should be doing so actively.  This really hasn't been the case for a  
long time.  I'm speaking of the LDMUD project of course. 
 
In order to progress, we need to get the playtesting and bugfixing done.   
This means we have to get the players over there somehow, playing and the  
devs over there, fixing.  I've done some cheerleading and prodding in that,  
and that's something that's not my strong-suit, I started with the points  
and rewards thing, but, in the end, I'd have to code every bit of it, and  
probably have to do all the documentation for it as well, and that's just  
too big of a job for one person, just for something to give incentives for  
people to playtest and debug the new driver.   
 
I'm sick of talking about it, sick of defending it, or trying to push  
people into working on it, I'm sick of feeling that I look like a complete  
idiot chasing a Quixotic pipe-dream, and I'm sick of the ups and downs of  
thinking, well, this time we'll get it done, etc; it hasn't happened  
yet, and I doubt it will. 
 
I came back here after this last absence earlier than intended.  I had  
been told about the mysql being added, which of course, makes me say to 
myself, wow, finally some initiative by someone; in addition, you're all 
full of motivation about it: in a week, we'll go live, yadda yadda... 
over a day and a half later, absolutely nothing has been done yet.  There 
isn't so much as a post on the board or news, but the same stupid sign 
to go vote - for a mud that can't retain newbies - is running.  And the 
work being done is a new guild.  That's what I refer to as moving  
laterally rather than forward.   
 
I sent mails and tells to you earlier, you weren't idle, but ignoring me,  
this isn't an indictment, it's an explanation of how I'm seeing things. 
With the manpower we have now on the wiz end, we should already be moving  
forward, and it's not happening.  If it can't now, it never will.  I'm not 
interested in maintaining the status quo or going through this again.  I  
want to work on code for the future, not to frustrate myself with going  
through the same crap over and over, and looking like a fool while doing  
so - I make myself look like a fool too many other ways.   
 
I'll give this until at least Saturday, or Monday if there's improvement, 
but for now, I'm pretty much considering this the end of my time here as a 
wiz.  I have loved coding and bs'ing and playing here, but I need to   
either be able to move forward, or move on.  The going around in circles 
just frustrates me, and that's no good for anyone.

over a day and a half later, absolutely nothing has been done yet.  There 
isn't so much as a post on the board or news, but the same stupid sign 
to go vote - for a mud that can't retain newbies - is running.  And the 
work being done is a new guild.  That's what I refer to as moving  
laterally rather than forward.   
 
I sent mails and tells to you earlier, you weren't idle, but ignoring me,  
this isn't an indictment, it's an explanation of how I'm seeing things. 
With the manpower we have now on the wiz end, we should already be moving  
forward, and it's not happening.  If it can't now, it never will.  I'm not 
interested in maintaining the status quo or going through this again.  I  
want to work on code for the future, not to frustrate myself with going  
through the same crap over and over, and looking like a fool while doing  
so - I make myself look like a fool too many other ways.   
 
I'll give this until at least Saturday, or Monday if there's improvement, 
but for now, I'm pretty much considering this the end of my time here as a 
wiz.  I have loved coding and bs'ing and playing here, but I need to   
either be able to move forward, or move on.  The going around in circles 
just frustrates me, and that's no good for anyone.

Subj: That last mail

Date: Oct 25 02:52

Feel free to forward it to anyone you want, I don't want there to be 
any confusion over this, as it's permanent.  The last time I said  
that sober was the last time I played or coded on my other mud... 
I'll perhaps play occasionally, perhaps not, don't want to commit 
to that, but my choice is very clear: I don't want to continue the 
way things have been, I'm not going to, so the situation must change 
either by progressing, or by me moving on.  It's been a lot of fun, 
I count you among my friends here of course, but I can't keep doing 
this.

has issues with gogeta...apparently gogeta and whoa used to have a 
thing, and whoa is brian's ex, and he only logs to see if whoa is on 
and to harass brian....temporarily sitebanned him last night because 
mon 
I happened to catch some of it, undid it when I went to bed, he's a 
level 4 or some crap with an ip i haven't seen before, anyways, I 
didn't see a point to dealing with it so just banned the ip for a  
couple hours, figure let someone else figure on how to handle it if 
it continues, can always reban by uncommenting lines 310-322 or 
thereabouts in player.c

Subj: Shard ideas

Cc: earwax, vital
Date: Nov  2 11:39

I was thinking it would be cool to have an autoload or some other shard 
specific eq that would give us a constant lord of evil alignment.  I was 
also thinking it would be cool as hell to have a guild level 9.  This guild 
level gives you the level of 666 on all who screens, as well as some sort 
of additional attack or special.  One idea i had was to be able to take the 
shape of shardakbion during battle, or be able to transform for a period of 
time.  This would lend super strength and higher WC.  Otherwise I had the 
idea that we could summon a shadow, shardak's shadow, kind of like an extra 
pet, it lends attacks and AC bonuses.  Just a thought, but I really think 
the 666 lvl is cool as hell.  Could make glvl 9 worth like 30 million or 
something outrageous.  Hell, I'd do it!! Just some ideas.   BTW...I would 
like to see more themed weapons and armors.  I hate the fact that everyone 
is using the same eq all the time.  I am willing to help if there is 
anything I can do.  I don't know how to code, and I'm sure Wax is sick of 
listening to me by now;) But whatever.

My son, Michael has moved back home for  
a time, and so will be logging into the 
game from my ip.  We don't usually play or 
party together...nor do we usually trade items 
back and forth.  At any rate, he has his chars 
and I have mine, and most know who they are  
in both cases. If anyone ever has any 
questions about who is logged in...all they 
need do is ask.

I couldnt help but notice that Katya said something to the effect that 
she "never talked to mizan" or "never said you were stalking me", or even 
that she "did not know how mizan" got sucked into it. 
 
If you are interested, though i have no idea what purpose they would 
serve other than to piss you off a bit, i have IM logs of her conversations 
as well as what she said to me on here about the whole matter. Again, i'm 
thinking that this would probably only annoy you but in the grand scheme 
of things, it might be just what you needed right about now. 
 
LMK if you're interested.
