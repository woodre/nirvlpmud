"Starting from scratch has prevented MUDs from advancing significantly
 since the early 1980's.... MUD authors are unwilling to use the work
 of others.... future MUD authors will throw away [previous] work
 because it isn't complete and will...have the same problem.

 And so MUD libraries will remain awful because nobody is willing to put
 more than 6 months of hard effort into a 5-10 year job."
