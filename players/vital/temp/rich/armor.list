Recommended armour classes.
Types other than "armor" should not have a class higher than 1.
If you adjust the price for an item, put something in the long description that might
indicate to the players it is more/less valuable.
Ex:  Plate armor with a rampant lion inlaid in gold on the chest.  Worth 1700.
