Command: sponsor <name>
 
    Sponsor a player so that he/she may join the Templars.
You must be guild rank 6 or above to sponsor new members,
and have discussed it previously with other knights. Make
sure you investigate the person you are sponsoring, it
reflects on your judgement. Also, if you are the person
wishing to bring someone into the guild, first show and
explain to them the tablet(they can look but not read it,
so it is up to you to explain to them the code). Next,
go up from the main hall of the knights and add their name
to the board. Then it will be a 3 day wait. It requires a
total of 3 knights of guild rank 6 or above to fully admit
someone into the guild.
