From this point on, all matters that deal with the knights
code of honor and how you should act can be read at the
templar arch room.  You will notice a tablet that lists
each code, and has additional information available. If
you have any comments/suggestions/questions, then please
talk to any experienced Knight, Dragnar, or Maledicta.
                        Thank you.
