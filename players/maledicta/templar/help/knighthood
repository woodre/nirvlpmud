  As a Templar Knight you are expected to follow the rules
outlined in the tablet located at the Templar arch. Also,
you will be expected to retain a good alignment at ALL times.
Failure to do so will result in punishment. You will need
to donate coins in order to continue using your powers. All
donations, whether they be items or coins, can be made at
the donation room in the Templar Castle. 

  If you have any questions, please contact Dragnar/Maledicta,
  or any experienced Knight.
