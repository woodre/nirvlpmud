2.   [1;33mJericho[2;37;0m [1m: [2;37;0m[1;33mThere are many that might consider themselves to be a warrior within these vast realms.  Few though can compare to a warrior born such as Jericho.  I dedicate this plate of Honor for the warrior's valor, courage, and boldness.  Jericho has aided and saved my life many times while being attacked by those of no honor.  To this warrior born I salute you ![2;37;0m (daredevil)
3.   [1;33mDrkwngdck[2;37;0m [1m: [2;37;0m[1;33mDrkwngdck is a hero of the utmost caliber.  Always willing to lend a hand even when his might was not as great, and constantly braving incredible odds to assist an ally or knight in peril.  He may not be the strongest or the biggest, but his bravery wins any day's fight.  And he is a truly great friend.[2;37;0m (tristram)
4.   [1;33mDrkwngdck[2;37;0m [1m: [2;37;0m[1;33mI would like to give honor to a great ally Drkwngdck.  Drkwngdck sat in the waste lands with Ghost and I waiting for the attack from symbio, subotai, and vortex.  We were attacked and when the dust settled subotai was dead.  Not a bad first pk for a great ally.  I salute you ![2;37;0m (daredevil)
