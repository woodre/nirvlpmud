1.   [1;33mTristram[2;37;0m [1m: [2;37;0m[1;33mI would like to honor Tristram for the spirit he has brought into the Elite ranks.  He is my right hand I do not believe the Elite would have been such a success as it has been.  I would talk about how much of a fearless fighter he is but we all know that.  I honor his courage, fearlessness, and ability to act wisely in all situations.  It would be an honor to die for him.  I salute you.[2;37;0m (daredevil)

Fawkes taught me the meaning of being a Knight when I joined, and the Elite owes a great deal to his knowledge and power.  I am proud to call him my brother.[2;37;0m (tristram)
