		-=[ Punishment ]=-


    Punishment will occur when a knight has broken
any of the laws set down by the tablet.  Punishment
can be anything from a task/quest for redemption, a
suspension of powers, or even expulsion from the
guild.  It is up to the Guild Wizard present to
decide.  From now on, the rule of thumb will be
three strikes and you are out of the guild. This will
apply to minor offenses.  One major will still have
you removed.
