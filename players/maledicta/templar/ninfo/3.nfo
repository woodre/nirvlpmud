		-=[ Rule 3 ]=-


If one should fall upon hard times, be ready to assist
in any way possible.  Aid those who are unfortunate
enough not to enjoy your skills.
Assist Newbies with coins, party time, equipment, or
information whenever you can.  Remember that this
assistance will be paid back at a later date.
