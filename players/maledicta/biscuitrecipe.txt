2 cups Bisquick baking mix 
1 3/4 cup finely shredded cheddar cheese 
2/3 cups milk 
2 tablespoons butter, melted and divided 
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 
1/2 teaspoon fine parsley flakes 

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
2. Combine baking mix, 1 cup of the cheddar cheese, milk, 
and 1 half of the melted butter in a medium bowl.
Mix by hand until well-combined.
3. Separate out the dough into several small round lumps.
4. Sprinkle the parsley over the top of the dough. Be sure 
the dried parsley flakes are crushed fine. You can easily 
crush the flakes in a small bowl with your thumb and forefinger.
5. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the dough – leave a small margin around the edge. 
6. Bake for 14-16 minutes or until the cheese on top begins to slightly brown. 
7. Combine the remaining butter with the garlic powder and brush it over the top 
of the bake as soon as it comes out of the oven.
