      has one purchasable effect. By paying 1000 coins a
      player can change their title to anything they
      desire. There are warnings that abusing this will
      lead to punishment. I thought this was a good touch
      and would make it so players would start leaving 
      wizzes alone about changing their title.

Item:                  Description:
FirstAid Kit      This heal is made more for newbies, and such is higher doses
                  with less effect. 9 doses, for 18 points of healing hp&sp.
                  with a tox rate that is divided between stuffed and soaked
                  for a total of 6. Cost is 1800 coins. 200 coins per dose.

Medical Kit       Heal that includes 2 types. stuff, and soak. Heals for
                  40 + random(20) hit points only. rate of 4 stuff, 4 soak.
                  3 uses. Cost is figured by toxamount(8)*3 = 24 divided by
                  heal total of 40 normal and 20 random = .14 tox amount
                  = 20 per point. 20*120 normal= 2400 + 60*7 random points
                  = 420. Total is 2820. Divided by 2/3 for healing only one
                  type = 1782. rounded up for a cost of: 1950 coins. 650 per
                  dose.

Shot large        Sobers for -15 intox, 3 uses. Cost is 900 coins.

Shot small        Sobers for -15 intox, 1 use. Cost is 300 coins.
                  
VibroSword        wc 16 sword. Weight is 2 and special of 20% for 4 damage.
                  Cost is 1500 coins. Saveable.       

VibroAxe          wc 17 axe. Weight is 3 and special is 20% for 5 damage.
                  Cost is 2200 coins. Saveable.

BlasterPistol     This is a high ticket item that costs 50000 coins, with each clip
                  selling for 1500, and lasting 500 rounds which make the wc of the
                  wep 18 while loaded. Special damage depends on charges existing
                  in the item and can do random(6)+8 damage on a 30% chance, or do
                  5 on a 60% chance(NOTE: Both cannot go off at the same time.).
                  Each special will eat up more charges, 3 additional for the larger,
                  and 1 for the smaller, with normal combat constantly using 1 
                  charge. When the weapons charges run out the wc drops to 5. With
                  its extreme cost and need for charges I have made it saveable. 
                  This item is repairable only in the shop it is purchased in.

BlasterRifle      Much like the blaster pistol, this item is high cost 70k, and its
                  cost 1200 each and last 1000 charges. The wc of this weapon is 
                  also 18 when charged, and drops to 6 when not charged. The special
                  for this weapon is a base range of 1-8 with an additional 3 damage
                  times 1-4 attacks, with a max total of 20(RARE). Each special
                  attack will use 4 charges. With its extreme cost and necessary
                  charges, i have made it saveable.
                  This item is repairable only in the shop it is purchased in.
                         
Clip [blaster pistol] Gives 500 charges to a blaster pistol. Can force a clip in
                      if the weapon is getting low on charges, will waste the

______________________________[MOBS AND STATS]________________________________

Shop owners:  All shop owners carry the same stats, level 5, hp:75, wc:9
              ac: 5. This includes the weapon, armor, heal owners, as well
              as the clerk and bartender.
              
Guards:  Guards range in power, and are randomly made different ranks 
         upon creation. Ranks and power are:
         Rank:         Level: Wc: Ac: Coins:            Special damage(chance):
    (40%)Private        14    22   9  Random500+1000     random25+10 (25%)

         There are 13 guard files, each exactly the same as the next. The 
         reason for the separate files is so later each guard can be
         individually controlled and given instructions from the jedi's
         tower, to perform guard duties and such around the city. Each 
         guard will attack anyone who attacks another guard within their
         prescence. Not all 13 guards are in use at the moment, but will
         be used after the guild hall is complete.
         
Civilians: Civilians are done the same as guards, they are randomly chosen
           upon creation, with varying chances for each to be chosen.

      Droid IV is a street cleaner that picks up items much like the 
      cities garbageman. All civilian types move slightly differently
      than set_move_at_reset(), and use another type that moves them
      every 20 hbs, this gives a feeling of the city being busy, etc.
      The Doona tradesman carries the Wrist blade noted above in items.
