Quality Check 5/26 - Eurale
  I've gone through the entire area and I must say it was most impressive.
You did a nice job of thinking through the area theme and I like the little
twists and turns I ran into.  Here are the things I found that I would like
to either fix or address:

r2 - couldn't look at shadows
r3 - when I look at the shadows, I should get a description of what the shadows
     look like, in the 'light' descript (typo) your->you're
r4 - shelves descript (typo) your->you're, I would suggest lowering the chat
     chance as well... it's very often.
r5 - no floor, no piles
r6 - no film, what do I see when I look at the walls/ceiling?, no stones
r7 - no ashes, no remains, wall/ceiling descriptions should describe them.
r8 - walls (typo) your->you're, floor description?
r9 - no art, no treasures, ankh.. broke->broken
r10- no hallway, when I look in the hole here it says I can do down, do you
     really want a down exit?
r13- no onyx, no engraving, are the marks supposed to be the clue to 'turn'?
r16- no wall
r17- no hallway
r18- symbols?  what do they look like?
r20- symbols (first sen) each.. with each?
r23- floor descript line lengths wrap funny
