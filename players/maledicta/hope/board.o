tmp_text "I have formed the Elite Guard within the Templarknighthood.  It is bound by several of the Knightswho you can pick out from the rest by theirtitle of either Elite Guardsman, or EliteGeneral.  The Generals are in charge of thisspecial branch and will be who you take anyproblems or questions too. All of the Eliteare at your disposal, and all you need do iscall for their assistance by using ahelp. It is their job to respond, and if they do not,then please tell a general or myself.         Thanks,                Maledicta**I would like to give my 2 cents worth.Sylvan..   warriors so far have shown to be powerful and an asset to the alliance..   Since Sylvan has pk, I feel they would make a good member.Ribbit..  I have seen Ribbit some, I do not know what he could bring.  My vote here would be between no and abstain.  He has not shown anything i have seen to be a great asset as of yet.Disturbed..  Just judging by lvl and guild, I would have to say no.  A high level derv (19+) is a great ally, but at lvl 15, he will be limited to making an impact.  I think let em get a few more lvls then reapply.The Astro Ally,Little**     Hail Sword Brothers, it is once again time for me to go over general Allianceinformation for those who are new to the Alliance, and to ask for your input in allmatters.  Lets frist start off with the basics.     If someone contacts you or you know of someone who would make a good additionto the Alliance, please direct them to contact an Ambassador.  (Currently the only activeAmbassador is myself).  The Ambassador(s) will then contact that person and go about theprocess of adding them to the board for discussion.  Certain times the Ambassador(s) will gothrough the current roster of Alliance members and see who is being an active member.The key to this Alliance being powerful, is by having a strong active group, rather than agroup of Allies that we never see or just never work together.  Those that are not beinga productive member will removed from the Alliance until they contact one of theAmbassador(s) with thier intentions of rejoining.  This does not mean that we will justkick you out if you don't log on enough.  Things happen in RL and we understand.     We must always remember that this Alliance of like minded people is only asstrong as you the members make it.  I encourage, beg, and ask you to please letme know what your thoughts are.  If you have a comment, suggestion, flame, etc.. Don't hesitate to contact me.  I don't want to have to make Alliance decisions myself becauseI get no input from it's members.  The Alliance is always a work in progress, and I am proudof how the Alliance is working out thus far. I would die for any Alliance membe      So remember, if you have the chance contact an Ambassador, with comments aboutprospective members, what you think the Alliance should stand for, what is an activemember of the Alliance etc.  I am eager to find out what this great diverse Alliance thinks.In Your Service,--DD**     Hail Sword Brothers,  I just wanted to remind you of two security issues within the TowerOf Hope.  First off, please do NOT bring anyone who is not a knight, or ally into the Tower.The reason is fairly simple, we don't want an enemy sticking around waiting to jump one of us.Secondly, Whiteblade can be hired to attack players in any room coded by Maledicta, this includes theTower of Hope.  So just don't try to idle here unless you are very careful!In Your Service,--DD**     Hail Sword Brothers,  after listening to many Knights and Alliance members, I havedecided to change the way we recruit new members and many of the Alliance procedures.What I am asking of you, is to contact me by mail with any suggestions.  I do notwant to simply make up the rules myself without input.  I am asking for your thoughtson a level requirement for joining, pk requirements, joining requirements in general.I will be away on vacation for a week's time starting Friday night, but I will bechecking in every so often.  So you have a week to flood me with mail!  I believethis is the dawn of a new age for the Alliance and hope you feel justas excited!In Your Service,--DD**Allies!What another beautiful day at the Tower of Hope, basking in thesheer glory of this great Alliance! I would just like to offermy assistance to any Alliance member that may need it. If youneed equipped back up, let me know. Need a corpse returned? Justask. Getting pked? Well hollar and Ill be setting pk as I run toyou! And anyone is welcome to fight along side of me. I just ask one thing, please come prepared. You will be hit occasionally, bring armor and heals. "Great risk yields greater gains."Movin on Up!*==Tyr[=Knight=of=Balance==-**Allies,Subotai broke into the Templar Castle yesterday and got himselfstuck with the mage. Desiree and myself responded to the threatand made him quit out... If you see anyone in the castle that shouldntbe, whack em!*==Tyr=[=Knight=of=Balance==-**     Hail Sword Brothers, please take time to welcome Sylvan, Disturbed, Vistar, Ribbit, and Tarkento the Alliance.  The Alliance will greatly benefit with their additions!--DD**I would just like to express my delight in the new additions to the Alliance. I hope to see you all soon!*=Tyr=[=Knight=of=Balance===-**I am a warrior the heart of a champion beats within my mighty bodyI am a lover the power of my mighty heart brings kindness and understanding to othersI am a fool the aggression of ages has brought me sham and sorrowI am a friend my help shall blanket you in the warmth of comfort and aidI am Goodness may my blade of justice slice through the flesh of my foe and bring end to evilI am not alone I am the alliance and so are you**     Since there seems to be no one else to help out with Alliancequestions, I will still post prospective members for now.  Whoa wouldlike to join the Alliance, please post comments.--DD**I think Whoa would be a great assest to the alliance...she has done nothing but be helpful to me and others..She is truely a good natured player. *Desiree***I will have to say no to Whoa.Today, Whoa was partying with a cyber.  Although it is not illegal to party with cybers, an alliance member (or prospective member) should not be doing so.  I informed Whoa that it was not a good idea to party with cybers.  Here is the conversation:You tell whoa partying with a cyber is not a good thing for someone thatwants to join the alliance.Whoa tells you: oh.. its not?.. i didnt know thatYou tell whoa cybers, shards, vamps are evil.   opposite of what the alliance stands for.Whoa tells you: oh i see..okay.. sorry.After this conversation, Whoa continued to party with someone that he knew would not be favorable to him.Myself, Cooper, and Sting have witnessed this.Vistar**i have also seen whoa partying with a cyber just thought i would give my two cents on itmorpheus**I have already expressed my feelings to Daredevil regarding my desirefor him to remain an active member of the Alliance, so I won`t repeatthem all here for public consumption.  However, I will respect what-ever path he chooses to take.  In the event that he decides to leavethe Alliance completely, I will assume the role of Ambassador.  Pleaseforward requests to me concerning prospective allies or simply and Alliance-related questions and concerns should this come to pass.  TheAlliance is great for 2 reasons.  One, what it is: a great coalition oflike-minded people who strive for a common cause.  Two, the potential itholds to be a dominant force for good throughout Nirvana.  Help us unlockthis potential and expand the Alliance.SALUTEStone**I came upon an issue that I would like to get some ally input about.Last night a cyber died in the ruins.  He had a high level cyber that was with him and was forced to quit out.  I went to the room he died, killed 2 aggro monsters and took as much as I could carry before the high level came back in to get the rest.Here is my issue.  The cyber, obviously not happy, told me that what I did was wrong and he was going to have me removed from the alliance.  This was completely unacceptable to me.  The high level cyber had no issues and stayed out of the conversation.Here was my reasoning:1. My reason for joining the alliance was to eliminate evil in any way possible across the mud.  By getting the stuff from an evil person, I am reducing his future effect to destroy good for a period of time.2. I had no involvement in his death, and only took what I could get before the high level was able to get back to get whatever was remaining.I gave everything that I obtained to a knight that was on to use/sell/donate to the guild.  The cyber continued to express his discontent vulgerly to me.  The knight then gave one of the weapons that I got back to the cyber. Is this a common occurance?   Myself and another ally that was on told the knight this is not a good thing.I would like anyones opinion on this issue.  I will continue to conduct myself in the manner that my guild and the alliance require.  Taking stuff from the corpse of an evil player I feel is no crime.Vistar.   Ally Monk**As far as I can see, you did the right thing by attempting toharm Evil in whatever way you possibly can.  Your guild, thewarriors, have no rules against corpse looting, and thereforeyou are well within your rights to do so.  Now, here is my question:Was the cyberninja you took the items from a criminal?If so, this wonderful knight that gave a weapon to thiscyberninja will be severely punished for their unbelievablestupidity.  Keep up the good work, and hurt them however you can.Oh, and when a criminal/cyber/anyone gets flappy with you:check out help tellblock, or just ignore them.  They haveno right to dictate any rules to you.  If they have a problem,they can look up our judge advocates, or other higher rankedTemplars.  Ignore the fools.  Hurt the fools.                             - Maledictap.s. This is a message to the allies of the Templars, not tothe knights themselves.  Your rules are in full effect.**Like the title says, read Maledicta`s p.s. in the previous note.  While Vishtar did nothing wrong, anyone caught looting corpses who is a member of the Knights Templar will be punished.SALUTEStone**Hallo Knights & Allies,If anyone has some logs of the goblin wars, I would greatly appreciate getting in touch with you. Also, any tidbits of memories that you may have from fighting in it would be appreciated as well.Faithfully yours,~Breezy**i have talked with whoa concerning the partying with cybers and whoa told me that it wouldnt happen again and i havent seen her doing anything wrong here of late and i partied with her last night and she was of great help to me and i think she is a very good person and would be a great addition to the alliance. sincerly your brotherly knightmorpheusps that is just my two cents worth**In the days of when I was a child, I remember how the now fabled warriors were. Their platemail was not always gleaming and strength not always unyielding. They bled red and cried the same tears as you or I.  Most of all, I recall how they stood for a chosen cause. On the foggy coastal plains of Nirvana, many brave warriors fought for the causes of good and held evils at bay. My mind rests on the war between the invading goblin armies and the Knights Templar with their Allies. 	The sun rarely shone through those stormy clouds and the land seemed wrapped in a blanket of darkness. The very wind itself seemed to howl in anguish as it blew over those goblin and ogre ridden shores. These armies were building and churning, waiting for the right moment to break through and storm Nirvana, pillaging and killing as they went. The time was ripe for the land to plunge into an era of darkness and turmoil.	It was decided that the Knights and Allies would stand up and bind together, forming a wall through which no evil could pass. So warriors took up their weapons and others offered their own special skills in any way they could. Healers would heal, and non-combatants would provide a steady flow of resources and encouragement. Those lands became a proving ground for the Knights and their Allies. Rifts that were once tearing began to close and many new lasting bonds were formed. 	The first hours of battle tested their strength, quick reflexes and endurance. Assassins trained by the goblin armies were sent out to murder Knights, Allies and unwarily townsfolk. These dark forms would creep into any unlocked nook or cranny that held an ounce of valor. Knights stood watch in the castle order to protect their resting brothers and sisters. Justin was one of the many that guarded the castle from intruders and fought those who dared risk falling under his deadly blade. The Knights quickly realized they must drive the invaders into the sea and back to their own unknown land.	A host of Templar Knights with their Allies led by Stone stormed the northwestern front as a small entourage led by Ghost attacked at the southwestern end. Not knowing how vast the goblin armies had grown, the two divisions had planned to split the opposing forces and meet in the middle. As the battle progressed, it became clear that Ghost and Pino needed to regroup with the main campaign. Hordes of goblins and ogres had surged around them, preventing safe passage to return. It was hard and some even say that Ghost fell under the blade of the goblins only to come back to the living and continue on. Finally, after much battle, they reconvened with the larger party and began to fight again. Together they found that they could defeat the goblin invasion. 	Hours of bloodshed turned into days and still the fierce sounds of battle rang throughout the land. Yet even in the days that followed morale continued to rise and more and more people stood up to assist these brave warriors in their cause. People remembered the days of old when the guild of Templar Knights stood proud and unified. They began to speak the names that were being written in history like Stone, Jarana, Whitedawn, Ghost, Daredevil, Beowulf, Cooper, Little, and so many others.**Slowly as the week progressed the huge army of 8,200 ogres and goblins were beaten back and only two strongholds remained. The Knights and Allies had finally reached the goblin base camp and the cave of the red dragon clan. The dragon king, Falesgauntriax, King of the Reds, had allied himself with the goblins and was prepared to fight. A short council was held and it was decided that the dragons were a greater threat and a band of warriors set out to invade the cave. Once inside, they were met by onslaughts of darklings and numerous minor dragons. Finally, they reached the massive dragon. The air in the royal cavern reeked of sulfur and the beasts soft underbody was encrusted with jewels. Unwillingly to turn back and give up after coming so far, they bravely faced him. Flames singed and burned; smoke made it hard to breathe and yet after the air cleared, the mighty dragon king lay defeated. 	A promise of victory was on the mind of every individual who participated in those long battles. Only one windy tent stood between them and then they could restore the peace of Nirvana. Again the forces regrouped to plan the siege on the base camp. Together, the Knights with their Allies stormed the lonely stronghold and defeated the enemies outside of the tent. Inside, however, lay Garshlog, King of the Goblins decked out in pounds of jewels and an uncountable number of robes. Garshlog was huge, tall, very, very obese, ugly, and smelled of a mix of rotten eggs, rancid pork, and two month old pizza. Stone led the attack and fought bravely with his brothers and sisters. Even the King of the Goblins could not stand up to the Knights with their Allies and with a loud, reverberating thud, he crashed to the ground, dead. 	Tired and worn, the Knights and Allies stood united in victory. What remained of the goblin army dissipated into darker realms or was killed. Only a small clan of defeated Red Dragons remained hidden deep within their caves. 	Rumors had been spreading like wildfire that the late King had somehow found the mighty sword Excalibur and kept it with him at all times. Whispers said that it was hidden in his personal tent. Stone spotted a hidden treasure room and found the mighty sword Excalibur hidden in a treasure chest. The magnificent sword once wielded by King Arthur was presented to Stone in honor of his leadership, skill, and many other attributes on the battlefield.	Silence washed over the land as the sounds of the fierce battle fell quiet. The invading armies had been defeated and their strongholds were destroyed. The coastal plains lay soaked in blood and chaos. Something needed to be built in order for no enemy to get so close to overrunning the land of Nirvana again. Not merely a watchtower, but a new Templar stronghold that could stand up to such opposing forces. 	It was decided that with the wealth earned off of the defeated soldiers would build a castle to prevent invaders from getting so close again and keep watch on the cave of the dragons. This castle would become the new home for the Knights Templar and would be welcome to their Allies at all times. Not long after this, Fortress Stone stood proud overlooking the vast oceans to the west. Its thick walls could withstand any siege and the test of time.	Slowly, people came to the fortress and built up a small town. This grew into a booming port-city eventually, which they named New Ares. Shops, inns, and taverns sprung up and with this more people arrived. They told tales of a time that was now passed of gleaming platemail and unyielding strength. Even now, people still rejoice when they hear about the warriors that fought for them, and will forever.Many thanks to the brave warriors who fought for this land and the wizards that help guide them. This historic event was captured topaper by Breezy the Bard.**Allies,Yates has expressed interest in joining the alliance. I putt my fullsupport behind the Gray Knight.

I really do not like the idea of playerstaking a group of someone characters and not allowing them to play eachcharacter individually.  Things like speaking to them about matters thatdo not pertain to that character, but another character they play.  Treating them in a manor suited for a different character they play.Even giving information out of character, can sometimes be very annoying.All I'm asking is that you guys be a little careful about things of thisnature as it might not bother you, to talk to someone about another characterof yours; but it might bother someone else when you talk to them about another character of theirs.-J**When I logged on today, every guard in the fortress was dead and the gates were destroyed!Please remember to "cdonate" excess cash and equipment,Allies can use this command as well.
