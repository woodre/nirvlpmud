new_text "     Hail Sword Brothers, I just wanted to remind you that you should not ever partywith a cyberninja, vampire, or shardak.  I personally have never partied with either of themand support this rule 100%.  Furthermore, if I see or hear of any Elite knight partying or helping a cyberninja in anyway, you WILL be removed from Elite status.  Therewill be no second chances or warnings.  I know that this will not  be a problem with any of you Elite because I have 100% confidence in all of you.--DD"

tmp_text "Please feel free to use this board as you see fitfor anything that deals with the elite.         Thanks,                Maledicta**     Hail Sword Brothers, the following is just a couple quick reminders for thosewho did not catch them before.Questing - Because of all the potential problems with Elite knights questing and           not being able to perform thier duties 100%, from now on any Elite that           decides they want to start questing, should make sure to mail myself or           any other General.  We will then remove you from the Elite guard.           No hard feelings, this is just to stop future problems/conflict of interests.           Remember being an Elite knight is a choice and a privledge with many           duties and costs.Titles - Keep your keep your title set as an Elite at all times.  Allies cannot         tell who is elite and who is not elite, as well as the rest of the mud if         you do not have your title set to Elite.  Showing our numbers formally         makes us feared by the mud.  When they see elite, they know they will         be attacked if they are evil.  Criminals seem fewer and fewer these days         and I believe it has something to do with the respect, whether that be out         of fear or out of honor, we Elite are bringing to the realms and this guild.Death/PK - I have noticed that some of us have fallen in the line of duty.  This happens           to warriors in battle.  What matters is that you get back up and set your pk         again.  We would rather see an Elite fight with honor and courage, then to         watch one only go through the motions of trying to rid the realms of evil.         This does not mean that you must do a suicide attempt when you are seriously         outnumbered.  It just means that you should give 100% all the time.Criminals - Make sure you watch over the records on the criminal list.  Take a look            at the note in the main guild board Maledicta has put up.  I don't want criminals         getting off easy for thier misdeeds.Inactivity - If you do plan on going inactive, and still want to be an Elite when             you come back, please drop myself or another General a note about it.      Remember if you ever have a problem, especially if it involves another knight,contact myself of any other General..  I consider us to be the best of the best.The example of what all knights should be.  You are all doing well.--DD**     Hail Sword Brothers, I just wanted to remind you that you should not ever partywith a cyberninja, vampire, or shardak.
