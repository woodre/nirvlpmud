I was going inactive because I wanted to code my area on a different mud.  I fucked up on that pk.  I wanted to press a totally different macro, but instead, i hit the wrong one, and the one i hit spams a bunch of stuff.  I don't die in pk like that unless there's a freak accident, there's one.		Akarra tells you: if you think that is going to get me kicked out you are sadly mistaken.Akarra, I don't want this to kick you out.  I want you to stop acting like you know everything cause you don't, you know nothing about me or what goes on in my head.I'm going inactive i guess.  hmm..
