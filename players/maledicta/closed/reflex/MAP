Special Rooms:

main.c - This is where you put the commander of the army.  
	 THe room is darkened by fog, and requires a minimum
	 of 8 moves to reach.  Of course that assumes that a
	 player knows he is there.

plains1.c - This is be beginning of the open plains and is
	    where you should place the serious opposition and
	    bulk of the army.  Rooms in the plains are 3D, and
	    as a result movement is fully free in all 8 
	    directions(n,s,e,w,ne,nw,se,sw) except where a dir
	    is blocked explicitly in the description.

mount_ent.c/mount_ents1.c - This is the mountains, harrassing
	troops should be here, but this is not where the bulk
	of the army should be.  Your call of course.

pass.c/pass_ent.c - This is the edge of the border, and where
	both goblins and Knights will have to pass in order to
	get in or out of the plains.  Lots of good ideas roam
	around my head for this paticuliar bottleneck...

path.c - Entrance to the realm, this is designed to connect to
	 the western edge of the mud.
