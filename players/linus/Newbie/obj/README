I've made all of the "animal parts" barter-able at my castle object
"Hank the trader".  The values are all the same as in the original README
pertaining to the objects, when bartered.  They're a little lower if sold
in a shop to encourage players to use the barter feature.  I felt it would
add a little theme to the area.
