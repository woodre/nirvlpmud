The area is based on Winnie the Pooh and Friends.  I must add that it 
probably is not 100% accurate, but should still provide some fun for
newbies and low level players...which the area is intended for.
A Map of the area and summary of the files follows:

Key: 
  [ ] = room
   #  = room number "/players/linus/Newbie/room/n#.c"
   -  = horizontal direction
   |  = verticle direction
