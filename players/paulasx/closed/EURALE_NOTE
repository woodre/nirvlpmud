  I made some changes in your quest so that the old cheat sheets about it
would not be accurate.  Specifically, I closed the east exit of temple_nw and
the west exit of temple_ne.  They must fight the dragon and mage to get to
the altar room.  From Damian I switched the north exit to 'hell/hell1' and from
the altar north you'll go to 'final_room'.  Nothing big, just that they have
to look now rather than run through it.
  If you have any question or want more detailed info, you can look in
/log/EURALE_WORKREPORT.  I left your code in with comments around it so you
could see what/where I made changes.  -Eurale 3/15/97
