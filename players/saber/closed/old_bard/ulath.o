song ({"Life in the Fast Lane","He was a hard headed man, he was brutally handsome y'all... she was terminally pretty.","She held him up, and he held her for ransom in the heart of the cold, cold, city...","He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude.. they said he was ruthless, they said he was crude...","They had one thing in common... they were good in bed, she said 'Faster, Faster.. the lights are turning red..","Life in the fast lane... surely make you lose your mind....  Life in the fast lane...","Eager for action, hot for their game, the coming attraction, the drop of a name...","They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills..","They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills...","There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face..","She preteneded not to notice, she was caught up in her race...","Out in the evening, until it was light, he was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it...","Life in the fast lane... surely make you lose your mind....  Life in the fast lane...","Life in the fast lane... everything.. all the time... Life in the fast lane...","Goin' and burnin', blinded by thirst...they didn't see the stop sign took a turn for worst...","She said 'Listen Baby, you can here them engines ring, We've been up and down this highway haven't seen a goddamn thing'...","He said 'Call the doctor, I think I'm gonna crash...' The doctor says he's comin' but you got to pay him cash..","Went rushing down that freeway, messed around and got lost.. they didn't know, they were just dying to get off and it was..","Life in the fast lane... surely make you lose your mind....  Life in the fast lane...","Life in the fast lane... everything.. all the time... Life in the fast lane...","Life the fast lane...
