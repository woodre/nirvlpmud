song ({"Dead man's party","I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go","Walkin' with a dead man over my shoulder","Waiting for an invitation to arrive","Goin' to a party where no-one's still alive","I was struck by lightning","Walkin' down the street","I was hit by something last night in my sleep","It's a dead man party","Who could ask for more","Everybody's comin', leave your body at the door","Leave your body and soul at the door","(Don't run away it's only me)","All dressed up with nowhere to go","Walkin' with a dead man","Waitin' for an invitation to arrive","With a dead man... Dead man...","Got my best suit and my tie","Shiny silver dollar on either eye","I hear the chauffeur comin' to the door","Says there's room for just one more","I was struck by lighting","Walkin' down the street","I was hit by something last night in my sleep","It's a dead man's party","Who could ask for more","Everybody's comin', leave your body at the door","Leave your body and soul at the door...","Don't run away it's only me","Don't be afraid of what you can't see","Don't run away it's only me","What if God Smoked Cannabis","What if God had long hair/ And a Goatee","And his eyes were pretty glazed","If he looked spaced out","Would you buy his story?","Would you believe he had an eye infection?","Yeah, yeah, God looks baked","Yeah, yeah, God smells good","Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah","What if God smoked cannabis?","Hit the bong like some of us?","Drives a tie-dyed microbus?","And he subscribes to \"Rolling Stone\"","If God made this place/ In the beginning","Did he plant any seeds?","Or did he put them there for Adam and Eve","So they'd be hungry for the apple that the snake was alway offering?","Yeah, yeah God rolls great","Yeah, yeah, God smells good","Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah","What if God smoked cannabis?","Do you s'pose he had a buzz","When he made the platypus?","When he created Earth our home?","And do you think he rolls his own","Up there in heaven on the throne?","And when the saints go marching home","Maybe he sits and smokes a bowl.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
