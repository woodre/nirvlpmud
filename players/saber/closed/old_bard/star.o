song ({"Never Say Die","As we stood there older than the men and younger than the boys","We were as still as the wind that blows on a hot August night","And you were lonesome as a jukebox, but deadly just the same","I could be as gentle as a newborn, then spit into the eye of a hurricane","And we knew how to laugh, and we knew how to cry","Yeah we sure knew how to live and we don't ever...","Never say die, Never say die","I guess you'd say we had a pact, these words we knew so well","Still they remained unspoken, and we'd take them to the fiery gates of hell","Once I was afraid of love, but when it's your brother those things change","'Cause love is just another word for trust, so hear me when I say...","Never say die, Never say no","You gotta look them in the eye and don't let go","When it's your own blood you'll bleed, and your own tears you'll cry","When you're brought up to believe that it's the strong who survive","Never say die","And we could run like lightning through the pouring rain","And we'll be standing like a soldier who comes marching home again","They ask what it is that I want written on the gravestone where I'll lie","Tell them it's just my bones that died there, so save the tears they'll cry","My spirit is still riding somewheres in this night","When it's these three words that come to me when I kiss this world goodbye","Never say die, never say no","You gotta look them in the eye and don't let go","When it's your own blood you'll bleed and your own tears you'll cry","When you're brought up to believe that it's the strong who survive","Never say die!",0,0,0,"The Rose","Some say love, it is a river, that drowns the tender reed","Some say love, it is a razor, that leaves your soul to bleed","Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need","I say love, it is a flower, and you its only seed","It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance","It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes a chance","It's the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give","And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live","When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long","And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong","Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows","Lies the seed that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
