Unfortunately, Saber has become extremely busy
and does not know when he will be able to come 
back to maintain and develop the Bard's Guild.
Since the guild has been ever so slowly 
disintegrating, I am shutting down this guild
(with Saber's permission, of course).
For those that this guild has been almost a way
of life look upon the ruins of the Bard Guild Hall
and have faith.

ps. To complete the closing once you find another 
    guild simply type 'toss_instrument'.
