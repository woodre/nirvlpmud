Bardic Guild Limitations

There Bardic Guild has the following limitations:

1)  Bards cannot Pk.  Not even in pk zones.  

2)  Bard spells don't kill.

3)  A bard takes hp damage if their pet dies.

4)  Bards must keep a positive alignment to use their powers...

5)  Bards must do trials for each level.  Alone.  If a bard can't figure
      out a trail, they don't get the bard levels.  Bards are not allowed
      to help each other with the trails.  This is a way to get kicked out
      of the bardic guild.
