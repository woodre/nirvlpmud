description "As you enter Akasha's coffin you notice the essence of a spring rain. Your body sinks comfortably into the thick down filling that liesbeneath the smooth white silk lining. As you look up you see a mural of dancing angels above you. It makes you wonder if Akasha is an angelamoung the living dead, or if you are indeed in a coffin or a small part of heaven.                                        "
