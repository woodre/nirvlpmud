description "is, well, Something.  After all, EVERYTHING is SOMETHING, right???	Something is an enigma.  Who or what he is, and where he has come fromare all a mystery.  Something cloaks himself in a long, flowing cloak of themost luxuriant black silk, pulled closely around him.  His head is hooded,but you catch brief glimpses of his features in the shadows.  You admire thedistinct, hauntingly familiar features of his face...until you turn away...For, the very second your eyes leave his visage, all memory of Something'sappearance is lost in a hazy fog...all but the recollection of skin as whiteas alabaster, and narrow red eyes that glow a mesmerizing, bloody red...**"
