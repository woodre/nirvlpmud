description "stands tall and proud as he roams the land. He has loose dark brown hair that curls slightly in the back. His light brown eyes sweep the room catching every detail. The smile on his lips appears to be permenant and lightens your mood when you see it. Llew's attire consists of deep black pants with silver trim running the length. His tunic is a dark river blue decorate with sky blue whorls and spirils. The most exquisite redwood mandolin is slung across his soldier. Dark runes on the bowl glow dimly.Firmly held in Llew's hand is an elm staff, symbolizing generosity. By his nature, you feel he would do anything you ask of him.A golden torc of a king surrounds his neck. The torc s carved in a celtic pattern."
