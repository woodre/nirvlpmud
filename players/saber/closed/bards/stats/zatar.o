description " is a simple man.  	He is dressed in a black kimono, white obi, and geka for his feet.  His long shiny black hair is bound simply into a pony tail.  His face is simple and carefree.  When his youthful face smiles, the sense of innocent joy and tranquillity beam forth.  His lithe body moves with grace and fluidity- as if every step is made on a cloud.  When he speaks, music pours forth- gentle and pleasing to the ear.  Mythos is a mortal embodiment of joy and fun.  But beware when he is angry; for dark storm clouds appear and his fury has no bounds.  The only changes that appear are those of his eyes and voice: black pools of calm turn into blue eyes of ice, gentle music turns into flat tones with thunder brewing beneith. Follow chivalry and politeness, and the anger will not unleash.  Let him be your friend and join him in finding fun in life."
