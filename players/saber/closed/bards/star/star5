You ask why Saber has been scarce of late?  The truth is that he is questing,
      (the Bardic One)  
searching for our missing founder, Harper.  It has been rumored that Harper
                               (Master Bard)                   (Master Bard)
has discovered a new type of Bardic lore, the Lore of Storm Magic.  Thus Saber
                                                              (the Bardic One)
has sough out Harper, that this new lore might be incorporated into the Bardic 
          (Master Bard)
Guild of Ryllian.  Be patient, o Bards, and soon you shall experience wonders 
                                           (most definitely shall!)
the likes of which you have never dreamed.
