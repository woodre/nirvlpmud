soul that my shade might remain.  During this period, my father taught me
necromancy, that I might one day revenge myself upon Slycerie and reclaim
my soul.  During this decade of years I was also to learn what it was to be
a Bard, and thus armed both with Necromancy and Bardic Lore, after ten years
I was ready to reclaim my soul.  With the aid of the Hero Christopher of the
Silver Sword, I invaded the temple of Arate and defeated Slycerie, reclaiming
      (a mighty tale, full of death, tragedy and rebirth - know you that 
       the Hero Christopher of the Silver Sword was slain in the process)
both my own soul and that of Melody, second of the seven immortal daughters 
of Cir.  Once more reunited with my soul, my necromantic father was able to
raise me from the dead.  And yet this was a time of sorrow, for while my
father wanted me to follow him in the paths of that dark magic, I chose
instead to travel with Harper, and continue my education in the paths of
                  (my new mentor)
Bardic Lore.  My father was enraged, casting me out of his house and
renouncing his name.  And yet judge my father not too harshly, for I know 
  (that Harper and I might no longer speak it)
