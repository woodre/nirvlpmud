that he yet regrets his hasty words, and though his pride forbids it, I 
sense still that one day we will yet be reconciled.  And so I travelled with
Harper, and eventually helped him found the Bardic Guild of Ryllian.  Many
                (with the help of a former Master Thief and Vampire, 
                     now known as Saber, the Bardic One)
years later we learned that my father had founded a guild/coven of dark 
magic practitioners, renouncing his ties to humanity in favor of power.  
It shames me that my father could so lose sight of what he once deemed so
important, that he could so forsake music and life and lore as to deal with
the powers of darkness.  And yet beneath it all, I know that there is still
hope for him, that he still retains some of what once made him great, for he
has forbidden any of his spawn to harm myself, Harper or our associates.  And
thus I charge you, look with both pity and mercy upon this coven of dark magic
  (fellow members of the Bardic Guild)
practitioners, and realize that though they may of fallen there yet may be a
path for them to find redemption.  Show them the Bardic ways, that they may
realize what they have lost in their degenerate quest for quick power.  And
rejoice in your choice, for you are truly on the side of the righteous.  May
the blessings of Crysea shine down upon you.
