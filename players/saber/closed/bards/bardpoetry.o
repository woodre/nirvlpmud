said I.    Pleaded me.I did not know,    I wanted to find,       what They supposedly had.          God had already given it.            I had to find it within myself.-Indigo Winter Knight**Say not my art is fraud; all liive by seemingThe beggar begs with it, and the gay courtierGains land and title, rank and rule, by seeming;The clergy scorn it not, and the bold soldierWill eke with it his service.All admit it,All practise it; and he who is contentWith showing what he is, shall have small creditIn church, or camp, or state.-So wags the world.end**Like a flower in the morning,you reavealed yourself to me.You caressed me with your petals,let me drink from your dew,let me revel in your aroma,in  the sun our passion grew.I brushed your bud with my fingers-tips,and you moaned the morn with glee,My lover my darling, grow tall and reach for me.Indigo Winter Night.***###**In the time of Life and DeathWhen Loves great Sarrow is Lonly LightTo bear the Pain of loves DenileAnd Seek the Justice of the trialFor us apart time exceedsThe vast emptiness of the seasAnd gods own choice of answer was..Be patient lovers untill what was is...**I wallow in the depths of depression  while all around me life goes onIt is my own little world I have created  for the thoughts and sounds are my ownAnd in this domain where nothing is sane  can reality come shining through?It is a question I've often pondered   but still the answer eludesAnd in the end of ends upon ends  the answer still eludesI often ask this simple question  in which little world are you?**When you look beyond the mirrored glassinto eyes of startling bluerealize they are yours alonethe rest of the world collapsingin decay and phosphoric smokebut pay no attentionYour eyes hold the keythe secret to salvationfor me and you and(who else matters?)our loveBut when you look only at yourown reflectionyou often seen green(with hazel amber rings)and wonderif you're looking at meyourselfor no one at allI have the answeryou need only look into my eyes(my dreams)and you will know.**I sit here, pen and paper before me,And I wonder, what should I say?What should I write?What should I say to the peopleWho took me in,Who made me one of themUnconditionally?I could write epic poems,I could create bittersweet ballads,I could do anything and everythingBut it wouldn't be enough......Not enough by any means.As I fight to hold backThe tears that threaten to fall,I can think of only a few thingsThat seem truly proper.I will miss you all, dearly.This may be my goodbye to you,My wonderful family.But whatever happens,Know and remember this......I love you all.Thank you to all of youWho believed in me.....It made me proud to be a Bard.And please remember this.....Spread our good around,Help all of those that need us.Carry on in the proud traditionOf the Bards!Chevren the Journeyman**Sometimes I think back, To all those happy times,Just the two of us,You and me.I worshipped you,You blessed me in so many ways.Your warm breath,Smelling of forests, mountain streams,And other soothing smells of the Earth,Blew against my face,While teasing fingersPlayed through the tangled locks of my hair.Your voice whispered to meThrough the trees,Foretelling of things to come.You comforted me when my heart was troubled,Filled the space in my soulWhen the pain became too much to bear.Now you are gone.Your laughter is gone,Chilling the air and cloaking the treesWith shrouds of red, orange, and purest gold.My heart weeps, for you are no longer with me.But we will be together again,When the first flowers of SpringBurst forth from the cold ground.Then your lips will touch mine,Your arms will embrace me,Your mouth will whisperYour blessings unto me.Originally written 10/4/94**Osibili, Si Ergo, Fortibuses in ero, Nobili, demis trux: Sewatis enim?

This Wizard sees and knows everything.->The Wizard is beyond opposites of light and dark, good and evil, pleasure and pain.->Everything the Wizard sees has its roots in the unseen world.->Nature reflects the moods of the Wizard.->The body and mind may sleep, but the Wizard is always awake.->The Wizard possesses the secret of immortality.->The return of the magical can only happen with the return of innocence.->The essence of the wizard is transformation.->The Wizard watches the world come and go, but his soul dwells in the realms of light.->The scenery changes, but the seer remains the same.->Your body is just the place your memories call home.->Who am I?  The only question worth asking and the only one never answered.->It is your destiny to play an infinity of roles, but these roles are not yourself.->The spirit is nonlocal, but it leaves behind a fingerprint, which we call the body.->A Wizard does not believe himself to be a local event, dreaming of a larger world.->A Wizard is a world dreaming of local events.->Wizards do not believe in death.  In the light of awareness, everything is alive.->There are no beginnings or endings.  To a Wizard these are only mental constructs.->To be most fully alive, you have to be dead to the past.->Molecules dissolve and pass away, but consciousness survives the death of the matter on which it rides.->A Wizard's consciousness is a field that exists everywhere.->The streams of knowledge contained in the field are eternal and flow forever.->Centuries of knowledge are compressed in revelatory moments.->We live as ripples of energy in the vast ocean of energy.->When the ego is set aside, you have access to teh totality of memory.->When the doors of perception are cleansede unseen world - The Wizard's world.->There is a wellspring of life within you where you can go for cleansing and transformation.->Purification consists of getting rid of the toxins in your life: toxic emotions, toxic thoughts, toxic relationships.->All living bodies, physical and subtle, are bundles of energy that can be percieved directly.More to follow...                                        - Lord Reflex**->The seat of power is the inner self.->The ego follows us like a dark shadow.  Its power is intoxicating and addicting, but ultimatly destructive.->The eternal clash of power ends in unity.->The wizard lives in a state of knowingness.  This knowingness orchestrates its own state of fulfillment.->The field of awareness organizes itself around our intentions.Knowledge and intention are forces.  What you intend changes the field in your favor.->Intentions compressed into words enfold magical power.->The wizard does not try to solve the mystery of life.  He is here to live it.->We all have a shadow self that is a part of our total reality.->The shadow is not here to hurt you but to point out where you are incomplete.->When you can live with all your opposite qualities, you will be living with your total self as the wizard.->The wizard is the teacher of alchemy.  Alchemy is the transformation.->Through alchemy you begin the quest for perfection.->You are the world.  When you transform yourself, the world you live in will also be transformed.->The goals of the quest--heroism, hope, grace, and love--are the inheritance of the timeless.->To summon a wizards help, you must be strong in truth, not stubborn in judgement.                                                        -Reflex the Teacher**->Wisdom is alive and therefore always unpredictable.->Order is another face of chaos,Chaos is another face of order.->The uncertainty you feel inside is the doorway to wisdom.->Insecurity will always be with the quester-he continues to stumble, but never falls.->Human order is made of rules.  The Wizards order has no rules - it flows with the nature of light.->The reality you experience is a mirror image of your expectations.->If you project the same images every day, your reality will be the same every day.->When attention is perfect, it creates order and clarity out of chaos and confusion.->Wizards do not grieve over loss, because the only thing that can be lost is the unreal.->Lose everything, and the real will still remain.->In the rubble of devastation and disaster are buried hidden treasures.->When you look in the ashes, look well.->To the extent you know love, you become love.->Love is more than an emotion.  It is a force of nature and therefore must contain truth.->When you say the word love, you may catch the feeling, but the essence cannot be spoken.->The purest love lies within where it is least expected - in unattachment.                                           -Reflex the Teacher**->Beyond waking, dreaming, and sleeping,there are infinite realms of consciousness.->A wizard exists simultaneously in all times.->A wizard sees infinite versions of every event.->The straight lines of time are actually threads of a web extending to infinity.->Seekers are never lost, because spirit isalways beckoning to them.->Seekers are offered clues all the time from the world ofspirit.  Ordinary people call these clues coincidences.->To a wizard there are no coincidences.  Every eventexists to expose another layer of the soul.->Spirit wants to meet you.  To accept its invitation,you must be undefended.->When you seek, begin in your heart.The cave of the heart is the home of truth.->Immortality can be lived in the midst of mortality.->Time and the timeless are not opposites.  Because itembraces everything, the timeless has no opposite.->At the level of the ego, we struggle to solve our problems.Spirit sees that struggle as the problem.->The wizard is aware of the bettle between ego and spirit,but he realizes that both are immortal and cannot die.->Every aspect of yourself is immortal,even the parts you judge most harshly.->Wizards never condemn desire.  It was by followingtheir desires that they became wizards.->Every desire is created by some past desire.The chain of desire never ends.  It is life itself.->Don't consider any desire useless or wrong - somedayeach one will be fullfilled.->Desires are seeds waiting for their season to sprout.From a single seed of desire, whole forests grow.->Cherish every wish in your heart, however trivial it mayseem.  One day these trivial wishes will lead you to God.->The most good you can do for thw world is to become a wizard.	                -Reflex the Teacher**This book is for poetry...so whatever you

cotton is high...Your daddy's rich...and your mom's good-looking...So hush, little baby, don't you cry....One of these mornigns...You're going to rise up, singing...then you'll spread your wings...and you'll take the sky....But 'til that morning...there's nothing can harm you...with daddy and mommy standing by....Porgy and Bess**From the mists of Avalon, she cameSeeking the knight with no name.Adrift upon the sea of dreamsEver to wander, seeking, it seems.From countless others, he entered this plane.Walker of worlds, the knight with no name.Upon many quests he ventured, turning wrong to right.But upon this plane, he found his name,He is the Bardic Knight.As fellow knights the two did meetand discovered between them, a love so sweetNow, she has the knight, and he her heartTogether forever, ne'er to part.**Here's something I thought was slightly appropriate...enjoy...:)Ode("Bards of Passion and of Mirth")Bards of Passion and of Mirth,Ye have left your souls on earth!Have ye souls in heaven too,Double-lived in regions new?Yes, and those of heaven communeWith the spheres of sun and moon;With the noise of fountains wond'rous;And the parle of voices thund'rous;With the whisper of heaven's treesAnd one another, in soft easeSeated on Elysian lawnsBrows'd by none but Dian's fawns;Underneath large blue-bells tented,Where the daises are rose-scented,And the rose herself has gotPerfume which on earth is not;Where the nightingale doth singNot a senseless, tranced thing,But divine melodious truth;Philiosphic numbers smooth;Tales and golden historiesOf heaven and her mysteries.Thus ye live on high, and thenOn earth ye live again;And the souls ye left behind youTeach us, here, the way to find you,Where your other souls are joying,Never slumber'd, never cloying.Here, your earth-born souls still speakTo mortals, of their little week;Of their sorrows and delights;Of their passions and their spites;Of their glory and their shame;What doth strengthen and what maim.Thus ye teach us, every day,Wisdom, though fled far away.Bards of Passion and of Mirth,Ye have left your souls on earth!Ye have souls in heaven too,Double-lived in regions new!John Keats, c. 1818**As the rain falls in August...and i see the worms crawl and drown in puddles.i wonder hbow this could be..how hat the rain would come so soon.when yesterday it was so noce and it was so warmhow the rain can come in August**Sing to meOf soft velvet morningsQuiet sighing breezesAnd warmed blankets.Talk to meIn a rich glowing toneOf the music in the treesWhen the birds awake at dawn.Sing to meWarm and safe in our bedHold me in your armsCall me lover.An original...by me...whatcha think?**"
