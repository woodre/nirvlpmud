The cantrip rainbow is a minor magic of the sphere of illusion.  When cast,
the bard may either direct the magical energy to the sky, or towards an object. 
If no target is selected, a rainbow will briefly appear in the sky.  If a 
target is selected, a harmless burst of colored light will be directed (at 
high velocity) towards it!
