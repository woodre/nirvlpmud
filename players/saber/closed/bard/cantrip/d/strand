The cantrip strand is a minor magic of the spheres of alteration/chaos.  This
cantrip is the initial step in art of shaping.  Once cast, the bard reaches 
through reality to pluck a single strand of chaos.  With a strand of chaos, an
imaginative Bard can create a replica of almost anything.  Common items shaped
are roses, saber dolls, engagement rings, and private notes.  More versed 
bards have reportedly shaped such wonders as gypsy wagons, kitty litter boxes, 
blow-up-dolls, and in one case, the famed Armageddon himself!
