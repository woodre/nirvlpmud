(Joining 2nd mini guild)
     I overheard some players talking that even though the scroll said you
had to be 2 days old to join a 2nd mini guild, you could actually join a
second one at 1 day.  I checked you agents and they were indeed correct.
So, I changed your age from 43200 to 86400 in each of the agents (approx.
line 78) so that it would be 2 days.  If this was not your intent and you
just forgot to change the scroll, then you'll need to change them back to
43200.  If you have questions, you can contact me...  -Eurale
