The Blades are all young swashbuckling street punks from the streets of
Ryllian.  They have been known to duel with their ever present dueling knives
at the slightest insult, but usually only until first blood has been shed.
Blades are good at identifying, repairing and being all around flamboyant with
their weapons.  They also have quite a sense of humor.
