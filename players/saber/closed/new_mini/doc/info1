The Mini Guilds of Ryllian  (version 2.0)
A Saber Product

The mini guilds of Ryllian are miniature guilds that you may join in ADDITION
to a regular guild.  To join a mini guild:

        You must be at least SIX hours old.
        You must find the recruiting agent.
        You must pay a registration fee of 5000 coins.

Mini guild recruiting agents can be found within the city of Ryllian (church,
south, 5 east, 3 north, 1 west, step rift).  Just ask the city guild for
directions once you are within the city of Ryllian.

Mini guilds are not intended to give a player unlimited power.  Rather, they
are social groups that just happen to give you a few nifty powers as an added
bonus.  Remember, style over substance!

You may join a second mini guild when you are two days old.
There are NO penalties for LEAVING a mini guild.

You can get your mini guilds restored in Ryllian by the city guard.
