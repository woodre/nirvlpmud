No small utensil that slips and slides ... then back in a drawer, where it safely hides away.  No sexual toy of any shape or kind.  But, a large electronone that fucks with your mind.  It makes you pant and mentally sweat, sit with your legs crossed and your crotch slightly wet.  It eats away with pleasurehaving no shame.  And, it comes out the winner in every game.**(by John Gillespie Magee, Jr.)Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earthAnd danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;Sunward I've climbed,and joined the tumbling mirthof sun-split clouds...and done a hundred thingsYou have not dreamed of...wheeled and soared and swungHigh in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,I've chased the shouting wind along, andFlung my eager craft through footless halls of air.Up, up the long, delirious, burning blueI've topped the windswept heights with easy graceWhere never lark, nor even eagle flew.And, while with silent, lifting mind I've trodThe high untrespassed sanctity of space,Put out my hand, and touched the face of GOD.**(by William Blake)"Love seekest not itself to please,Nor for itself hath any care,But for another gives its ease,And builds a Heaven in Hell's despair.So sung a little clod of clayTrodden with the cattle's feetBut a Pebble in the brookWarbled out these metres meet...Love seeketh only Self to please,To bind another to It's delight,Joys in another's loss of ease, And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite.**I am translucent, not transparent...My veil is never lifted...You must touch me to get through me..Some were, some are, some will be...I amI am flowI am painfully directed energyWhen I am pointed at you...I am pathNot in a flash, not in an instant...Slowly, and with great deliberation and total faithOpen your portals so that I may enter.**The space is lovely.

deadly, that we thought were dead,Stand waiting, every one.		written in 1954			by Walt Kelly**Morning sighed.An old man died.He simply died alone.And when he died, he left a table carved of nails and prideAnd with his hands he carved these words inside	'For my children.'Truth is sad,For not a child would claim the gift he had.The words he carved became his epitaph...	'For my children'**From the beginning of time,When Adam and Eve,Took the advice of a snake,And chose to conceive,Man has always been known,Or so it is felt,To listen and think,From below his belt.There is no telling,The chances he'll take,Or the hearts that he'll break,And nights that he'll lay awake,Taking the advice of a one eyed snake.A creature most wise in the arts of the pass,That lives and dies for it's next piece of ass.That quickly and slyly shows every little boyThat it would gladly become his favorite pull toy.The bane of mankind just asked for a hand,And the next thing you find, it is thinking for man.Knowing no reason and having no shame,It won't let you think straight till it's tired and lame.The one eyed snake will find every holeIn its unholy quest to capture your soul.From top to bottom, it searches for beds,And spends much time just to have its head.And if attention is devoted to it,It rejoices this mention with splutter and spit.After standing and turning, all red in the face,It coughs and splutters then falls in disgrace.Then quickly considers its next conquestThat it knows it will find when it gets some restFor the one eyed snake is as old as the earthAnd has been leading the way since man's very birth.     (written with permission)**This note was plucked from out of a book and kept tillnow...I want

myself clearlyIn episodes wild,Real life seems merelyThe life of the mildSaving the worldWithout even a sliver,The tales unfurledWould make some folks shiver.I'll fight all the evilsAnd creatures unnamed,Beside me is ElvisThe T-Rex I've tamed.I rescue fair maidensAnd princes besides.All hearts are ladenWith such joyful pride,I catch a roseThrown with a flair,Lift it to my noseWith a casual air.Such adventures awaitCould I let it pass?That, Dear ProfessorIs why I slept through class.**HeWhispers in your earTells you what he will do to you.His handsMove over your fleshShowing what he can do with you.HeTells you of his needWith a hoarse sound of passion.His handsArouse your bodyBring you to the edge of climax.HeWhispers in your earCalms you in the warm afterglow.**A poem by JB Orilley (sp?)The red rose speaks of passionAnd the white rose breathes of loveOn the red rose is a falconUpon the white rose is a doveSo I send you a

Im not realy sayingthat I should feel so badly, not ever having a real babyof my own, but he was still something special to me. I knowthat not many people like the new bunnies.. I dont know whybut we are more than just a phase.. we care for our character too.I married Moneybunny last week, he realy swept me off my feet.*blush* I got pregnant in our honeymoon suite, and spent thefirst four months here in this room, a lovely place to stay,while Moneybunny went out to collect things for the bunnyguild.Im sure you have all heard of the bunny pot.. unless your a you might no know how awful it is.. there are no exits, no summon out and since pain has banned bunnies from the ~*~channel not many people eccept bunnys who want to chat.I spent the rest of my pregnancy in the bunny pot.. itsnot a verry nice thing to do. moneybunny was there whenI gave birth to Thumper.. he was sooo cute! littlepink nose, long floppy ears and a beautiful grey fur.Snakespear and Ulath apeared and told me they would eat my babysnakespear told me there was no poin in keepingthumper.. if I couldnt get out of the pot then Icouldnt make it to daycare and he would die. I beggedUlath to save my baby Thumper.. he gave in and letme put thumper in the daycare.. Moneybunny and I,out of the pot now, took little Thumper to show tothe other bunnies, a new bunny, ghettobunny (Im guessinghe belonged to snakespear) was there in the room. Moneybunnyset Thumper down so that Pinkbunny, gothicbunny and sunnybunny could meet the first of our new bunnies.swinging around with an axe ghettobunny choped a deepgash into my baby, before i could blink moneybunnyhad taken thumper up and I was trying to set pkill on.babies tend to wriggle free if you dont stop them following.my little baby was in so much pain he wriggled free frommoneybunny, thats when ghettobunny finshed my baby off.Chopping with his axe he cut my Thumper down before helaughed and dissapeared. I just wanted to share with someone who knows how mucha baby means.. even a mudbaby.. like i said Im not oneto talk..

They carry childrenThey carry hardships, but they hold happiness, love and joyThey smile when they want to scream.  They sing when they wantto cry.  They cry when they are happy and laugh when theyare nervous.  Women wait by the phone for a "safe at homecall" from a friend after a snowy drive home.Women have special qualities about them.  They volunteerfor good causes.  They are pink ladies in hospitals, theybring food to shut-ins.  They are child care workers,executives, attorneys, stay-at-home moms, biker babes, andyour neighbors.  They wear suits, jeans, and they wear uniforms.They fight for what they believe in.  They stand up for injustice.  They are in the front row at PTA meetings.They vote for the person that will do the best job forfamily issues.  They walk and talk the extra mile to gettheir children in the right schools and for getting theirfamily the right health care.  They write to the editor, theircongressmen and to the "powers that be" for things thatmake for a better life.  They don't take "no" for ananswer when they believe there is a better solution.They stick a love note in the lover's lunch box.  Theydo without new shoes so their children can have them.They go to the doctor with a frightened friend.  Theylove unconditionally.  Women are honest, loyal, and forgiving.  They are smartknowing that knowledge is power.  But they still know how to usetheir softer side to make a point.Women want to be the best for their family, their friends,and themselves.  They cry when their children excel andcheer when their friends get awards.  They are happy whenthey hear about a birth or a new marriage.  Their heartsbreak when a friend dies.  They have sorrow at the lossof a family member, yet are strong when they think thereis no strength left.  A woman's touch can cure any ailment.They know that a hug and a kiss can heal a broken heart.A woman can make a romantic evening unforgettable.Women come in all sizes, in all colors, and shapes.They live in homes, apartments, and cabins.  They drive,fly, walk, run, or email you to show you how much theycare about you.  The heart of a woman is what makes theworld spin!  Women do more than just give birth, they bring joyand hope.  They give compassion and ideals.  They givemoral support to their family and friends.  And all theywant back is a hug, a smile, and for you to do the sameto people you come in contact with.to people you come in contact with.MENMen are good at lifting heavy stuff and killing bugs.Sorry this is soo long, but I hope you enjoyed readingit.  *Hugs her sisters*-=Ciara=-**(Dedicated to all those who, in their heart, will always find a home on Nirvana)Shrouded in mistIn a realm far awayIs a place where my heartLives still, to this dayLate into the eveningAlong the darkened streetI find myself walkingAnd pray that we'll meetIn each empty buildingWindows dark and coldEcho with laughterAnd with voices of oldThe voices, they call out to meTrading joy for painThose I love have since moved onOnly ghosts now remainAs I pass by each placeThat we once called our ownMy sighs echo softlyI am evermore aloneI would give much to returnTo days long in the pastBefore our tearful farewellsThe love I thought would lastBut time, it ever marches onLife's street is but one wayTry as I might, I can't recaptureEven one past perfect dayExcept...in my mindNow shrouded in mistWhere my love and my comradesThey all still existNow, I know in my heartWhere'er I roamWhen I close my eyes.....I have finally come home.**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
