The Esquire is a movie theatre currently based for newbie to mid newbieish levels. 
Later on there will be new movies placed in the theatre based for mid to higher 
level players.  To reach each movie the player will have to 'touch screen' and s/he
will be transported to in side the movie so they can fight the characters of whatever 
movie they are in.

Below is a diagram of the current lay out of the Esquire.  Once more movies are 
featured the map will be updated.
