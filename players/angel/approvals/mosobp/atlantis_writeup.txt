                    Atlantis

	Atlantis is a massive city of the Ancients filled with untapped technology,
believed to have served as the central nexus for all Ancient activity in the
Pegasus Galaxy.  Now the Tau'ri run the operation of atlantis.  Atlantis is
only partly explored which players will be able to explore as well.  Atlantis
is about as large as New York city.  This will allow for future expansion of
this area.  However I plan on creating several other new areas to travel to 
through the stargate. 
	I have also used the sergeant's, corporals, and P90 from stargate because
they are the ones who control Atlantis.  No need to make a new military when 
the one you got works great.
