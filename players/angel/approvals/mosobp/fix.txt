      Mosobp Fix file 1


OK, organization and neatness is a must.
your code needs to be neat and clean.

This includes spacing from the left in 2's
and keeping your info in the same place in
each file. I also took out the * on the right 
side of the header so you dont have to worry about
keeping it in a straight line. I set up this file as
an example for you to fix the rest.  I have
not addressed the level hp wc ac issues. do you use 
/doc/build/RULES/monster.guide 
to keep levels in line with mud standards?
also do you have an external editor? like crimson editor(their free)
It makes coding easier, kinda like using word.

On your 2 obj's the long is Blah, that wont work.
give them a description.

I lined out a room file as well.  I know that many
different ways of coding will work but it needs to 
be clean, organized and use proper spacing. also 
I talk to Fred about the area cause were are
trying to have areas that are not 1 room replicated 
many times.  If i understood you correct this is a
DBZ theme. Well let talk about it when you are on.

This file does NOT address grammar and spelling, just format
fix the format then I will hit the files again
