       it should be no more than 1/2 the base for level hp wc ac.
       Since your base is 500 random should be no more than 250

          need to be in line with the rest
  --      also you need to keep you spacing the same in each file.
          so either single or double space the following:

          #include "/obj/ansi.h"

  --      the long desc's says they can only be used by
          a person with good intentions. either take that 
          part out or have it destruct when a player with
          negative alignment picks it up. This is not that 
          hard so dont let the code worry you.
          
          
  
          
          
    Well, it look like you have good spelling and grammar.
    Now you get to fix the code issues....................
