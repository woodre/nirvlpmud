Hello Chip,

A couple things to start with that you need to do.

1)   Each time you create an area you should create a write up on the area.  You can view     
      /players/angel/area/stargate/stargate_writeup.txt     or  
      /players/vital/training/sample.writeup.txt
      for an example how to make your own.  Then FTP it in your files for admin to view.     
      This should tell us what the area is about and detail everything that is in your area.      
     

2)	Every file you create no matter how simple should have a header.  Some of your files 
    have one and some do not. ADD one to every file.  Also the one I see in your file is short.
    I would suggest you use the following:

Example:

      /*                                                                    
       *    File:             /players/angel/area/atlantis/room/123.c            
       *    Function:         room                                          
       *    Author(s):        Angel@Nirvana                                 
       *    Copyright:        Copyright (c) 2007 Angel

       *    Notes:                                                          
       *                                                                    
       *                                                                    
       *    Change History:                                                 
       */

Blank:


      /*                                                                    
       *    File:                 
       *    Function: 
       *    Author(s):        
       *    Copyright:       
       *                            
       *    Source:            
       *    Notes:                                                          
       *                                                                    
       *                                                                    
       *    Change History:                                                 
       */
       
     Header should be detailed and give as much information as possible.

     
     3)   All room description lines should NOT be longer than 70 characters
          a quick way to see if they are too long is type "ruler" when you are
          in the room.  This will display how long each line is. Also depending
          on the editor you use, many will display this information.
          
    4)    I am attaching Nirvana's basic guide to NPC/MOB levels. I am not sure
          if you have read this building file.  You do not have to be exact and 
          can use random a bit but you need a good reason you be way off. I'll
          get more into your NPC/MOB's later when I break down each file.

1. Monsters above level 19 should not be common.  As such,
you should have a larger proportion of monsters 19 and
below, than above.

2. A special ability is a unique power that the monster has
that requires special coding.  These abilities can include
multiple attacks, area attack spells, mini-monster summoning,
and more.  Wizards should take this opportunity to be creative.



     5)  Ok, the next fix file I write up will have the room
         corrections in it.  If you have not read all of the 
         files in /doc it will help you in your coding. Also
         Vital was the Wiz who trained me and he has some good
         files to read for learning rules and all the basic in
         /players/vital/training       /players/vital/examples
         /players/vital/doc        I recommend you read all of
         the files in the given paths.  One last bit of good
         reading is http://wunderland.mud.de/mud/doc/efun/index.html
         and http://www.merentha.com/descartes/  These last two
         files I re-read to continue my learning of code and
         each time I read them along with coding more I understand
         more.
