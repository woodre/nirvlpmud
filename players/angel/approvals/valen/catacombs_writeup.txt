Theme: The theme idea is basically a dungeon area that once used by the magi
that lived on the isle. I want the theme dark and curious.

Concept: It will lead to other areas in the future.  Thats why I'm sticking in the
archways into the description. Very simple NPC's called vermin. There will about 4-6
of them.  But two rather sizable NPC's that are hidden. Which will be a Imp and a skeleton.
The imp will have two items.  The imp will carry heals and a belt.  Plus the imp will have
a chance to drain SPS as the special attack.  The Skeleton will be a straightforward melee
attacker and carrying coins and a bronze key.  But to get to the skeleton the player must
search the wall and push the hidden button.  The key will unlock the gate to the imp. And
the players are done.  Pretty simple!
   
Layout: 3x3 catacombs. The entrance/exit is in the middle.
The hidden button will be  in the second row , third column.
The gate with bronze key hole will be in the third row,  second column.  

Items in rooms: Some rooms will contain the following: floor, ceiling, wall,
pillar, torch, fountain, archway, runes, broken pillar, pebbles, and dust.
Everything will be put in the catacombs file. The Castle entrance will be
changed to Catacombs. I'm not sure where to begin just yet.  But I'm completely
open to suggestions.
