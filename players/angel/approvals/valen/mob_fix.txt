                           MOB Files
                           
     All MOBS
                                                 
---  I am starting with the mobs set_long.  As I have said many times
     there is more than one way to code the same thing and have it work.
     However, you need to stick to 1 way. It needs to be keep the same
     for every file.  So, It does not matter whether it is \n\ or \n"+
     Fix them all to one or the other, but I will not allow it to be back
     and fourth.
     
     This, also includes spells they need to be the same code type.
     
    Imp 
    
--- when creating a mob you need to follow the mud standards.  I gave you 
    a file with the level ac wc hp and coin cost.  Now on the coin cost, this
    is the total allowable amount which includes any item/s a mob drops.
    This means that the imp drops a belt. You have the value of the belt
    500 random 500.  So I would take in to count the variance and access 
    it at 750 coins.  The mob is level 18 so this should be 3500 coins.
    3500 - 750 = 2750. So, the amount of coins dropped could be up to 2750.
    I have talked with Fred and Vert about varying from the set levels when
    using random. President is 4.  What this means is if a level 18 mob is 
    wc 26 ac 15  then when using random it can be 26 random 4  15 random 4.
    Now let me say this, I know you can find examples where wizes don't follow
    the rules, one it is not right and two it does not make it ok for us to
    do it wrong.  That said set ur levels to follow the mud standards.  Use
    random, this will get u a little bigger mob and make it where it is not predictable.   
    ur random is not bad just the base number.  The issue with random is being too
    random.  If I am a level 16 player and go in ur area with a random of 4 I can prob
    take the mobs at the different levels with little issue, but add a random of
    20 then one I can kill and the next one I am killed in the first round.  Not fair to
    the players.  Funny for us, not for them and they are why we are here.
    
    In the long change the 4th sentence to ,which  or change Which to It
    
    In the long_desc you need to add \n"); at the end.  You have "); which is wrong.
    Then readjust the lines to be about the same length....

--- wc 26 random 4
--- ac 15 random 4
--- hp 400 random 100
--- coins 2500 random 1000  plus u have the belt 750 a potential of 4250... 
    still above set amount, but potential on the bottom side is 3002 coins


    Skeleton


--- wc 26 random 4
--- ac 15 random 4
--- hp 400 random 100
--- coins 3500 random 1000 


    Vermin
    
---wc 15 random 4
---ac 9  random 5
---hp 165  
---coins 500 random 250

Vermin it overwhelming in its long_desc Change the 3rd and last Vermin to Its 
Then readjust the lines to be about the same length....


Good job overall with spelling and grammar.....
