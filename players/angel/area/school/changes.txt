general note with mobs
  I've seen a couple load_chat(query_name()+" says, \"Something something.\n");
  That will show up as, Name says, "Something something.
  If you want the other " at the end so it reads:
   Name says, "Something something."
  You need to do a load_chat(query_name()+" says, \"Something something.\"\n");

  Another general note is I see you use
  object gold;
  gold = clone_object("/obj/money"); 
  gold->set_money();

  For convenience on a mob you can just use add_money() instead.
