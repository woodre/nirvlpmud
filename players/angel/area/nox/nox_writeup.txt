                            Nox Homeworld

	Nox Homeworld is another area Stargate SG1 has explored. Though they appear to be
primitive forest-dwellers, the pacifist, nature-loving Nox are one of the galaxy's
oldest and most advanced races. Capable of living hundreds of Earth years, the Nox
believe they are symbiotically linked with nature, and treasure the world in which they
live.  Physically, Nox are very similar to humans, though their hair is elaborately 
different. Both hair and clothing reflect their forest surroundings. Many live in hut's
with in the forests, basking in shade. Others reside in a massive, floating city near the 
Stargate. They love to eat, and appear to be simple vegetarians.  The nox are one of the
original four races in the greatest alliance's protecting the universe.
	At this time I coded a small forest area with the main four nox SG1 team has meet. They
are a Grand father, daughter, her husband, and their son.  The nox become invisible at 
will so I made them invis all the time since they never want to get involved with others
and are pacifist, but much stronger and technological than the humans.  I also coded a
Fenri, a dragon like with hummingbird speed bird, and placed several in the area.  I plan 
to come back to this area and expand down the road but want to add more areas to explore 
through the Stargate first.
