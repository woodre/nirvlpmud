Town of Gas City

	This area will put together all the areas I have already created for
Gas City.  The school, colony, walmart, and the pub will all fit into the
town.  I have also added many new businesses to the town.  Some sell objects
while others are out of stock.  Throughout  the whole town there are citizens
and employees that can be killed.  Most of the mobs have a credit card that
can be redeemed for cash when players take them to Bob.
