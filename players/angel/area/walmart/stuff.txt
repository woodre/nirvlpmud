doughnut.c -- should be physical dmg.  No reason for it to be poison.

padano.c -- should be physical dmg.  No reason for it to be mental.

pork.c -- should be physical dmg.  No reason for it to be poison.

manakin.c -- need to add set_dead_ob(this_object()); to the reset()
             if you want your monster_died() to work.

When cloning multiples of the same thing to an object like your gift
cards it's easier to use a looping function like a while or for loop
instead of using multiple armor = clone_object() move_objects.  See
anakin.c as an example.  You don't have to change them all unless you
want to just so you know for future reference.

Other than that you can put it in the game.

I know this was kinda your 'coin' area but in the future I'd like to
see more out of your stuff as far as here they all carry gift cards
but like say anakin's descrip says he has all this gear but you don't 
actually get any idea.
