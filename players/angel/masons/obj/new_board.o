new_text "Well after joining this mini guild, its disheartening to see that so many abilities have been disabled for one reason or another. So I suggest the following ideas.First is dream, we have enough damage spells so why not just turn it into an emote instead, kinda like a fdraw for fallen, type dream (number) where number is the specific dream you send to a player.Second is recon, instead of showing if they are in another guild, something we can all check with s_who or finger command, it can be used for something else, like a more advanced version of look north, lets say if you look north, it says that there is a demon in there, so type recon north demon, and it will show you how tough the mob is, hp, etc, and some kind of rating on how aggressive it is.next on the list is spy, dont know if it means location as in the short description or long description, but either way there are ways to see it in the game, mainly boltar's area and who2. So there really isnt any legal issues there. Though if anything it should work like laptop does, if your invis and im lower leveled than you then it wont work, but if I am higher then I get to see your location. Ohhh teleport...ya know I can see why we cant teleport to a member, but why not teleport to the lodge atleast. All mini guilds can teleport, most guilds can teleport, so again dont see the reason this was considered illegal including the fact that cyberninjas can also teleport to each other. If such things are illegal then why are these things still possible?xsell...well I know vamps have this ability and if someone is really desperate they can use a bottomless bag to sell with, so again, portable selling...if it was deemed illegal why do these abilities already exist...just up the cost of selling the items, or make it so that you can only sell so many items this way a day.Lastly if this was a guild before, how about including a lil guild history that is if anyone remembers any from back in the day. Well those are my suggestions, ill suggest more when I figure out the theme of the mini guild"
