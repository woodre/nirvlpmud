You may summon one of two things:  guardian or djinni

Guardian:
---------
   Summon the guardian to keep other players from attacking monsters
   you're working on.  It will prevent any player beside yourself from
   using any spells or kill commands in the same room with the guardian.
   And it will tell you who is trying to attack your monster.
   You can release the guardian by typing 'dismiss guardian'.
   You can have your guardian follow you by typing 'follow'
   This costs:  50 sp + 500 coins

Djinni:
-------
   Use the Djinni to transfer items from one player to another.
   Typing 'transfer <object> to <player>' will move the <object> to the
   <player> specified.  You must be carrying the object you wish to
   transfer.
   This costs:  50 sp + the value of the <object>/ 50 coins

The Guardian Demon will leave after 20 minutes.
To summon:  summon <guardian or djinni>
