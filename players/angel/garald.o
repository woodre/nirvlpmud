coffin_description "A richly detailed illusion overlays the reality of Garald's coffin.  Thewindowless walls are of a dark, shiny mahogany, decorated with a number ofpaintings, except for the west wall, which is entirely covered in bookshelves,filled with well-read books.  Placed before the bookcase, atop a rich,midnight blue carpet, a large-comfortable couch faces a pair of armchairsacross an ornate coffee table.  On the opposite end of the coffin, a large bedwith a sleek, modern metal frame is piled high with pillows and comforters.A fully stocked bar runs along the north wall, and a large wardrobe faces itfrom the south.  There are even illusory lamps, providing a pool of light overthe reading area, and shadowy corners."
