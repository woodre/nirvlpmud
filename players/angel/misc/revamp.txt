Castle Revamp Angel

	I plan to revamp my castle.  The overall theme is Stargate SG1.
All my current and new area will be linked to a stargate where players
can visit different planets and different worlds.  Many will end up
having humans but some will have alians in their world, just like in the 
TV show.  Players will enter into the stargate room, then they will need 
to open the stargate where they want to go.  All planets will have a
military listing such as SR273 ot LE376. The player will be able to look
at the computer and get a short desc. of the planet and then open the 
gate to which they want to goto. Currently I am coding The Land of 
Lowthar and completing the town of Gas City, which also has a Quest in
it. Once finished Gas City will all be connected.  Then I will have
The Land of Lowthar and I will add one more area with aliens that wiil 
be a small area(15-20 rooms) before I make the changes. I plan to 
continue to add small areas(15-20 rooms) till I get 10 to 15 area's.
