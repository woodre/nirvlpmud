Kardiapyr smiles as you enter, her curly red locks of hair sway about her six foot muscual physique.

Kardiapyr deeply tanned skin shnes with persperation as she dances and twirls about the room. or around the room..whatever

and when she gets attacked

Kardiapyr glares at you with anger adn hatred as a searing flame burts from the floor incinerating her to ashes.


Quaisorir, standing no taller than fight feet, absently stares out the rooms only window.
Moonbeams from the night sky radiate off her petite ivory body as her shoulderleangth silver hair sparkles brightly.

Quaisorir, slowly turns toward you as she licks her ruby red lips.

and when she gets attacked
 Quaisorir, glares at you icily as an artcic mist surrounds her. she freezes solid and shatters before your eyes.


Sartori calmly leans against the far back wall of the chamber.
He is dressed in black leather which in no way conceals the muscualr body beneath.

Sartori arrogantly sturts toward you, his long ebon hair and floor leangth cloak silently billowing in the night wind behing him.

and when he getts attacked

Sartori makes a quick gesture with his hand and wraps his cloak around him. He begins to melt into the floor.
