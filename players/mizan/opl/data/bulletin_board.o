messages "Welcome to my Proving Grounds![OverPowerLord, Sun Mar 27 19:27:47 2011]:**>>> WELCOME TO THE PROVING GROUNDS OF THE OVERPOWERLORD!We hope you have a fun time here, in a gigantic maze offering unparalleledlevels of VIOLENCE, MAYHEM, and general purpose FUN for ALL ADVENTURERS!The structure of the maze should be intuitive for you to follow. You descendinto the northeast corner where the maze starts, and the objective is tomake your way to the solution which will be in one of the other threecorners. If you journey to one of the 'wrong' corners, don't worry as yourtime won't be wasted... you will still encounter a puzzle to solve or somegiant monster to kill. It will be rewarding- we promise.To assist in your journey within the maze, an overhead map will be displayed.It is dynamic in nature, and reflects what you or others have discovered andtraveled through thus far.**"
