>> OVERVIEW OF THE PROVING GROUNDS OF THE OVERPOWERLORD
>> Mizan (sausage@beanos.com), May 2011

* SUMMARY
The concept of this area is that of a giant maze set far underground and
in the spirit of a giant theme park for experienced adventurers. The target
audience are high level players in large parties. The realm is meant to be
too difficult for single players to traverse on their own.

Players enter from the northeast corner and must make their way to the
remaining three corners- one of which contains a final showdown with the
maze boss OverPowerLord. The other two corners contain one very hard
monster each. A unique feature in this area is that people who successfully
solve the map are instructed to contact Mizan, providing a claim code, and
a valid shipping address. Physical goodies will be mailed to the winner.
Supplies of prizes are limited, on a first-come, first-serve basis.

The maze features a top-down Roguelike dynamic view, showing other player
locations, terrain, piles of gold, or other landmarks. The memory footprint
is roughly the same load as /room/room.c per cell, and is daemon controlled.

The size of the maze is fairly large. There are a roughly 4500 navigable
room cells bounded by "mountains", each of which has the chance to spawn
a variety of creatures or hazards (or both).

The layout of the maze itself is static, but the position of contents
within can be randomly shuffled at a interval which is to be determined.
The process of shuffling the maze is performed via a Perl script.

There are a variety of hazards within the maze itself, ranging from
aggressive monsters, damage-dealing squares, and explosives which can be
fatal to players. 

In general the realm offers a high payout of EXP, but at an expense of
lower gold coins given the amount of work to kill monsters.

There are healing stations in the form of vending machines which sell a
variety of multi-use heals scattered across the maze. They all have limited
inventory, and also exclusively operate by way of the bank balance. Some of
the healing items they sell expire within a certain time period if they
are not used quickly enough.

A variety of expensive luxury items exist in the realm to try and act as
a giant coin sucking machine. One example is a bulletin board which costs
500k coins to make a posting.



>> OBJECT OF THE MAZE AND OUTCOME UPON SOLVING
The objective is to find OverPowerLord and defeat him in combat.
If this objective is achieved, players will be told to email Mizan with
a redemption code which will cause Mizan to reply asking for valid
shipping address(es). Players will then be mailed winning prizes for
their achievement.

>> HAZARDS
There are no dark rooms in the maze area, but some single-room complexes can 
be entered by using the right key on the lock. These complexes have a good
chance of having an aggressive monster, or a lit explosive (more on this later).

Everything is coded to use damage types, with a few exceptions- being the two
explosives which are designed to deal out certain death to players.

Corridor cells have a chance of presenting hazards in the following forms:

  * EXPLOSIVES - environs/ied.c
  This is an explosive, which deals 3000 hitpoints in damage to anyone nearby.
  It is almost certainly fatal to all players, and can significantly weaken a
  higher level monster which comes close enough. There is a 50% chance that on
  load an IED will be 'lit' and if the player(s) are not paying attention on
  arrival they will be all be caught in the blast. In a fully loaded state
  there are roughly 80-90 of these IEDs scattered across the entire maze.

  * MEAT EXPLOSIVES - environs/whale.c
  This is a variation of above, which litters the MUD with dead whale meat on
  explosion. Similarly, these also have a 50% chance of being 'lit' on arrival
  with a random timer of 3-8 seconds before it detonates. Players are warned
  on entry of the maze by the gatekeeper that explosives are present and
  can be instantly lethal.

  * LAVA - environs/lava.c
  This hurts a player (50 + random(40)) in "fire" every few seconds.
  It is generally very obvious that a player is in a lava room, plus it
  also appears on the map.

  * RADIOACTIVITY - environs/uranium-puddle.c
  This infects a player with radiation sickness if a player lingers too
  long near this pool. The sickness eventually goes away over time, and
  hits players with (10 + random(10)) "other|radiation" hitpoints every
  few seconds.

  * AGGRESSIVE, UNKILLABLE FIXED POSITION MOB - environs/autocannon.c
  This is a WC 80 monster which aggressively attacks anything which enters
  its room. It cannot be killed. Players are hinted to its nature as an
  unstoppable annoyance. It can be temporarily disabled (10 minutes) by
  purchasing a 100,000 coin item (items/autocannon-remote.c).

  * AGGRESSIVE, UNKILLABLE FIXED POSITION POOPGUN - environs/poop-volcano.c
  Similar to above, except this is a WC 160 monster, and it fires poop
  instead of bullets. It too can be disabled temporarily with a key fob
  remote (items/volcanogun-remote.c) available for 150,000 coins.

>> MONSTERS IN GENERAL
Monsters inherit from the file opl/core/monster.c which has some added
hazards from the normal monster.c

  * MORE WIMPYING - Monsters who do not block exits will wimpy when
  they are in trouble.

  * HARD HITTING - If a player with more than 400HP is tanking, the monster
  has a 1/25 chance of striking the player hard enough to take them down
  to roughly 80 hitpoints. This is good to keep things hazardous but within
  reasonable fairness to tanks who don't have nearly as much HP.



>> 'EASY' MONSTERS

The following are 'easier' monsters which can be found typically within
single-width passages. There is a maximum of 6 monsters present in one cell,
and whenever there is an intersection (more than 2 exits) there is a 50%
chance that a monster will appear that 'blocks' the intersection preventing
movement until that monster is killed.

MOST of these monsters pull their stats from a daemon (statsDM.c) which
then assigns them their values such as HP, WC, AC, level, and gold coins.
1 in 10 monsters will have their WC elevated by 30%. There will be no other
indication that this monster is unique. This serves to break up the routine
and keep players sharp.

Additionally, if these monsters are not dispatched within 120 rounds of
combat, they will gate in additional help (in the form of a cobold or a
knobgoblin).

>> 'MEDIUM' MONSTERS in the Fungal Forests

These are the green cells in the maze area. Monsters are not as heavily
populated in these areas as they are in the 'grey' maze block cells.

Some monsters are sneaky and utilize tactics such as always facing to
attack the weakest player of a party, or also side-striking pets and
kids. Other monsters have a 15% chance for a random(400) or similar
attack spell.

Similar to the "easy" monsters from above, there is a 1 in 10 chance that
a monster will clone with a 50% boost in WC.

>> 'MEDIUM' MONSTERS

These monsters can be found normally within passageways, or any area
that I need a slightly stronger 'choke point'. It is not inherently
obvious that an area contains medium strength monsters, because I have
not indicated a color change within a passageway.

The 1-in-10, 50% boost in WC rule is also in effect for these monsters.

>> HARD MONSTERS

These monsters can also be scattered within normal maze passageways.
They tend to exist either as individual isolated blocks to keep players
on their toes, or in a large clump with the intent to offer significant
resistance to a group of players in combat.

These monsters do not come with a WC boost, but 1 in 6 will have a 50%
boost in their HP.

>> SEA MONSTERS (All invisible, all in water areas)

These monsters are all invisible and operate in a fashion fairly similar to
those in the Wasteland graveyards.

>> RARE MONSTERS (Random locations, 'reward' placement at ends of passages.)

These monsters tend to be a bit cushier with their rewards because they are only
encountered at the dead end of a passageway. Of course there are odds that other
items could be at the end of passageways as well, such as explosives, lava, or
radiation pools.

>> BOSS MONSTERS

These monsters exist only in three places- the extreme corners of the maze.
Defeating any one of them will result in a message being displayed to the
player, along with a long entry indicating that they should get in contact
with Mizan as they have just won a 'real life' reward, consisting of some
real-life goods which will be shipped by Mizan.

These items are of a limited supply, sent out on a first-come, first-win
basis. Upon defeat of the OverPowerLord, a portal is cloned which will allow
players to leave the maze without having to fight their way home.
The player(s) are instructed to mail Mizan to claim their prize- which on
receipt of their email I will ask them for a valid shipping address to send
a toy package, consisting of some OverPowerLord themed trading cards and buttons.

The other bosses do not generate such portals, and do not offer physical prizes.
The Gurkha offers a WC 21 blade in addition to its large payout of coins.
The blade is located in beasties/hard/gurkha/kukhri.c and has a maximum
return of 10, 20 percent of the time.

>> UNKILLABLE MONSTERS

These monsters are not meant to be killed, and are part of the room complex
on top of the actual maze area. They serve mainly ornamental purposes.

>> HEALS

Most of these heals are sold by randomly placed vending machines in the maze.
There is a limited supply of each heal for each vending machine.
Some heals have drawbacks in that they are completely ineffective, or
that they can actually hurt a player.

>> VEHICLES

Vehicles have taken a greatly diminished role from what I originally intended.
They are still in the map, and serve mostly as a gimmick item which would let
a player (or group of players) travel freely around on the map for a limited
number of cells, primarily because fuel runs out. Fuel is not sold, and the
only amount of fuel available is found littered in the maze.

Vehicles have their "up" exit disabled, so anyone who drives "down" into a pit
will become strandard. Additionally, they will not be able to leave the maze
with a vehicle.

Vehicles are by default locked, and to gain access to it players must find
a corresponding key, which may or may not be carried by a particular monster.

>> LOGGING
Monster kills are logged in the file opl/monster_kills.csv
It is in the form of a standard CSV file, with fields encapsulated in quotes
and separated with commas. The fields being logged are:
- Time/Date of kill
- Filename of monster killed (including instance number)
- Total rounds of combat
- Player name (creature name) credited with kill
- Filename of room

It is from this file that if anyone were to solve this maze I would use as a
basis to verify actual completion.

Additionally, all actions performed by players in the same room as the
OverPowerLord while in combat are logged to logs/opl_combat.csv and 
logs/opl_snoop.log
