>> Using the 88mm Cannon

You should understand that the 88mm KwK cannon onboard is a precision made
weapon that can KILL both the operator and target if you are not careful.
Killing the target is immensely preferred.

To operate the cannon, you must have the proper certified ammunition.
Only 88mm shells are acceptable for use with this gun.

'open breech' to open the breech, exposing the receiver of the weapon.

'arm shell' with the appropriate shell. Note that each type of shell has
different purposes and effect.

'close breech' to properly chamber the round.

Now you must 'aim <target>'. Valid targets are living creatures in the
presence of the vehicle, and players across the MUD.

You are now ready to fire, and the command 'pull trigger' will do the deed.

Be aware that firing too many rounds quickly will overheat the barrel.
Over time, the barrel will cool. It is not a good idea to fire when overheated
or else serious personal injury will occur to the crew.
