>> Intercom system

The passenger and driver seats have separate intercom systems that allow
people on the outside to hear exactly what the driver or passenger says.

Note that other passengers aboard the vehicle will also hear the exact same
communications. In order to use this intercom please reference these commands.
For those in the cargo area, refer to the 'icom' command. Cargo area intercom
is only used for flash traffic, and is ONE-WAY in nature. You will not be able
to hear communications from the outside.

intercom on      - Turns the intercom on. You must be at the driver or
                   passenger seat to use this function. Those in the cargo area
                   have a separate intercom facility. Again, the driver and
                   passenger seats have their own separate intercom systems.
                   Once activated, anything the operator 'says' will be heard
                   clearly by those inside AND outside the vehicle. The 'icom'
                   command will be redundant when the intercom is in this mode.

intercom off     - Turns the intercom off. Only passengers inside the vehicle
                   will hear verbal communications.

icom <msg>       - Intercoms a brief one line message without toggling the 
                   system on or off. Useful for flash traffic.
