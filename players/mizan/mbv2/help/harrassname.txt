>> ORDER: HARRASS PLAYERS BY NAME

Usage:
order <indexnum> harrassname <plyrname> <duration>

Example:
'order 3 harrassname mizan 10'

Description:
Similar to the basic harrass command, but applies to players by specific
name. Be aware that if a player logs out, and logs back in again the 
monster will still harrass them. This is the strength of this command.
