>> ORDER: HITFADE ATTACK OBJECT

Usage:
order <indexnum> hitfade <creature> <duration>

Example:
'order 3 hitfade mizan 10'

Description:
A Hit-and-Fade attack is an order of magnitude more annoying than the
standard 'follow and kill' method employed by the 'huntobj' command. This
fighting technique lets the monster pound on the player for a few rounds,
and then randomly teleport out where the monster can heal or just chill. 

This cycle is then repeated causing considerable battle stress on less
brave players. This is the preferred attack style of monsters that have
higher cruelty attributes.
