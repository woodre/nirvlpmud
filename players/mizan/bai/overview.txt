OVERVIEW FOR MIZAN'S CURRENTLY UNNAMED AREA

* SUMMARY
The concept of this area is that of a large, two-dimensional grid which
serves as a traditional killing ground for mid to high level players. It also
has the dual role of allowing for players to alter the terrain, in a form
similar to the 3D game Minecraft. Players would be able to purchase a slot
in which they could establish their "home base". They would be obligated to
defend it from attack by the monsters in the maze (or from other players)
by purchasing additional items to fortify and protect their home base. 

* ARRANGEMENT
When a player purchases a home base, they are given a spot on the master grid
which they can make modifications to. The total area which they are allowed
to is 15 by 15 squares. Players cannot expand beyond that area, and they
cannot expand into adjacent lots which may or may not belong to other players.
There is also a buffer space of 6 squares between each grid. A simplified
map of the layout looks like below:

 *------------------------*
 |XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX| Areas which have been 'X'ed out are zones where
 |XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX| player lots are assigned. 
 |XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|
 |XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX| The passageways between the zones represent the
 |----+----+----+----+----| buffer areas which nobody can build on, and have
 |XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX| monster infestations.
 |XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|
 |XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX| The total size of the lots has not been determined
 |XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX| at time of writing.
 |----+----+----+----+----|
 |XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|
 |XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|
 |XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|
 |XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|
 *------------------------*

The home base includes one item- a block ejector. This is a vehicle which
serves the purpose of depositing additional terrain blocks (at a cost) so that
players can design and fortify their home base.

* OPERATIONS
For a player without a home base, the realm is similar to any other- they can
show up and help kill the wandering creatures within. If a player encounters
a fortification, they can elect to defend it, or alternately try to destroy it.
The owner of the fortification can view a log which shows the very basic 
actions which other players have made on their territory.
