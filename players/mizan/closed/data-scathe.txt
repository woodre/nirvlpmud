Situation:
Data and Scathe had a wizard to wizard (pissing match) late Dec of 2003.
This in it's self is fine with me since I can not control or regulate
wizards acting like there position warrants them to.  Data and then
proceeded to place a mob in the same room as Noirceur which killed him.
Noirceur brought this incident to the attention of Aingeal.  Aingeal and
Scathe/Noirceur apparently have had personal issues/problems in the past and
Aingeal decided it would be better to refer the matter to another PA wizard
(Puppy.)  Puppy spoke with all people involved to gain more info.

Findings:
-Date cloned a non aggressive mob into the same room as Noirceur
-The mob would not have attacked Noirceur had he not input commands for it
to do so (if mob is kicked/punched/etc... 5 or more times it will attack the
player) this was verified with the code owner and his logs (Mizan)

Results:
-Noirceur's death is to stand since in the end it was his actions that
caused his own death
-Scathe and Data will avoid contact with each others players and wizard chars unless
there is a "business need" for the wizard to handle a situation
-Data is to place no item in a players inventory or in a public room of the
game
-If another similar incident such as this happens again Pain will look into
the process for dewizzing the offending wizard
