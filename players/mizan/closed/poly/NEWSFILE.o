We took in a lot of warriors and probably a few symbiotes when their guilds closed. They have done a good job as polys for the most part and it was nice seeing more people around. However I know a few of themwere polys before the warriors and I especially know the ones whom I had to edit them back into Spuck's good graces were. The point of this note is that I'm not going to be quite so swift to invite in the next time. We have an open door policy for new members but if you have been and then ditched us for a more powerful guild I'm not going to bend over to let you back in. This is just a for instance and applies to bailing out for other guilds as well.

Right nowthe first phase is that people who are over a certain level, withunfavorable push-to-tug ratios will be flat out denied the abilityto tug new items.The next phase, the composite value of what is being pushed/tuggedwill be checked. Other little tweaks will be done to keep it frombeing abused. I really hate to do this, but watching how some peopleconstantly keep the tug filled while others mooch away at it irealized that this behavior needs to come to a stop.Bear in mind that i hold tug/push offenses fairly high in disregard.No real specifics need to be mentioned about how it works and whatis considered a 'bad thing'. I'll leave common sense for you to judgeon that level.-mMizan**[Mizan, Mon Oct 13 22:21:03 2003]  Polymorph Treehouse:**Polymorph Treehouse just got a bit more interesting.It has been pointed out that we have a catapultin there but nothing to shoot with.That has now been addressed.have fun!-mMizan**[Mizan, Tue Oct 14 09:44:17 2003]  Spuckball, Spucktrooper- gobble all, spew all:**You can now 'gobble all' or 'spew all' in Spuckball and Spucktrooperforms.

Luring lower level players into open PK realms isa sure fire way to get us an undeserved reputation as a newbiekilling machine. In the past I have banned players from the guildoutright.As punishment I gave the offender two choices.1) They can quit the guild, and nobody has to deal with this    unpleasantness, and the issue is dropped.2) They can stay in the guild, but everyone else has to suffer for   it.

Upon arrival atthe Pearly Gates, St. Peter tells them that they are a]l admitted. Hec]utions them, though, that there is only one rule: Don't step on theB]anos. The men all have blank expressions, and finally one of them asks\"]he Beanos?\". \"Yes\", St. Peter replies, \"there are millions of Beanosu] here walking around and, if one gets stepped on, he gwaks th]n theone next to him gwaks and soon they're all raising hell and i] reallybreaks the tranquility. If you step on the Beanos, you'll be punished,otherwise everything is you're to enjoy.\"  After entering, the men noted that there was indeed a gaggle of Beanoseverywhere. Within fifteen minutes, one of the guys stepped on one oft]em. The Beano gwakked, the one next to it gwakked and soon there was ad]afening roar of Beano gwaks. St. Peter walked up with an extremelyhomely woman in tow and asked \"Who stepped on the Bea]o?\". The one whohad done it admitted \"I did.\" Immediately, St. Peter ]ulled out a pairof handcuffs and cuffed the mans' right hand to the homely womans' lefthand. \"I told you not to step on the Beanos\", he said. \"Now you'll behandcuffed together for eternity.  The other two men were very cautious not to]step on any Beanos, but a]ouple of weeks later, one of them accidentally did. The gwaks were asdeafening as before and within minutes St. Peter walked up with an evenu]li]r woman than before. St. Peter determined which one had stepped on]a Beano by the fear in his face, and cuffed the mans' right hand to thehomely womans' left hand. \"I told you not to step on the Beanos\", he]said.]\"Now you'll be handcuffed together for eternity.\"  The third man was extremely careful. Some days]he wouldn't even move for]ear of even nudging a Beano. After three months of this he still hadn'ts]epped on a Beano. St. Peter walked up to the man at the end of thethree months and had with him a knock-out gorgeous woman, the mostbeautiful woman the man had ever seen. St. Peter smiled to the]man andthen, without a word, handcuffed him to]the beautiful woman and walkedoff. The man, knowing that he would be handcuffed to this woman for]et]rnity, let out a sigh and said \"What have I done to deserve this\"?  The woman responded \"I don't know about you, but I ste]ped on a Beano.\" Mizan**[Mizan, Sat Aug 11 02:02:31 2001]  oops:**Cut and paste didn't work right on that one.

In fact the'guild' teleport that we have almost didn't make the cut, so i weakenedit by design so it had a limited range.Also if i were to code a teleport ability, a player 'goto' thing is highlyfrowned upon unless it had a way of confirming at the destination thatthe teleport is allowed. The reason for this is to prevent abuse for the'gotoer' if the destination is in a hotel room or someother secluded place.So we won't have any sort of teleport ability anytimesoon :)Just an explanation of the dealio...-mizMizan**[Forbin, Wed Aug 29 00:22:19 2001]  tug idea:**I was thinking...I was thinking...(obviously not about how to type)I like the new tug system all but 1 thing...the fact that(if i am not mistaken) that each time you tug, you getdeducted for all the things in tug, and when you pushback you get credit for all the things there.Why not have tug where (since we can see with tug list)you can tug or push individual objects...I think that theratings will be more representative that way - just asuggestion...cause i dunno if tug is deliberately setfor a mass withdraw/deposit...but i do think it wouldbe a lot cleaner if one could tug out just what theyneeded...instead of all the things...Of course, you might have to adjust the tug sps cost.  Oryou could just make it possible to type a command like:tug web, helm, sword of spirits, iron bracers and be chargedone time for all of them together...(if that is even possibleto code).Anyways...just another 2 cents worth from me...ForbinForbin**[Mizan, Wed Aug 29 23:22:48 2001]  Tug/Push:**I plan on moving push and tug to a more single-item setup like a lockerinstead of this whole blanket pull-push deal.The new changes in stats just dont really work for the system, Forbin iscorrect in that.

I am considering making an implementation where people can onlyassume morph forms a certain number of times per _day_. For example youcan only tetrapod 5 times in a 24 hour period. Other forms would be moreplentiful such as bogglemancer or spucktrooper.I realize that something like this might not really rub off as agood thing to people. It seems like i am clamping down when I am not.Other ideas that were tossed around were making it so that in order totetrapod you have to assume another morph form first- such as Golem. It madesense in the real world as in if you wanted to fly the F16, you had tospend time in the trainer first. However this idea sucks in that it restrictswhat you can morph into. I don't want to do that. I want there to be freedomin what you can choose, but limit only how long you can be there.(cont. on next post)Mizan**[Mizan, Wed Aug 29 23:31:16 2001]  Potential Massive Changes (2):**Bear in mind that I don't like to just take things away.

If we all used the other formsmore, we'd most likely realize all the work Mizan does to keep thisthe coolest guild on the mud - and we'd probably find out ther welike the puffball or bogglemancer or whatever just as good (maybemore) than tetra.  But if you invest your xp in a guild, you reallyshouldn't be given a lot of restrictions on your earned abilities.I mean - I LOVE WUMPUS!  I really think that you should leave wellenough alone - if someone likes tetrapod, let 'em use it all theywant - that's why we spend our hard-earned xp in the first place.But in light of my keep it as it is stance, here are some otherideas/thoughts to think about:********** continued on next post:  Form Limits #2 **********Forbin**[Forbin, Thu Aug 30 16:55:53 2001]  Form Limits #2:**PROPOSAL #1This is sort of similar to the extra levels that you can get onceyou reach level 19 - you know, 19+1, 19+2, etc.  It involves usingmore experience to advance in the guild, but it might be worth it.A given polymorph guild member would, upon reaching each level, beallowed to morph into each form _no_more_ than 5 times in any 24hour period.  (This will keep the penalty from being assessed onlyto the multi-limbed forms)  Once you reach level 5, you can beginto advance higher in BONUS levels.  Each bonus level allows you topolymorph one extra time per form.  Example - a guild level 5+2 polywould be able to change into a puffball, tetra, tree, etc. 7 times in agiven 24 hour period.  Here are my thoughts on the levels and the xpthey should/could take:Guild Level 5+1     1 extra morph     450,000Guild Level 5+1     2 extra morphs    550,000Guild Level 5+3     3 extra morphs    650,000Guild Level 5+4     4 extra morphs    800,000Guild Level 5+U     unlimited      1,000,000********** continued on next post:  Form Limits #3 **********Forbin**[Forbin, Thu Aug 30 17:01:49 2001]  Form Limits #3:**PROPOSAL #2:This method is most likely easier to code, although I favor myfirst idea.If you set the limit on _each_form_ (not just multi-limbed) to 5, youcould possible allow extra morphing (past 5) by forcing the 6ht, 7th,etc. times you morph require ALL 2300 charges, instead of the normalcosts associated with a given form.PROPOSAL #3:You could instead add some sort of 'morph error', so that if you aremorphing into, let's say tetra, and the error occursm you morph intoa random level 5 form.  If you are morphing into a bogglemancer and getan error, you morph into a random level 5 form.  It would work levelby level - a level 3 error would give you a level 3...you wouldn't trymorphing into a level 5 and end up with a level 1 form...but that is apossibility also.Well - I just wanted to start the sounding board adn get some ideasflowing around...But I'd just keep it the way it is and allow curiosity and nature totake its own course.FORBINForbin**[Trpsprngr, Thu Aug 30 17:21:28 2001]  CHANGES  (massive):**I've heard \"the tetrapod guild\" before - and I'llprobably hear it again.  The reason it is used somuch is it's relatively low-maintenance - solid damage without needing to cast/worry about sps.The Tetrapod is basically the Ultimate SoloFighting Machine[tm]  In parties, I'd be hardpressed for a reason to not have a Tetra leadingas well.  Puffball is the Ultimate Damage SidekickMorph though - try it sometime.  Shiver.I don't want to see the guild as \"the tetra club\"either, but frankly without some type of limiterit's just the way it's going to be.  One of thethings I have thought about was to make it so thateach form can only be assumed by one person at atime - For instance if there's someone on as atetrapod, nobody else can use that form until theyrevert.  This has some bad spots, of course - lastthing I'd want to see is \"tetra-war\" over who getsto use the form.  It would either force us to usea variety of forms - and probably partying with eachother more - or it would cause a large amount ofinfighting.  While I'd like to think we could getalong, I kind of doubt it would work out that way.So, this is my Big Idea - How about after reverting(or being forced to revert) you cannot assume thatform again for the amt of time that morph lasts.That would probably encourage others to use otherforms, at least for the 1/2 hr in between eachtetrapod use.  :)  In any case, it would be betterthan only being able to use the form so many timesin a day.gronk!*-* Uncle Trpsprngr *-***[Mizan, Sat Sep  1 03:06:18 2001]  Excellent stuff:**These are really excellent ideas...Very thought provoking by the way. I have not hadto really consider things on this game scale for a while, and its a goodchallenge :)I think i have figured out this whole thing, obviously with feedback fromthose who contributed above. The new morph system will look like this:Each morph form has a reactivity timer associated with it. For exampleSpuckball is 3 minutes, while tetrapod is 30 minutes.Once you morph into a Tetrapod, and revert, you will be unable to assumethat form for another 30 minutes. The clay will tell you when you canreassume that form.In addition to this, each form has a maximum quanta associated with it ofhow many times you can morph into something within a 24 hour period. Thedemarcation is the game clock, at midnight. This of course varies with eachform.If you _really_ want to morph the form and you have exceeded your quanta forthe day, you have to wait for the next day. There is no getting around thesetimers. I will do my best to assign values which are fair without beinginsane about it.(continued on next post)Mizan**[Mizan, Sat Sep  1 03:13:46 2001]  Excellent stuff (2):**People have given me very good ideas and equally impressive insight on thingshappening in the guild.

Death. What happens when you have a tetra form being used and die? You not only lose the use of that form for the day, but you also have to wait to get the tetra back while giving the thing you were killing valuable time to heal up. What is really bothersome is getting killed by something 5 minutes into a tetra especially if it is your last time for the night. Sure, I use 1 other form and thats replicant and thats cause the other forms dont equal the damage I can make while normal. But what needs to be done is so that if death occurs you would be brought back in the form you died in, since having wait times and form limits umbalances this factor making it unfair as well as even hard to get back a corpse amd giving potential thiefs time to rob all your goods. Even though my corpse didnt get looted the first 4 times, I couldnt get my corpse the 5th time due to a very hard kill blocking the entrance to the area, just balance out the limits if death accurs.VodkaVodka**[Dent, Wed Jan 30 16:34:25 2002]  Re: calm at the green:**Bite me.Bite me.People shouldn't fight at the green.

We are finally migrated to mob.c:**Oof. I almost don't know where to begin. First an update on something thathas happened which will have a fairly major impact on how the morphs existin this guild. This discussion assumes a knowledge in some programmingprinciples so if you get confused don't worry. This will be a multipartmessage.The old forms were independently coded. If I wanted a new multilimbed formfor example i basically copied from my tetrapod.c file and cloned thefunctionality line by line to the new form. This made for management problemsif I had lots of morph forms, as a bug with one multilimb form most likelyhad to be fixed by hand on all the others.The new mob engine (morph, not monster object) consolidates all of the majorfunctions for morphing into an object which can be easily templated justlike a monster, for those of you familiar with LPC code. For example, a snip:....inherit \"mob.c\";reset(arg){   if(arg) return;   ::reset();   set_short_desc(\"A dark granite sphere\");   set_long_desc(\"You look into the sphere and see a dark, stony face\\n\"+      \"staring right back.\\n\"+      \"The sphere your current polymorph as a golem.\\n\");   set_helpfile(\"golem\");   set_multilimbed(1, 2);   set_reversion_time(3200);   set_block_say();   set_block_magic();   ... etc. I think the developer crowd out there gets how much of a quantum leap thiscan mean for creating, managing, and testing morph forms.-mizMizan**[Oolabob, Sun Nov 18 19:44:32 2001]  Gawd:**Ugh I need to come back when I can scroll and read my echo-ed text an shit.
