VERY IMPORTANT: 

*CLARIFICATION* The PK restriction i am talking about is in regards
to wandering in PK areas, not the ability to PK other players.
Please check the recenty news articles in guild.announce for details.

The PK restriction has been lifted. This issue is closed and dealt 
with. Please read the updated information in: 'info playerkilling',
'info playerkilling2', and lastly 'info playerkilling3'. I plan on
really ironing down the language because i have no choice in it, so
these documents will be subject to further changes and clarifications.

Sorry things have to be this way. Please read the news for
further detail. The effects of a single person not thinking
things through, and then being unrepentant about it has forced
me to act like this :(
