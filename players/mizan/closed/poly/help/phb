[PHB] Level [6] 400 charges (+sta, ---int, ++mag, +str, -ste, ++luck)

  What does PHB mean? Of course it stands for the universally feared
  'Pointy Haired Boss'. Regarded as one of the most fiercly cruel and
  savage of its kind, the PHB is a hallmark of terror and frustration
  to its opponents. If there is anything to stop it, perhaps the
  PHB's incredible lack of intelligence is its Achilles' Heel.
  The PHB is frequently found wearing a suit and tie purchased at an
  extreme discount, or ridiculously hideous prices.
