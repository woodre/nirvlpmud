[SPIRAL] Level [6] 1400 charges (-sta, +int, ++mag, --str, -ste, ++luck)
         (Female only morph form)
         
  To assume the form of Spiral is to gain an overwhemling psychological
  edge on your would-be opponents, as well as one heck of a physical
  advantage. The sight alone of a hellbent enchantress wielding
  several weapons at once and casting fireballs may be too much to for
  most mortal men to bear! For all of Spiral's brute magical power and
  dizzying attacks, her main drawback is lack of physical strength,
  and the necessity to connect numerous hits before building up
  momentum in combat.
  

>>-------------------------------ABILITIES-------------------------------<<

strap <weapon>   Wield a weapon offhand. You can strap up to five weapons,
strap all        plus wielding one primary. To cast fireballs you must have
                 at least one limb free.

unstrap <weapon> Remove a weapon wielded offhand.

multihit         (120 sp) Attack everything in the room at once. This works
                 best if there are as many targets as as you have limbs,
                 or fewer. Players will not be attacked.

switch  <plyr>   (20 sps) Switch places with a player that is fighting
                 something.   

swords           (variable sps) Dancing swords... convert all of the weapons
                 you are strapping into lethal missiles! (They all fly
                 out and assault whatever you are currently attacking).
                 WARNING: Be sure to use this ability when your spellpoints
                 are near maximum to get an optimal effect.
xpower           (max sp) Use all of your spell points to direct a fierce
                 attack on whatever you are fighting. Note: This ability
                 requires ALL of your spell points to work.
