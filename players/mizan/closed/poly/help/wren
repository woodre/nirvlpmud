<<Info Wren>>

This is spot where I'm going to try to list things I've tampered
with for the improvement of this guild. And to mention files that 
were current and then lost in shuffle.

Rules documentation has been updated. Playerkilling and Notice have
been superceeded by 

			 info policy1, policy2, policy3.


These stands of mine have been approved by the admins so those
will be what we live with for now. Please be familiar with them.
