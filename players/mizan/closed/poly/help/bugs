>> KNOWN BUGS AND ERRATA

The following is a list of known bugs. If you don't see one here
please contact Mizan.



>>Monster Second Life Bug-----------------------------------------<<

FREQUENCY: LOW RISK           AFFECTS: Morphed multilimbed forms

When fighting a monster and it drops to 0/10 HP it will sometimes
respawn to 3/10 of its hitpoints! Also you will lose your abilities
to make extra hits!


SOLUTION: This has been addressed for the most part. It should not
happen again but i am documenting it here for posterity. The only
solution is to RUN AWAY and revert.


>>Revert Fail Bug-------------------------------------------------<<

FREQUENCY: LOW RISK           AFFECTS: Morphed multilimbed forms

Sometimes the automatic revert will fail. You will remain polymorphed
as a tetrapod, wumpus, or golem.


SOLUTION: Same as above. This bug has been fixed but remains here for
posterity.


>>Hitpoint/Spellpoint Lossage When 'guild fix'ing-----------------<<

FREQUENCY: COMMON             AFFECTS: Everyone

HP/SP would reduce dramatically when 'guild fix' occurred.

SOLUTION: This bug has been fixed.
