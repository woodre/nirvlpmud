>> THEME


  There actually is a general theme behind this guild, it sounds a bit too
far-fetched but its true. The members are individuals with the ability to
absorb energy/matter, project (nonliving) energy/matter, and manipulate
the matter/energy _of their own form_. No extramagick abilities, no
teleportation of matter/energy, no ability to create living things or
create new, stable forms of matter and detach them from the creator's
body. Did that make sense? If it did, that's what the entire guild is
based on. If you have an idea for a new spell and it breaks any of those
rules, it has very little possibility of becoming reality unless it has
a very, very good reason.
