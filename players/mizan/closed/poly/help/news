[NEWS]

  Instead of a stationary bulletin board, the guild uses a very simple,
  mobile, and passive news system. You can use the news functions
  anywhere on the mud, anytime. The commands are listed as such:


Nh             See headers/topics in current newsgroup.
Np <topic>     Post a message in the current newsgroup.
Nr <x>         Read message number <x> in current newsgroup.
Nd <x>         Delete message number <x> in current newsgroup.
Ng <x>         Goto news group number <x> (Nh for numbers of groups).
Nl             List all available newsgroups.
Nn             Go to next newsgroup.

  You can also use 'toggle news' to toggle a posting completion message.
