  Killing pets of other players: Doing so is regarded as an act similar to
  vandalism. You are destroying someone else's property. It is not an act
  that is recommended, in keeping within the guild's theme of a chaotic
  good alignment. Failure to observe this will cause the guild wizards to
  be sad with you. Issues of this nature are handled on a case by case basis.

  Killing kids of other players: Similar to above. Kids however are weighed
  in as being higher value property and accordingly the sadness is increased.

  Arranging player deaths: Arranging or being accomplice to another player's
  death on the MUD is generally a neutral issue. It's your business if
  dealing with players of equal or higher level than you.

  However arranging for a lower level player of considerable EXP or level 
  difference is highly disregarded and can cause you to be banished from
  the guild. This situation is handled case by case. Arranging death includes
  some of the following as a guideline; Abandonment in PK zones, booby traps,
  explosive devices, diseases, radiative devices, wizard traps, falsehoods,
  or any sort of process that causes a lower level player to die.

  Contract killings: Not acceptable against players of considerably lower
  EXP or level. See above. Same terms apply.

  Revenge killings: Issues where polymorphs have been killed by other players
  in open PK realms, revenge is a dish best served cold. I prefer not to 
  delve in the technicalities of things, but it can be inferred that Charles
  Bronson 'Death Wish' style rules are not applicable. An eye for an eye,
  tooth for a tooth level of retribution is entirely appropriate.
