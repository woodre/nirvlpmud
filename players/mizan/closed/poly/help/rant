>>    <RANT_MODE>

I really hate to have to spell this out but circumstances have
forced me to do it. Due to a steadily increasing stream of
complaints (which i see as whining) about the nature of guild tug,
and the repeated instances where i see a L19 mooching for stuff
on vibe, here goes:

Too many people here are only thinking about themselves selfishly.
By this i mean higher level players who hoard equipment and ignore
the pleas of lower level players who ask for it.

Dont forget. I have the stat command. I can see your entire
inventory's worth. No objects escape blanket sweeping scans.
Consider that lower levellers are not as capable of getting
equips so help them out. When you lie about 'i dont have money'
and I see it, my evaluation of you drops to O.J. like proportions.

By this i DONT MEAN A WELFARE STATE. 

There is a saying that if you give a fish to a man he will eat for
a day. But if you teach him to fish then he will never go hungry.

I hate having to resort to a parable like that, but that attitude
is what i expect from higher levels.

As for lower levels, you arent in the clear either. I dont want to
see mindless begging, the same pitted disrespect i have to hoarding
can be worked in your way as well.

Let's have some mutual cooperation, folks. I like things to be
loose and happy here, this isnt my rant against that, its my rant
against material selfishness and an intolerable indifference towards
one another.
