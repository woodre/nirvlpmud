[BLOBEL] Level [3] 330 charges (-sta, +int, +mag, --str, -ste, luck unch.)

  The blobel is as close to an interdimensional magical being that
  retains a normal physical form as you're going to get. Capable of
  dealing with communications and vibrations from a mind-boggling
  array of perspectives and dimensions, it takes a strong, anti-
  schizophrenic mind to withstand being a blobel...

>>-------------------------------ABILITIES-------------------------------<<

confusion <monster> (30 sps) Mentally assault a monster by dropping
                    a cluster of extradimensional energy into the
                    creature's brain. Translation: Drive the bastard nuts!


unfrog <plyr>       Remove the frog curse from someone. Only really used
                    in very rare situations.


tuck <item>         Spods the item into the guild room. Sort of an extra-
                    dimensional deposit. Note that it does NOT push the item
                    into the ether-muck automatically.


radar <creature>    Tracks the movement of another creature, and reports
                    change of environment to the guild channel. Very wicked
                    for those team gangbang situations.


deepsurvey          (5 sps) Similar to standard survey, but reports some more
                    info about monsters in surrounding rooms.
                    This ability has a profound effect when used in the jello.


memorize            Memorize your current location.. so you can blink
                    to it later.

Blink               (50 sp) Blink to the location you had memorized previously.
