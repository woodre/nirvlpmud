[PUFFERFISH] Level [1] 10 charges (--sta, --int, --mag, --ste, ++luck)

    Being a pufferfish is rather interesting. Basically you
    assume the form of a grouchy, poisonous little beast
    that monsters know better than to pick a fight. Well. Thats
    the good thing about being a puffer. The bad thing is that you
    dont have the physique to fight back or anything
    and emotions are hard to express.
