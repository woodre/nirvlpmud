[GUILD]


  Without arguments, this command will allow you to 'step' into the
  guild 'base' with one command. Be warned, the physical range of
  this command is rather short since polymorphs cannot really 'teleport'
  using normal means.


Usage:  guild [escape]

 escape   'guild escape' is the same as typing 'guild'.



Other uses are:


guild fix                  Fix your guild object if an error occurs.

guild RETIRE!              Leave the guild permanently! *sniff*

guild save                 Save your player and guild stats

guild tell/guild vibe      Chat with other members of the guild.

guild who                  See who else is logged on in the guild.



You can do a 'info guild fix' for example to see more information about

each specific command.
