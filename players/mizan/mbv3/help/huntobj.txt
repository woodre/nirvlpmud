>> ORDER: HUNT ATTACK OBJECT

Usage:
order <indexnum> hunt <creature> <duration>

Example:
'order 3 hunt mizan 10'

Description:
This is a very straightforward command. The monster is sent in 
to hunt a creature and fight it to the death. Pretty much a no-brainer :)

Be aware that like all teleport capabilities of the smart monsters, 
this checks against realm() being NT, as well as rooms having a
query_no_fight() property.
