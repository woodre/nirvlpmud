>> ORDER: PROTECT CREATURE

Usage:
order <index> protect <object> <duration>

Example:
order 3 protect mizan 100

Description:
This order tells the monster to protect another creature, which will
be either a raw object passed to it (when used by the monster code) 
or a string, which converts to the first find_player() and then 
find_living() which matches.
