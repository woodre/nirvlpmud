>> ORDER: LOITER NEAR SPOT

Usage:
order <index> loiter <string roomfile> <duration>

Example:
order 3 loiter room/church 10

This order instructs the monster to wander near the general vicinity
of the room filename specified to it. The monster generally does not
wander more than five hops or so away from its loiter position, and 
will teleport back to it automatically in a normal, periodic fashion.
