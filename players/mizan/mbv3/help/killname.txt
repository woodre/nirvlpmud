>> ORDER: KILL BY NAME

Usage:
order <index> killname <string name> <duration>

Example:
'order 3 killname mizan 10'

Description:
This order tells the monster to continue its standard wandering, 
but to kill any creature that reports to the id matching the string
that is fed to the order. 

Note that currently the command does not support monsters with spaces
in their names. Player names do not have this problem however.
