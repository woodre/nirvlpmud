>> ORDER: HOUND AND SHADOW ATTACK ON PLAYER

Usage:
order <indexnum> hound <creature> <duration>

Example:
'order 3 hound mizan 10'

Description:
This is a variation of the 'hitfade' order. Although not implied
this order is an attack capability. Therefore be careful if you
don't know what it does :)

Unlike the standard hit and fade, the monster waits until the target
in question has engaged in combat with another creature before making
its fade. Although very effective when the player is surprised, 
most players will figure out the modus operandi of this attack and 
prepare counter strikes against it.

This attack is utilized by the less fearless monsters in the guild.
