>> ORDER: HARRASS

Usage:
order <indexnum> harrass <creature> <duration>

Example:
'order 3 harrass mizan 10'

Description:
This command issued to a monster turns it essentially into a massive
pest. Even if the shit fling flag is not set, the monster will hurl
shit, and emote harrassment incessantly.

Be aware that the monster will stalk the player, following it, and make
life generally uncomfortable. It should be used very sparingly. Also
don't use high level instablick monsters. It's just not cool.
