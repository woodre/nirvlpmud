>> ORDER: HITFADE ATTACK OBJECT BY NAME

Usage:
order <indexnum> hitfadename <creature> <duration>

Example:
'order 3 hitfadename mizan 10'

Description:
Similar to the 'hitfade' order, this operates on a more aggravating
level in that the player name is tracked, not the player object.

When a player quits out, and re-logs in they will still be subject 
to the attack of the monster. Truly evil stuff, and the preferred 
form of attack for the more cruel of the monsters.
