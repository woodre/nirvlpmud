>> Driving - How to Drive

Your vehicle has three main roles, each with uniquely different capacities and
responsibilities. A description is illustrated below:

Driving your vehicle takes some practice. First you must know how to start
and stop the engine on the vehicle. See 'read engine' to see more about that
topic.

Assuming that you are the driver, and the engine is now started, you need to
give the command 'drive' to begin driving. Once you are driving, you are
given a series of command prompts. All of these commands are now applied
directly to the vehicle. Available commands are any exits in the room,
and 'look'. You can also 'look at' a limited selection of things.

To stop the driving session, give the command '*' (star).

Also, a bonus tip- if you want to run commands for yourself instead of
driving, put an exclamation point in front of your command. For example,
"!tell mizan hey, i'm driving". Be aware that you shouldn't drive while
being distracted, you might cause an accident and get people KILLED.
