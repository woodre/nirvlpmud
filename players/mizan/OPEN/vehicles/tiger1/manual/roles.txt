>> Operation Roles

Your vehicle has three main roles, each with uniquely different capacities and
responsibilities. A description is illustrated below:

Driver     - The person responsible for navigating and operating the vehicle
             through various terrains and conditions.
Passenger  - Also known as the commander, the passenger is responsible for
             keeping an eye on overall tactical situation and managing the
             rest of the staff onboard.
Cargo      - The cargo section contains passengers or plain old cargo. They
             may have defensive roles on board as well, depending on your
             vehicle's model type.

To assume a role, give the command 'be driver' or 'be passenger', or 
'be cargo'vwhen you have boarded the vehicle. Using the 'look' command 
informs you of who may be filling the current roles.
