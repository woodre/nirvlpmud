>> Hatch Operation

The hatch should be fairly intuitive to operate. It can be opened and
closed with the commands:

and
'close door'

Anyone can open and close the hatch from the inside or outside.
The hatch can be locked or unlocked from the outside.
In order to get in, a key is needed. The commands used are:

'unlock door'
and
'lock door'
