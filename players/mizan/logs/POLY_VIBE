entered...unless shards have a lead commnad
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m command
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m what a bunch of bull shit
[1m[34m>> (vibe)[0m Sin nods.
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m I think we should be allowed to kill guild mobs
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m welll
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m yes
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m i agreer
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m cuz shardak would be dead faster than a shardak can
crap
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m i also think t
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m that we should be able to go in groups into pk
areas, and if one of us gets attacked by a plater we can all attack
that player
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m heh
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m us protecting our guild
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m but we cant really pk like that
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m yeah i know
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m I think that no matter what...what a guild can do to
us we should be able to do to them
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m im gonna go afk for abit, i need to shower
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m yeah totally
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m they can kill spuck at anytime and we cant do
anything
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m have they done it before?
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m yeah
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m its been done
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m well your not allowed to kill guild mobs, and
spuck isn't easily killable.
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m he is in numbers
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m 3 or 4 people can take em down...a bf could take em
down
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m but it would be nice if we could somehow "help"
spuck
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m yeah it would
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m hand em shit and he uses it to heal himself
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m just because some guild sengage in such actions
doesn't make it ok for polys to do so.
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m or else spuck could turn into a tetrapod
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m that would be intresting
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m if you want to wack another guilds mobs you'll
get the boot from here.
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m if you want to kill other guidls mobs, log on a
char in a guidl that can do that.
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m wantin...and doin though are two different things
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m I have done that
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m agreed
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m but then thats as bad as a pker logging on a higher
level pker to get even with who pked him
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m two wrongs don't make it wright.
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m same as always :)
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m MT
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m true, but not doing anything is also not right
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m therefore a solution needs to be came upon for
dealing with situations when the arise
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m rules are rules, Mizan makes the laws in here,
so buck up and enjoy it
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m and truthfully im not that evil of a person to think
up of anything decent atleast when it comes to shardaks
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m all I know is kill their gmob...and thats all I know
what to do...they dont use kids...if I see a dragon I kill it
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m not sure if killing pets is allowed.
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m its not in the rules
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m we can kill kids, its frowned upon though
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m polysd have strict rules on dealing wiht pets
and kids.
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m I see guild mobs...havent seen anything on pets and
kids
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m not like im a fan of it...I just believe in
recompensation
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m the last time I killed worm's dragon twice cause he
was using it to hand me blockbusters
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m that kind of action is fine, it's being used to
bother.
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m not really...the action was meant to knock me into a
pk room
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m but as far as killing guild mobs, thats an act
of guild wars.  Shardaks don't go about wacking spuch constantly.  So
drop that kind of talk.
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m er spuck
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m what if they do start?
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m Ignore them.
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m They do things to goad you into a pk situation.
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m if they can bag a poly, so much better for them,
in their eyes.
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m no one has goaded me into a pk ever
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m someone who are you?
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m would be interesting if it was wren
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m hes the only poly I know of that wized
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m i know jamilla can read our channel too
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m oh yeah jamila
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m there has been a few wizards who wizzed from
polys
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m but hses been talkin on star...and it would be a
pain in the butt to go from seeable to invis to us
[1m[34m>> Jamila vibes:[0m yea not me sorry guys
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m lol we know its all good
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m im just curious
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m heh we both are
[1m[34m>> Razzel vibes:[0m because you cant even finger someone to find out
who he, or she, is
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m if someone is so active with polys...I wanna know so
I can mail them of any problems
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m nope
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m used to be long ago you could figure it out with the
finger
[1m[34m>> Jamila vibes:[0m heh
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m help guilds to find out who to mail.
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m but I blabbed my skills of figuring out who someone
was and they changed it eventually lol
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m I was offered polys, but I really don't want to
bother with mizan code ;)
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m heh ive seen mizan code first hand...
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m and it is hard to understand
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m took me awhile to figure out the color portion
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m so the poly files...I would imagine would be alot
worse
[1m[34m>> Jamila vibes:[0m i should really learn how to code more
[1m[34m>> Jamila vibes:[0m so i'm of some use
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m you already are of some use jamila
[1m[34m>> Jamila vibes:[0m bah one area done that is not used because its
for noobs isn't nothing

[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m Less WoW more work jamila
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m I think its the location of it
[1m[34m>> Jamila vibes:[0m laf i can't even play wow until i get more ram
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m too many castles in that area make it confusing
[1m[34m>> Jamila vibes:[0m i max out at 45 mins...
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m I would say do something like what forbin
did...started out 10e of fred's then he made an extra room
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m so it turned into 11e of fred's area
[1m[34m>> Jamila vibes:[0m nah its just the area isn't worth going to
[1m[34m>> Jamila vibes:[0m its a way noob area
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m I'm sure necros frequent it.
[1m[34m>> (vibe)[0m Sin nods.

useful

[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m hard to believe, bu tthe True Deathmaster Snikch
is alot more nasty.
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m heh
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m the only thing I could say is that if your gonna
force a reversion, then refund their form for the day
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m otherwise no one will want to kill it as a poly
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m and if a legend poly cant take em down, then its
just gonna be decoration
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m cause it would probally take everyone in a party, 30
people to kill
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m and you cant add that many to a party
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m probably need more than one
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m A well prepared party can kill him in short
order.
[1m[34m>> Someone vibes:[0m The same bloodfists he wiped out got pay back
later once they regrouped.
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m but also to counter that from being abused, when
they change into a form it resumes from the time they had left

[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m be glad you didnt
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m nah I am lieing, but I do know how to get
there now
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m I dont suggest doing deathmaster till you can do
mondar solo without calming, not to mention have aliases set so you
can cast blitz 10 times a round or more
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m out the general directions
[1m[34m>> (vibe)[0m Sin nods.
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m like I told you last night, I can't push the
button that many time, I have an alias set for blitz though
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m and heals
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m heh dont need to hit the button but once to do it
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m now please do explain how I can hit one
button and make 10 blitzes go off at once
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m your using gmud right?
[1m[34m>> (vibe)[0m Springdawn nods
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m edit, aliases
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m type in an alias name, go to the box for the input
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m blitz, return, blitz, return
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m ok
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m or in my case since ya need dark tetrapod to kill
him
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m apply sphere, return, crhit, return, crhit, return,
blitz, return, blitz, return
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m so if I type sp, it will do all that
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m do I type the word return
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m no, you hit the return/enter key
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m so it goes to the line under what you got for
commands
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m ok but you can only do crhit when something
is down to 0 I though
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m exactly
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m if he isnt weak enough it will just say he isnt weak
enough
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m in this way you dont have to worry about typing it
manually, or using a blitz to take sp when crhit coulda finished him
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m ok I had one alias set up for apply sphere,
blitz and eat fruit
[1m[34m>> (vibe)[0m Sin nods
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m for the one that is for apply sphere
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m and that is how I did it last night
[1m[34m>> (vibe)[0m Sin nods.
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m although with me, I change my healing alias alot
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m if im goin against deathmaster ever again, I set my
normal healing command to be like the other commands so I use up blitz
after every healing
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m so I did the fight the old fashion way?
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m yeah kinda
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m isn't that good in away
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m this is just my way of doing things, other people
still do it the old fasion way, some people even use triggers but you
wouldnt be able to tell
[1m[34m>> Springdawn vibes:[0m triggers aren't suppose to be allowed
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m most triggers used though is like an auto loot and
auto use corpse thing, but even then that is still illegal
[1m[34m>> Sin vibes:[0m people used to get jailed just for having a trigger
set up for when they idle to keep them from getting auto logged off

[1m[34m>> Mizan vibes:[0m i built the area with cheating in mind- in that
someone, somehow would find some bug and want to exploit it to kill
[1m[34m>> Mizan vibes:[0m the area probably cannot be solved under normal
means- it may be too large to traverse in a single boot cycle

[1m[34m>> Mizan vibes:[0m i know, i actually wanted to make it solveable
without resorting to BS
[1m[34m>> Tavenous rumbles:[0m Yeah. That makes sense.
[1m[34m>> Mizan vibes:[0m there are shortcuts in the maze
[1m[34m>> Mizan vibes:[0m but it is not obvious until someone does some
serious mapping
[1m[34m>> Tavenous rumbles:[0m I will solve! It's only a matter of TIME
[1m[34m>> Mizan vibes:[0m my next objective right now is to make the game
crashproof
[1m[34m>> Mizan vibes:[0m in the sense that full inventory is restored after

[1m[34m>> Mizan vibes:[0m i think i know (technically) how i would do it
[1m[34m>> Mizan vibes:[0m the stumbling block in the past was caused by
