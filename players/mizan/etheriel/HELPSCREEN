>>--------------------- Welcome to Etheriel ----------------------<<

    There are some functions added in to this area that make it very
different from anywhere else on the mud...

'bleat' is a special channel available only to those who are currently
  in the Plane of Etheriel. It behaves very much like 'gossip' and
  'shout' channels, etc.

>> bleat <msg>	Tell something to everyone who is currently in the area.
>> bleat :<msg>	Emotes over the channel.
>> bleat list	Displays who is currently in the castle.

>> jumpto <plyr>   [30 sps]
	Teleports you to <plyr> player, provided he/she/it is
        is currently in the realm.

>> wormhole <dest> [20 sps]
	Allows you to build a tunnel to <dest> destination.
        Experiment with it to figure out what is going on...

>> push <object> <destination> [variable sps]
        Pushes an object (any kind of object, as long as you can move it)
        to destination <roomname>. Kind of a strange command, useless but fun.

>> thinkto <plyr/monster> [8 sps]
        Determines the whereabouts of a living thing. Helpful if you get lost.

>> stir [20 sps]
        Stir up and reset the area you are currently in.

>> help jello	This screen.
