			     Welcome to Etheriel

    Welcome to me new area! It was designed with two ideas in mind:
 Originality and seamless player level integration. I hope it can be a
  place where everyone can roam around and fight side by side, not just
  a place where a certain 'caste' of players hang out. The lines between
  distinct newbie zones and high-level player slaughtergrounds have been
  intentionally blurred so that (hopefully) it makes the game more fun
  for everybody. Call me crazy, but I like to experiment...

    Just a few things I'd like to point out:

    If you drop something in this realm and leave it, even for a split
  second, it may disappear! C'est la vie! Such is the inherent risk of
  swimming-drifting-floating through an ever-changing Ether-Muck.

    New players: Don't worry about attacking the wrong kind of thing.
  It is advisable to inspect a monster before attacking it, but a series
  of checkstops have been enabled to keep you from getting senselessly
  slaughtered. Likewise, these checkstops prevent high-level players from
  stealing your kills, since they wont be able to attack easier monsters.


   Mid-level players: The level of difficulty was made with you in mind.
  most of the critters here fall into that bracket but beware: some of the
  monsters here dont just sit around and take shots. They fight intelligently.
  Also, the rooms are IMPOSSIBLE to map.

  P.S.: I'd appreciate ANY feedback on here, since this is essentially
    a new area etc. Keep in mind that whatever items seem totally harmless...
    ARE'NT! :)
