messages "Howdys[Mizan, Apr  3]:**>>--------------------- Welcome to Etheriel ----------------------<<Well... after many delays and things, my castle is finally open!I'm afraid that most of the people who were familiar with the old areaare all wizards by now, or left the mud entirely, but yes, I pulleda Morrissey stunt, delaying and delaying the area for weeks and weeks,during which time the castle size more than doubled, and the room driverquirks were worked out, and many minor tweaks that missed the uploadwere made.I tried my best to make this a unique area. It is different from otherplaces in two major ways: One is that I have eliminated the newbie-zonesand high-level slaughterhouses completely. All monsters difficultyregardless share the same space in this realm (Nothing is aggressive).Two: You will figure it out eventually. The differences are more radicalyet fit in a very subtle manner and are not what you have been ledto believe.To stop lower levelled players from being slaughtered unnecessarily bythe harder beasties that share the domain, I have installed a series ofcheckstops (This also *SHOULD* prevent higher level players from hoggingnewbie beasts as well). If perchance you see or are a victim of a high-leveller stealing your kill, let me know about it.. I'll attack thesituation PRONTO.(contd. on note #2)**Howdys [2][Mizan, Apr  3]:**Cont. from note 1Being that this is a new realm, and I wanted to experiment with havingbeasties of all difficulty levels mixed together, it is easy to attacksomething that seems perfectly harmless but instead is whipping your butt.The general rules of observation and common sense apply to whatever youare considering an attack on. Certain amibiguous monsters will sparelow-level players (e.g. A Boofer?) but others do not (like a greaterdemon or something) If I recieve enough complaints about the killinghere (e.g. LVL 1 Joebob getting wasted by a norkle in two rounds)I will change the system.Don't take anything seriously in here. The point is that you get abreak from reality (and normal muds) and your imagination takes over.I tried to put some effort into the describes and make this place somewhat stimulating to the grey matter.I hope you enjoy it. Flames/dares/ideas/typos/etc are welcome.-Miz**escaping the board, etc.[Mizan, Apr  3]:**The holograph/bulletin board is like any other, but it moves you toanother place when you're writing the note to minimize distractions.All of the environment noise from this room is muffled, so you can writemessages in peace (gossip, tells, and guild lines are another story).It should work out okay, but make sure if you're with other playersyou MUST have them unset their follow or things may get confusing.In the event you forget, anyone trapped inside can just go 'up'.-Miz**me again, *grin*[Mizan, Apr  3]:**I'm dead serious about people expressing honest opinions on this board...Whether or not you consider this area fun, just o.k., or a pudges against ppl because they writea note labelling this place as a 'shitboy putzing ground', etc. This board was designed to hold up to 100 messages for a reason :)*shrug*-Miz**Woo! Woo![Blodkuil, Apr 14]:**Hey Mizan love it its great can I get one to go?It's just like your area only better!Looooove it:)-Little cave girl BlodkuilPSWheres the boofers? :)**headline[Charles, Apr 30]:**wild trip manthis is the most wild place ive been in a long time man it kicks ass. keep up the good work man its really hardcore.				-charles **Just a quick thingie[Aleena, May  3]:**Hello...    I realize that Im a wiz commenting on this place, but...Im a newbie wiz who knows little bout coding so im actuallymore of a player....    Mizans place was just orange jello and a might smallerwhen he left originally and i have to say then thatit was EASILY my favorite place on the mud, cos it was sooriginal...well, i guess it only gets better with age, eh ??*cheers* *wishes she were a player again* Good job thisplace is ten times as fun and original as the old tub....so keep it up... and thanks...im sure if im a wiz and enjoyit... albeit a newbie wiz.... players should just love it...aleen/niki ;>**not working?[Charles, May  8]:**i dont know if its working mizan todays is 5/8/94 and i cant go anywhere.

I've been looking at that... I've been unable to login as Mizanbecause of finals but it seems every time a player reconnects (fromlinkdeath) it happens... In techno-babble, it's the result of init() notbeing called by the room. I'll look into it soon, but the problem shoulddisappear because an entirely new room driver system is being loaded(with a flood of new commands)...For those of you who like building, and not playing as much, I'vedeveloped a 'builder's guild' (I'm not too sure what to call it, any ideas?)that allows you to build rooms, monsters, and items exactly like awizard's... Sort of like a MUSH if you know what I mean...P.S. You don't have to leave your present guild to join this builder's club    (And i'm not kidding- you'll be able to build your own castle almost :)Miz**Hmm[Snow, May 24]:**This is a great place- a little tough to get to a destination you are not sure of, but fun to try.. :) Keep it coming! :)O**"
