messages "pump[Mizan, Sep  4]:**the suction pump now shows countdown-time to next castle reboot**On creating multiple characters[Oscar, Sep 13]:**I have recently contacted one of the major authorities in Nirvana                                                                          regarding the creation of multiple characters.  (I don't want tomention names, because then things get messy. *grin*)  Anyway,this authority informed that the creation and use of multiplecharacters is not illegal, so long as (and this is VERY important)they are used ONE AT A TIME.  And I would like to thank you misinformedpeople out there who made me feel like I committed murder, or treason,or grand larceny, when as far as this authority is concerned creatingand using multiple characters one at a time is much like parking in ano parking zone, jaywalking, coming into a bar with a fake id...freezingsomeone in this game.  So now I guess we're even.  However, since acertain someone feels fine with freezing people from time to time, well,I upon occasion, just for the sake of atmosphere, when the moment isright, in a way that is not obvious, and without admitting anythingto anyone, I will...well, you'll see.   :)**etc.[Mizan, Sep 13]:**One at a time, yes, but keep in mind that wizzes will dest you if youlogin with Oscar[a] to give disconnected Oscar[b] piles of coins and equips.I think that is what pisses people off more than Oscar[a] and Oscar[b]both logged in at the same time.My 2 cents,but this sort of thing is very unregulated- fear bored wizzesme**not to worry[Oscar, Sep 13]:**My system is only capable of one login at a time, whether connectedor disconnected.  By the way, there is, and only will be one Oscar comingfrom this dest.**hrphm[Mizan, Sep 14]:**you just dont get it do you? just avoid using second characters in ANY formand you'll save yourself a shitload of trouble. player 'joebob' leaving aroomful of equipment for disconnected character 'oscar' is just as bad as'joebob' giving 'oscar' stuff while both are logged in at once.etc.**MIZAN!!!!![Blodkuil, Sep 14]:**I was going to upload a great BIG  **MOOOOO** now that I have gotten internet access again... but I lost the file...:)Woooooga! I'm back:)How are things here?TTYL  -Little cave girl Blodkuil**Let us clear the air[Oscar, Sep 14]:**I'm just going to use different characters.  Not at the same time, not with one disconnected and the other connected, not with both logged inat the same time.  Just some days I'll be Oscar, other days I'll be someoneelse.  That's all.  And you're right, Mizan.  I am just bitching andcomplaining, but that's what us grouches do best!!!Oscar the Grouch.**oops[Mizan, Sep 19]:**The automatic reboot process tosses you out if you are morphed, or shadowedor something... There's nothing i can do to prevent this, unless anotheruncloaked player, a kid, or a pet is present in the room with you.Sorry about the inconvenience- remember that reboot time is displayed onthe pump and the castle will only 'panic' reboot when the lag gets real thickand soupy.miz**TIAMAT[Mizan, Oct  3]:**I'd really watch out for this guy. I mean REALLY REALLY watch out forthis guy. REALLY really ReAlLy rEaLlY gee i ran out of ASCII tricks butR e a l l y  watch out for this guy.[Standard disclaimer enclosed]mizan**sdfknsdfkjn[Mizan, Oct 11]:**no, i did not delete antything.no, i am not running a crippled randomroom driver.I was just pissed at the way my castle handles memory,and the new room system is another subtle thing for youto figure outmoo**uh[Spawn, Oct 14]:**what happened to the rock to mudding 101i miss killing punksjust curious**re:spawn[Mizan, Oct 14]:**The admin here are trying to purge (with good reason) castles that haveslaughter houses in them, i.e. a room with like 10 identical monsters init waiting to be killed. I am recoding the area so it is more interesting,and less automatic than before. I have no idea when it will open.miz**borg suck![Chalupa, Oct 15]:**well mizan i dont know if you read this very oftenbut as i understood it bad things would happen at lev 15being lev 14 i got zapped by the borg..... ouchi was just wondering if the jello will go back to the way it wasi need to find squish badly.. and half an ethermuck is not cutting itplease let me know if you are going to reinstate the jellothanks Chalupa!**variable castle size situation[Mizan, Oct 15]:**Ok, there is no easy explanation for this- but here goesthis castle is the only one of its kind on the mud. It reboots itself everyhour or so, and being that it is one of the physically larger ones and drawslots of memory, it's vital that it does so.The castle relies of a new series of stats and computes it's potentialsize according to a mix of how many players are logged on, the current lagevaluation, and a constant fed into the formula.The castle used to run at full throttle all the time, nine exits per room,dozens of rooms, potential for load was always 100%. Now, if there are like25 players on, and heavy lag, the castle will not load more than about 8%of its full capacity. Get it? This is an experiment i am conducting to seehow the lag here can be reduced. My castle is most probably the one thatdraws the most resources on the entire mud. This experiment seems to beworking- if I decide to stay with this variable-vectored room driver, Iwill need a few things from you:(cont on next note)**contd.[Mizan, Oct 15]:**contd. from last note1) i need a list of the rooms you consider your favorite rooms. I will nned  to regroup the room pools so the 8% loaded in heavy lag wont be the  shitty ones.2) Try not linger in morph form (some guilds have powers) because the  automatic rebooter will not recognize you in morph form. It will toss you  into the void and you will risk losing your kids, pets, and items layingaround.shrug, i'm rambling again- more latermiz**fav places[Chalupa, Oct 17]:**well mizan places that must be!kango... gumbo... panic... squish... boofers and snorri areas galoreand that is all i really visit in the jello anywayslater and thanks**hrmps[Mizan, Oct 20]:**Hmm... the castle saves more memory running full-bore than it did withthe selective, variable-sized exit vectoring driver.... Boggle that.(mysteries, mysteries...)miz**"
