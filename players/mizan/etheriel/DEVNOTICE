>> DEVELOPMENT NOTICE

 My guild has just been opened. The castle will undergo a massive
upgrade but it is for the most part transparent to the players.
Room drivers and all of the item files will be reformatted to
an object-file based existence to cut castle memory usage by
a few hundred percent.

The following is just a description of the different morph forms in
the guild:


Current Polymorph selections:
WOMBAT         A harmless looking but underestimated explorer.
GOLEM          A strong, silent, skullbashing type.
TREE           A provider of healing and nourishment.
FUNGOID        A master of darkness and the fungal elements.
SPONGE         A heat-sink for team combat.
BLOBEL         An adept of dimensional manipulation.
REPLICANT      A stronger, faster, improved human thing.
PUFFBALL       A being of pure energy, and powerful offense.
SHOUTBOX       A wide range spellcaster.
TETRAPOD       A fearsome, multilimbed, super-tough beast.
BOGGLEMANCER   A powerful (and confusing) magelike thing.
