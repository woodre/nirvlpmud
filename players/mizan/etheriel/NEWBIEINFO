>>-------------------<< New Player Info >>-------------------<<

I don't want to spoil too much of the fun in exploring around,
but I think you should know a few of the monsters you can kill
at your level. The following are good monsters for totally fresh
players, equipped with the stuff from the newbie dispenser (south
of the church):

Beano          In most cases, the larger the beastie, the
Spuckball      tougher it may be... In MOST cases... look at
Punks          the monster first, etc.

I think that knowing those three monster groups are good enough
for the new player. There is no set rule to pick out which monster
is harder, so you need to go by the monster's describes, and trial
and error. Checkstops are installed to keep you from getting wasted
by a high-level monster.

P.S. It would be a good idea to buy a couple of panic buttons from the
      fridge (if it is here) before you wander around.
(help jello) will give you a screen full of the extended commands in
this place...
