>> Welcome to the guild!

We are a new guild, rather small to start with in the beginning,
but its easily expandable and I want to know what you think.
If you're totally clueless, type 'info' for a list of guild
abilities and try out everything that isnt an offensive spell.
There will be messages posted on the newsgroups as well,
give 'info news' to see how to use the guild news reader.

Thanks for joining, and i want to know whats on your mind
about this guild, since it's somewhat differently structured
than most others.

p.s. I dont know what to put in this room yet to decorate...
    Perhaps a catapult to shoot things around the mud with,
    or a vending machine, i'm still thinking. Let me know what appeals
   to you as well.
