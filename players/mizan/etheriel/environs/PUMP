  This is a beat-up, rusty old gas pump. It is not connected to anywhere
  it seems, but it dispenses something nonetheless. Upon closer
  inspection, you see the following:

      Happy Moe's Berynol Pump!

    To use, give the command 'pump <x>' where x is how much
  Berynol units you want in your plastic blue tank.
  Current price (OPEC exclusive): 7 gold coins per unit.
