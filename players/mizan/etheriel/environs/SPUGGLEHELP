The game of Spuggle is very easy to learn and is based almost
entirely on chance. Spuggle works very much like a slot machine.
There are several sets of icons, represented here in their value forms:

            Icon        Value
          [spoogle]       5 coins
          [pachung]      10 coins
          [benga]        50 coins 
          [Moggle]      100 coins
          [Squish]      500 coins
          [SPUGGLE]    1000 coins 

You recieve three icons per game. If the first two icons match, you win!
Your winnings are reflected as above. 

The third icon displays a number. That number is the Zoofle, or your
prize multiplier. Whatever is in that slot gets multiplied to your winnings.
The number ranges from zero to four. Zero has the _greatest_ chance of
appearing. Supposing you win and recieve a zoofle of zero, the money you
would have won goes back into the pot. The next player to win anything
gets their winnings plus whatever is in the pot.

Simple, is'nt it? Why not give it a shot? Only 25 coins per game.
