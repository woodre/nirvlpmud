	This is a spigot for filling green thermos bottles. It can only be used
  for the thermos. Currently, there is only one grade of ooze available,
  for the intox version, which costs 15 gold per point. Each point heals
  one hp/sp. 

	To use, type 'pour X' where X is the amount of units you want to
  fill the thermos.
