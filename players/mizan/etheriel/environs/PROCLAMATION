[2] Easier said than done... Pulsar's gonna be holed up for a few weeks
    recovering from his wounds. Anyone got a steady supply of Berynol?

[3] Twenty Boofers tried attacking him. No survivors. Any ideas, guys?

[4] I can't take him alone, even full strength with my brother I
    don't think we can do it...

[5] Summerhead picked a damn bad time to go on a #@!&ing crusade against
    some psycho mad wizzes! Foolish dragon... And where is Etheriel?
    When is she coming back? Is she coming back? *nervous whine*

[7] I hope this cheers you up... I caught Tiamat opening an extra-dim
    portal... I zokked him with as much matter as I could, and I think
    it worked, but it's only temporary... He's somewhat trapped in this
    obelisk I made, but someone has to loosen it up and finish him off.
    Any takers?

[8] Uh... guys... The obelisk is cracking... I think one good, hard smack
    from something big is enough to break it... *cry*

[9] He cant hurt you if you're in the church! *garble* -
