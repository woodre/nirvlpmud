	This is a faucet for filling jugs of healing. It can only be used for
  jugs of healing. Currently, there is only one grade of ooze available,
  the non-intox version, which costs 60 gold per point. Each point heals
  one hp/sp. 

	To use, type 'fill X' where X is the amount of units you want to
  fill the jug.
