	>>---------<< /players/mizan/etheriel/ROOMS >>---------<<

	All of the rooms that run under the RandomRoom.c and
	RandomRoomDM.c room drivers reside in this directory.

	Rooms that do not run under at least RandomRoom version 2.6
	reside in /players/mizan/etheriel/rooms (lowercase)

	All rooms currently run on the 2.6 standard, and I see little
	possibility in even introducing RandomRoom 3.0 because it
	seems that 108 rooms is the limit for most people to stand.

	Basically, /players/mizan/etheriel/rooms will see little use,
	if any, since I plan on making all of the rooms in the
	castle unique. Rooms will either be using RandomRoom.c (2.6+),
	a custom setup, or the upcoming LiquidRoom.c which will
	receive the directory /players/mizan/etheriel/liquid.
