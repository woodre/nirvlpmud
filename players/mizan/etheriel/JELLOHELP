>>--------------------- Welcome to Etheriel ----------------------<<

    There are some functions added in to this area that make it very
different from anywhere else on the mud...

'bleat' is a special channel available only to those who are currently
  in the Plane of Etheriel. It behaves very much like 'gossip' and
  'shout' channels, etc.

bleat <msg>	Tell something to everyone who is currently in the area.
bleat :<msg>	Emotes over the channel.
bleat list	Displays who is currently in the castle.

jumpto <plyr>	Teleports you to <plyr> player, provided he/she/it is
		is currently in the realm.

wormhole <dest>	Allows you to build a tunnel to <dest> destination.
		Experiment with it to figure out what is going on...

help jello	This screen.

** HINT: It would be advisable for new travellers to buy some panic buttons
   from the refridgerator (If it is still alive at the 'entrance'.

Any questions, comments, etc. please mail Mizan.
