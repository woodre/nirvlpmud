This is a VERY different kind of castle... you will discover that
movement takes on a whole new meaning here. The concept behind this
castle is that new players can wander around freely in the same
area as high-level players.

HINTS:

1) Items that sound harmless tend not to be! (Same with monsters!)
2) Buy some panic buttons to make escaping this real much easier.
3) Look at and study monsters before attempting to kill them.

** Type 'help jello' for a list of extended commands within the castle **
