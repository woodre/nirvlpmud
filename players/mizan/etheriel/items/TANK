This is a large blue plastic tank to store Berynol in. You are not
too sure exactly what Berynol is but that is not
the point. It's a strong alcoholish stuff that heals
so it must be good.

Commands:
 tank X : where X is the amount of units that you want to heal.
	  Each unit heals one hitpoint and one spellpoint.

 tank	: shows how many charges are remaining in the thermos.

  bs	: automatic heal (Using Spellpoints as a marker)

  bh	: automatic heal (Using Hitpoints as a marker)

 Automatic heals work like this: Assuming you use hitpoints as a marker,
the tank does the following: heal=(max hp - current hp). If you had more
spellpoints at the time, you should have chosen spellpoint autoheal as
not to waste any tank units. This proves to be very helpful in quick combat.
