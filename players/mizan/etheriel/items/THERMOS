This is a healing thermos. Congrats on your purchase of it!
It can be a very useful tool when used properly.
Commands:
  the X : where X is the amount of units that you want to heal.
	  Each unit heals one hitpoint and one spellpoint.

  the	: shows how many charges are remaining in the thermos.

  ts	: automatic heal (Using Spellpoints as a marker)

  th	: automatic heal (Using Hitpoints as a marker)

 Automatic heals work like this: Assuming you use hitpoints as a marker,
the thermos does the following: heal=(max hp - current hp). If you had more
spellpoints at the time, you should have chosen spellpoint autoheal as
not to waste any jug units. This proves to be very helpful in quick combat.
