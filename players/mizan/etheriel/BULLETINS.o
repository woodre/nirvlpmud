messages "CLUB MEETING IN AREA TROTSKI[Guessed, Nov 14]:**  Clemency of Tides allowing, this cycle's meeting willbe held with smells included. The speaker-of-note will bethis really effing unGodly big spider because it wants toand we were scared to tell it 'no.' Tom Christiansen,vocal advocate of the Perl programming language, will bemocked during the aperitifs and burned in effigy.  See you there!**Sensation/Poetry Slam Next Tide![Oolabob, May 22]:**  Hey hey, it's that time again! While the Nirvaniteturn-out at the last (next?) S/P Slam was franklyunderwhelming, the Sapient Treekind had _several_ strongsubmissions, with Yerkle's "Brandy Alexander Heart"taking the grand prize of a glass of lime Kool-Aid in anorange anodized aluminum tumbler.  This Tide's theme is riffs & variations on the themeof standing hip-deep in warm minced clams, so go get toit, and we'll see you there!Oo!**Fear the Energizer Bunny![Dent, Aug 20]:**Really!*lick*Dent**healing jug[Fajera, Oct 13]:**lower the prices for charges! its waaay too high... that would be 3k for a 50/50 heal with only one sip!**Discovery II[Sleepwalker, Apr 18]:**So I am doing my usual stroll through the jello right?Sho'nuff I run into a happy hungry sarawak who immediatelyingests me to its contentment. Now, I had just spent awhile earning the tons of loot I had on me and in doingthe Symbiote transformation so I was in no mood to leave the mud out the wrong end of a Sarawak. So imaginemy incredible glee when I figured out the way to inducethe little rascal to 'emit' me. Yes folks, there is away to escape the digestive system of a Sarawak. To figure it out, I suggest focused effort and concentration.Given how long it took me to figure this out I thinkone should be given quest points, but that is anothermatter entirely :-)Sleepwalker**Jello Wanderers[Yorick, Apr 29]:**Heed my word, learn the jello well my friend. Pay attention to the notes on the board. There is a rhyme and reason to the jello, you just must focus and concentrate, immerse yourself into the jello, if you be a powerful adventurer I would suggest looking through the entire jello, you'll find the Keep of Etheriel and other such antiquities here. Beware the Sarawaks and tornados, pay slight attention to the Borg Cube.**hint[Sleepwalker, May  1]:**Ok cats. Now that I am having people ask me all the timefor how to escape the Sarawak I'll give you all a hint. The key is to do something _twice_. That is the hard thing to figure out. It doesn't work when you do it once, but works only when done a second time.Sleepwalkerps. and I trust that any mysteries solved by ya'll will find their way back to this board to help the public as well :-)**Hi[Mizan, Sep 23]:**I'm back.Thanks for keeping the faith.I'll be making subtle changes to the jello, mostly in the stability dept.and introducing a few new little things here and there. I'm still slowlygetting acclimated to coding LPC again though.-m***headline[Goon, May 19]:**Cant follow thorugh the jello**tug list[Springdawn, Oct 18]:**Ok I think that maybe we should be putting more stuff in tug.It would help out immensely with the new members of guild andSome of the old. I am trying to put stuff in there when I can, but ir*if everyone did, it would mean alot! This is only a suggestion though! Thanks Spring ****Guild[Upus, Nov 20]:**Have been giving it some thought.  While we are not hierarchical like Knightas and Shardak, we are still supposed to be a guild.  Other than trying to organise some poly parties, leaving stuff in tug and helping newbies, and looking for ideas on how we can expand our 'guildness'.  Upus**Forms[Springdawn, Jan 19]:**I would like to know if there is a way to tell ifor rather how many forms you have left for the day.other than trying to morph.....if there is not,I feel that ther should be some way that weshould be able to check them without morphing.always in the guild,Springdawn**tug[Upus, Jul 15]:**Not to mention any names yet, but Tug is supposed to be a guild resource, not a cheap way for high level polys to get good gear.**Guild Tug Suggestion[Crip, Dec  7]:**Why not have it to where your guild wizard can have it to where what ever equipment is pushed into tug has no coin value to it as well as it is made non-storable in lockers or any other place besides the guild hall in the tug locations.Just a suggestion.....crip**headline Wizards[Mrjones, Aug 29]:**Just a reminder to all, there are alot of problems with thingson every site, bugs, etc...One thing is for sure is our wizards work hard and quickly to help maintain and run this mud...They have been doing it longer than anyone else for this long...I think that we all (me included) need to rely on our guild masters...Iethe heads of our guilds and make some sort of asking order ie in the service we had a chann of command...What do you think...it would free up the wiz's so they can take care of major problem rather than BS like where is the green etc...Let's cut them some slack cause they have enoiught to do...sorry about the typo, but importantly you get the picture...mail me if this makes sence to anyone...MJ**"
