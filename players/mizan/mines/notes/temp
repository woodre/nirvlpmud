I know your online, but I thought I would send this msg via mudmail, so you
could read and delete at your leisure. I heard your coding or actually I
see you are talking about a new area you are making.  Thats awesome!  You
have actually inspired me to send this message!  I actually stayed up all
night and made a flowchat of idea for a new guild!  So, this would be my
humble request for wizardship. I do have programming experience in Java and
C++.  And I have been around for a long time!  You probably know me as
Achilles, Odysseus, Valen, Thadeus, Bahamut, Coercion, and Equilibrium.
The main reason why I want to become a wizard is simple!  I want to make
the Mud more fun.  I plan on doing so by making a new guild and new areas.
Plus, I actually had fun making up the theme for the guild and everything.
So, all I would need to do is learn the synaxs for coding on a Mud.
Thanks for your time and I would love to hear back!
