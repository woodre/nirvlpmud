>> ORDER: PESTER OBJECT

Usage:
order <indexnum> pester <creature> <duration>

Example:
'order 3 pester mizan 10'

Description:
This is a watered-down version of harrass. The monster will only follow
the victim around, and use casual emotes. No visibly hostile activity
will ensue, only that the monster will follow the player around
relentlessly.

This operates on name, so the monster will pester anything with the name
that matches it... in this case the first thing that appears in find_player()
and then find_living().
