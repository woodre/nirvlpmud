>> ORDER: PESTER OBJECT

Usage:
order <indexnum> pester <creature> <duration>

Example:
'order 3 pester mizan 10'

Description:
This is a watered-down version of harrass. The monster will only follow
the victim around, and use casual emotes. No visibly hostile activity
will ensue, only that the monster will follow the player around
relentlessly.
