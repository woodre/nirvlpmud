>> ORDER: KILL BY OBJECT

Usage:
order <indexnum> killobj <creature> <duration>

Example:
'order 3 killobj mizan 10'

Description:
This specifies a specific object that the monster should kill
when encountered in its travels. Not a very specific way to hunt 
someone. For that capability refer to the 'huntobj' order.
