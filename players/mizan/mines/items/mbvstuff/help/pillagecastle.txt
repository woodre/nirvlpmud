>> ORDER: PILLAGE CASTLE

Usage:
order <indexnum> pillagecastle <creator> <duration>

Example:
'order 3 pillagecastle trix 10'

Description:
You basically send the creature to a castle where it will attack 
anything matching the creator of the castle's name. It will also
leave graffiti on the ground from where it enters (which disappears
after 30 mins).

The monsters will not be hostile to players but they will be emoting
taunts all the time. Right now a small number of castles is supported
but more is being added over time.

If a castle is not supported you will see the monsters in rollcall
all in /room based areas, acting a little confused.
