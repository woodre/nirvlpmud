>> ORDER: DISMISS

Usage:
order <indexnum> dismiss

Example:
'order 3 dismiss'

Description:
This tells the monster to go home, basically. Anything the monster is 
carrying is destroyed, and the monster removes itself from the game. 

The monster is moved into its guild hall before destruct() is called,
so items won't be littered in the game space.
