>> ORDER: EXPLODE SELF AT OBJECT

Usage:
order <indexnum> explode <creaturename>

Example:
'order 3 explode mizan'

Description:
Essentially the monster turns into a suicide bomb. It will follow a player
displaying in emotes its malicious intent, and after a period of about random(8)
seconds the monster will attack the player, and detonate doing some damage to it.

Total damage inflicted is random(playerlevel) * 6.

To those who don't have a sense of humor about this: Grow the fuck up.
I find your mindless killing and violence towards monsters on this mud offensive
to my heritage :)
