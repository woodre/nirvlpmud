If you die, you will most likely not be able to access the level since
secpasses will be on your corpse form. In order to provide for the high
service standards that everyone expects of us, and to further your
visiting experience, your corpse will be picked up by our fleet of
automated Corpse-O-Matic picking machines, and their contents will be
accessible in the Mine's lobby.

An astral ticket will be given to your ghostly form. Simply hand in the
ticket and your corpse with its contents will be retrieved by the Corpse-
O-Matic picker.

Be aware that you might have to wait a little while before the Corpse-O-Matic
picker finds your corpse, and sends it on its journey to the Mine lobby.
