>> Starting and Stopping Your Engine

In order to drive, you must start the engine on the vehicle. In order to do
this, you must have the ignition key. Be aware that the ignition key is 
different from the hatch key.

To start the engine, give the command 'start engine'.
To stop it, give the command 'stop engine'.

Of course, you must be the driver in order to operate the engine.
If the vehicle does not have enough fuel the engine will not start.

The vehicle consumes fuel when idling, and of course when moving around.
