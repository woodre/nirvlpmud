This generator supports two types of room blocks:
- Plain large grid of rooms
- Maze grid of rooms


Rooms can have one of three hazards:

A booby trap, which is usually just an item which is cloned into the room
and lies in wait (pretty simple).

A tarpit hazard, which is nothing more than an annoying action capture that
causes a player to resort to hitting the direction they need to goto a few
times extra.

An aggro monster, which attacks and basically follows them around until it
is killed.
