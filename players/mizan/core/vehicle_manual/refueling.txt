>> Refueling The Vehicle

In order to refuel the vehicle, you need to have the hatch key, and the
proper fuel type. Refueling can only be done outside the vehicle.
You need to give the command 'refuel <vehiclename>'.

The battery of the vehicle might become dead at some point as well.
A suitable battery replacement is required, and to make the swap the
command 'replace <batteryname>' is needed. Note that battery changes must
be done inside the vehicle, while refueling must be done from the outside.
