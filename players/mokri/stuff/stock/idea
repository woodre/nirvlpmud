each shop has 'x' shares available (say, 100)
the shop keeps a running tally of the money it brings in.
at the end of the month, a player receives 1% (or 1/total number of shares)
of that total for each share.
the tally then resets

there will be a 'stock exchange' room.
for each shop participating, you can view the current and projected
earnings.
for example, if the shop has taken in 300,000 coins, and we are 10 days
in to a 30 day month, the 'current' earnings would be 3,000 (1% of the total)
per share, and projected would be 9,000 (it would assume the shop would continue
to earn at the same rate till months end).
in this room, players may purchase available shares.
they may also put their shares up for sale.
when buying any share, its price is the current PROJECTED price. thus, using the
above example, the price after 10 days would be 9,000 a share. if, during the next
ten days, the shop earned more than its projected 300,000 for that 10 day period,
the price would then be higher. if it learned less, the price would be less.
in this way, people can either gain or lose money by trying to guess which shops
will under/over perform. they can also purchase stocks in less well traveled areas
cheap, then try to promote those areas/shops to make their stock price go up.

Example:
  Based on last months sales, 'shop x' has projected earnings of 300,000 for the month.
  This makes the price for each share 3,000 coins.
  Player 'a' buys 10 shares for 30,000.
  Player 'a' checks in 5 days later. The shop has taken in a total of 60,000 during those 5 days.
  If we are in a 30 day month, and project this out, the shop should now earn 360,000 coins for the month.
  This means each share is now worth 3,600.
  Player 'a' decides to put five of his shares on the market.
  5 days later, the shop has taken in a total of 90,000 for the month.
  Since we are now 10 days in, the projected earnings are only 270,000.
  If that player has any shares still up for sale, player 'b' can buy them for a mere
  2,700 now!
  If player 'b' were to purchase 3 shares, 8,100 would go into the bank account of
  player 'a', and 3 shares would be transfered to player 'b'.
  The shares go up and down like this all month, based on sales, until the totals
  reset and everyone with shares is paid off.
  Once you put shares up for sale, you cannot take them off.
