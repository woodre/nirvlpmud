Upon completion of character creation, player is given
options that will determine their newbie experience.
Options:
1. I am familiar with Nirvana.
2. I have mudded before, but am new to Nirvana.
3. I have never mudded before.

If they choose #1, we drop them off at the church and let
them have at it. No change from how it currently works.

If they choose option 3, they are dropped into a room with
a 'trainer' mob of sorts (have to make it clone new rooms or
something, so people arent interrupted in their room by another
new person). The mob brings them through some MUD basics (communication,
get, inventory, look, etc.). The player can cut the tutorial off
at any time and move on to the 'Nirvana specific' step.

If option 2 is chosen, or upon completion of step 1 if they chose option
3, they are brought to the 'nirvana specific' room. This room works
as above, except it teaches about things specific to nirvana (guilds
(giving a rundown of them all), PK, kids, good areas, money, advancement,
stats, storage, etc.).

Perhaps during all of this, we can let them go through using their 'stat
points' in a more formal way (You have x points. where would you like
to spend them?) instead of having them have to go to the advancement hall
and do it.

During the tutorial, they are walked through a fight, and getting armor/weapon
off of the corpse. They get to keep this gear when they are done. Maybe even
throw a few coins in there and have them 'buy' a heal in the tutorial. They
get to keep that, too.

Once all of that is done, explain that were dropping them at the newbie hall,
and let them off there. add a command there so they can redo the tutorials
at any time, and set their logon room to there.
