Syntax: clanobj_name [name]

Sets the name of the clan object to 'name'.
This will be what you type to look at the object,
etc.

Example:
  If the short description (clan_help clan_short) were
  set to 'A big red ball', I'd want to be able to type
  'look ball' to look at it. To set it's name to 'ball'
  to be able to do this, I would simply type
  'clanobj_name ball'
