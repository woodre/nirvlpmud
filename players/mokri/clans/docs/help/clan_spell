Syntax: clan_spell

Obtain information on your clan spell.

Spell type        Either 'damage' or 'heal'
Spell name        Command you type to use the spell
Spell cost        Cost in spell points to use the spell
Spell delay       Number of seconds between castings
Damage type       Type of damage ('damage' type spells only)
Caster message    Message given to caster when the spell is cast
Target message    Message given to the target when the spell is cast
Room message      Message given to the rest of the room when the spell is cast

Note that 'delay' is clan wide. For example, if 'delay' is set to 10, then only
one member of the clan may cast the spell every 10 seconds.

The higher the cost and delay, the more effective the spell.
