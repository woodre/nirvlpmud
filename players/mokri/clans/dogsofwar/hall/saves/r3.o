long_desc "You enter into Claw's personal study, large bookshelves cover all ofthe walls of this room. A smell of dust and aged parchment permeate theair here. A simple wooden desk in one corner sits in the only space notfilled with shelves for ancient texts. What it is this man studies issomething that many people have desired to discover, however the booksare all in a long forgotten language, which it seems only he knows. Younotice a freshly penned volume on the desk, but when you go to read ityou find it is scrawled in the same foreign runes, and seems to havebeen written in blood. Perhaps it is best not to dwell in this place.[0m"
