If you see something you need, use it, but please put it back when before you logoff.  Other members may want to use it at a later time.KILLEMALLBURNEMDOWN","tembo%DATA_BREAK%1193407020%DATA_BREAK%Portal of the Fire%DATA_BREAK%I have installed a Portal in the clan just south of the main entrance.  The locations available are self-explanitory and are not changeable.  Better than nothing.  Allows for fast exits when stalking prey;)KILLEMALLBURNEMDOWN","wicket%DATA_BREAK%1194657713%DATA_BREAK%Alliance%DATA_BREAK%An alliance has been formed with the Dark Dreams clan. Crip has given his word as well as his loyalty to the shardak alliance. He said he is willing to do and help in any way that is needed.If everyone is trusting and faithful to the Dark Dreams clan as well as our own then yet we grow even more stronger!Slay em' AllWicket your brother in blood.","tembo%DATA_BREAK%1194873870%DATA_BREAK%Lockers%DATA_BREAK%In order to provide the best clan experience currently available today, our clan hall will be under construction in an effort to expand our storage capabilities.  If you have an spare coinage when you log, feel free to donate it to the private_coffer.  At my earliest convienence I will add additional lockers and or other rooms for members.  I have added another set of lockers to the east of the current lockers.  Since they put an end to the public_coffer, I think this guild should exploit what it has left to offer, lockers!  ","tembo%DATA_BREAK%1194898000%DATA_BREAK%Tembo alliance%DATA_BREAK%Tembo makes his own alliance.
