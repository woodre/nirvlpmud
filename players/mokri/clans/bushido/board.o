messages ({"jacob%DATA_BREAK%1199093130%DATA_BREAK%New lockers%DATA_BREAK%There are now 2 added locker rooms, west and east from the one you created, whichis up from the main entrance. the one west of it has some things stashed in caseyou'll ever need them. Tomarrow I'll work on rebuilding the clan coffer andlikely to be adding more items into the lockers therein. Hope all is well.Anytime you need anything or feel the need to leave me a message, just goahead and do so here, as this board is here for this reason. Take care.Jacob the Shogun - Born from the 7th Circle","jacob%DATA_BREAK%1199094241%DATA_BREAK%Clan Spell%DATA_BREAK%I wrote the clan spell.
