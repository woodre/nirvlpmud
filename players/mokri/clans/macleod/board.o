I am up for room desc if someoneis good with that.  Something that would make thehall uniform.  Also We have one locker room currentlyI would like to have about 10.  Not sure how you guys feel about it but we could make one locker roomfor each member and have a locker hall. each member would be on the honor system not to take items from someone's locker room and still have a couple community rooms.  Let me know whatyou think.                         Joab :) Clan Owner  :)","joab%DATA_BREAK%1191121085%DATA_BREAK%lockers%DATA_BREAK%Hello Everyone,I was glade to see the coinage going up in the private coffer.
