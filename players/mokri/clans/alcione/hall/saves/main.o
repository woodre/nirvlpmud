long_desc "A fairly sizable hall built from stone, the Alcione Order entrance isimpressive, but still welcoming.  There are long, narrow windows sethigh up on the walls.  Brightly-colored banners hang down between thewindows, almost to bare the flagstone floor.  Small archways lead eastand west, with a larger one to the north, while the huge entrance gatesare to the south.[0mType 'exit' to leave."
