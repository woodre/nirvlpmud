long_desc "The Alcione Order's grand hall is an impressive affair, wide enough fora number of banquet tables, and vaulted high enough for the ceiling to behidden in the shadows behind the massive chandeliers hanging there.Large open fireplaces can fill the room with additional light and heatwhen needed.  To the south is the entrance hall.  Doorways to the north,east, and west are currently bricked over.[0m"
