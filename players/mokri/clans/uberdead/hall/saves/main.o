long_desc "[1;30mThis is a tower, built solely from the dark magic bound within the[0m[1;30mpowers of Sickness, the Minister of Souls. The tower seems to extend[0m[1;30mupwards forever, and shadows flit around everything. In the center[0m[1;30mof this entryway is the Necronomicon, on a black onyx pedestal, and[0m[1;30mmany books line the shelves on the walls, all filled with words of[0m[1;30mthe darkest of magics. There is also a spiral staircase upwards,[0m[1;30mand a magically sealed trapdoor leading down.[0m[0mType 'exit' to leave."
