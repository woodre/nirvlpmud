But I figured that was pretty much cheating.\"","[Sat Jan 25 19:34:45 2014] Alexis laughs.  \"Kinda, yes.  Clever, though.\"","[Sat Jan 25 19:35:55 2014] Garald: Also, I made the command to move the entrance cost 100sp","[Sat Jan 25 19:38:37 2014] Alexis: A moment, dear.  Phone.","[Sat Jan 25 19:44:45 2014] Alexis smiles.  \"It was my mom.

About 5-10 minutes....after that, I'm here for the evening with not too many more interruptions.","[Sat Jan 25 19:48:15 2014] Alexis grins.  \"At being able to eat half a family sized lasagna.  I can usually only manage one piece....and only wish I could eat more of it!
