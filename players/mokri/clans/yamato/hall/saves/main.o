Huge bamboobeams support a towering roof-line that seems to reach to the [37mheavens[0m.Intricately woven rugs of silk muffle your footsteps, and soften the floorunder your feet.  The multi-layered walls are created of ancient bambooplanks, carefully placed in overlapping layers to protect the [1;32mYamato Clan[0mfrom attack.  The [1;31mShinto Shrine[0m, in which you stand is virtually impregnable.To the North is the mighty [1;32mYamato Castle[0m where the Samurai's [1;34mEmperor[0m resides.To the West you can see something that resembles adobes, possibly for [1;32mYamato[0m members.To the South and East is the storage area for the members.[0mType 'exit' to leave."
