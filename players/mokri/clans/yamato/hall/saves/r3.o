long_desc "You have approached a four way Intersecion.  On the ground you see the remains of horrible and poweful dragons, remains of once undefeatable Warriors.  You even see the decapitated heads of mighty and powerful Player Killers now on a long metal spike that is stuck into the ground.  Above the east archway there are words inscribed into the stone that say [1;36mSquint's [0m tunnel.  Above the west archway there are words inscribed into the stone that say [1;31m Glaxgor's [0m tunnel. To the north a very structured and rounded archway.  The inscribed words are hard to make out.  [0m"
