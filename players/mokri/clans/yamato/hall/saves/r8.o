long_desc "Soft yellow light illuminates the body of the cave,showing off the many vials and potions lining therock walls. Animal hides hang in loose folds fromhemp ropes which magically float in mid air. In theeast wall a portal of blue fire opens and closes like the lens of a camera. Only the mighty may enterthe portal of fire. Only those bathed in blood andcoated in honor. If you are mighty, you may enter.[0m"
