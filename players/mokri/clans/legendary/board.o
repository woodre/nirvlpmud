new_mess "Welcome to the clan.  The idea behind this clan is to have a brotherhood of those who have proven ourselves, and who share a level of mutual respect and affection.  We're the elite in this world.  Our public-coffer is for startup cash for big exp runs, orfor moving into the private coffers to add more locker space, makethe clan hall larger, etc.  Our lockers are communal, and things like wocket heals should be kept there, for use on those big runs,gear, so we can regear if we lose things, or for helping others, etc.  We all tend to kill the big nasties of the world, so we canadd the more elite items to our storage rather than just giving them away at random to people who usually just sell them.  In any case, the main rule is to simply have respect for each other,don't do bad things with the coffers, like always draining it butnever adding to it, taking out wockets and whatnot and replacing them with garbage or not at all, etc :)  Other than that, let's have some fun, kill some xp records, help some noobs and others, slaughter some peoples, and just generally be examples of what the'legendary' players should be.-Bleh"
