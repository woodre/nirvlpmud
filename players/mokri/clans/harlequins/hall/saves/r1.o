long_desc "  This room twinkles with multi-spectrum lights given off from countlessgem stones that comprise the walls.  A calming hum reverberates from allaround stilling thoughts and giving a serene peace to the mind.  In thecenter of the room is a shattered statue, what it once was has been allbut destroyed leaving only the base of it intact.  A feeling of intenseregret and sadness radiate outward from the ruin of the statue, and onecan't help but wonder what it means.[0m"
