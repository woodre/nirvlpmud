long_desc "This large, ornately decorated room is the main meeting hall for theHarlequin clan.  Multiple gold sconces adorn the walls, eachsupporting a softly glowing lantern, illuminating the room.  Darkcherry wood paneling covers the walls intricately carved with ornateboiseries and embellished  with shimmering gold gilding.  Severalplush sofas and chairs upholstered in lucious red velvet line the wallsseperated by dark reddish-brown mahogany pedestal tables.  Alarge wood-framed fireplace with dark granite hearth housing acrackling fire adds to the warm, cozy atmosphere.[0m"
