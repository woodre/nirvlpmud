A shroud of darknessenvelopes the room, obscuring the boundaries, making itimpossible to determine its size.  The soft light from several lanternspierce the darkness revealing large wooden tables, one for eachlantern, scattered about the room among countless columns ofdusty shelves each extending beyond the boundaries of theavailable light in both height and width.[0mType 'exit' to leave."
