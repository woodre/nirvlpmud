long_desc "This looks like an old storage room off the basement that was used to store extra booze. Old boxes, crates and kegs line the wall and shelves of the room. A newer looking desk has been added to the room as of late. It seems to be lacking the same amount of dust the other items in the room have. A giant map of Nirvana is posted on the wall, while file folders are stuck to the wall with papers sticking out of them. Above the map, in big black letters, is posted [4m"Project Mayhem"[0m.[0m"
