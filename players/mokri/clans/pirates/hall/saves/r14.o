long_desc "[1;31mYOU HAVE ENTERED ALORA'S PERSONAL ROOM, REMOVE YOUR ASS NOW!![0mAs soon as you enter this room you can tell it is inhabitated by a woman, but not just any woman. The remaining scent of her perfume is the only thing that tells you she was previously here. Everything is immaculately clean. From the ceiling to the floor everything is in it's proper place. The Jade green walls reflect off of the hardwood floor. The King size bed looks so comfortable you can hear it call your name, inviting you to rest. There is a bookshelf completely packed with books, and little nick nacks. A large wooden vanity is in the corner  with bottles of perfume and a box of makeup, in front of the vanity is a matching chair. A large antique mirror is hanging on the wall above the bed. You feel at peace here, but know that you shouldn't be here. You think to yourself: [1;33mIf Nyteshade catches me in here, I'm dead.[0m"
