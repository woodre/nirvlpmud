description "is covered with sleek black fur, underneath which ripples musclesof steel.  His razor-sharp claws click on the floor as he approaches you,and his intense green eyes hold your gaze like predator to prey.  He reachesyou, takes your measure with a single sniff, then turns away to find food.You realize you have been gazing upon the Panther Bard."
