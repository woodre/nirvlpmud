description "has silken black hair that falls loosely down her back. A small braid borders her delicate, young face. Her skin is fair, and utterlyflawless. Her silver eyes are deep-set, and seem to glow with an immortallight. She wears a long skirt, made of silver satin, that falls to herankles and brushes lightly against her bare feet when she walks. Hershirt is made of black satin, and has been left unbuttoned at the top,revealing the tender skin of her supple breasts. "
