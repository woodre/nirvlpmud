description "stands before you, strong and proud for a half-elf.  Yet his half-blood heritage isn't the first thing you notice about him for he has two large angelic wings which draw your attention.  You focus once more on his face and see something to add to the strangeness.  Bristan's eyes are now what hold your attention, white pupils, red irises and the rest black.  Continuing to look at him, he appears to be nothing more then a tall and strong elf."
