description "moves with an elegance that betrays her vampyric nature.  Her blackvelvet dress clings to the curves of her body, shifting subtly with hermovements.  The deep collar accentuates her creamy white skin, the exquisitelines of her neck, and the soft slope of her breasts.  Her soft, red hairfalls in ringlets, half way down her back.  As she notices you looking ather, a small smile plays across her full, blood-red lips.  Her eyes remindyou of two deep green emeralds.  The color and clarity of her eyes takesyour breath away, but you cannot help shivering.  Looking into those eyes,you see only darkness."
