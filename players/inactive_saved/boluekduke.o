description "stands before you a hardened man tempered by love, loss and life.  Rugged and cold, Bo has returned to the Duke Farm for good, venturing out only to reap that which he needs for survival.  Although his older boys have grown up and left home, he continues to nurture his youngest children, Caleb and Darien.  Dressed in jeans, boots and a white t-shirt, one unique feature manages to catch your eye:  a tarnished wedding ring that he has yet to remove from his finger.  In Bo's eyes, love is forever."
