description "has rougishly good looks and a disarming, winsome smile.  He has long brown hair that is braided and interwoven with strips of leather.  He wears very finely made, but ungaudy clothing.  His shirt looks to be made of a dark black silk, finely stitched but undecorated.  It is a lace up shirt, but is not laced, exposing a smooth, finely muscled chest.  Madmartigan's exposed flesh is liberally scattered with slash-shaped scars that look to be from swordfights, they are bright red as though as soon as they were made, they were cauterized.  His shirt falls loose over his left shoulder, exposing the bold red Dervish Tattoo embrazened on the back of it.  Madmartigan's black pants are baggy as well, tied at his waist and ankles so that he does not trip.  He is barefoot, and his feet are rough and calloused from miles of walking on harsh ground.  Madmartigan wears little jewelry, only a silver bracer on one arm, and a simple, but cherished, wedding band on his ring finger."
