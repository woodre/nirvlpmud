description ", You see her, standing there looking at you with lovely green eyes as her beautiful display of red hair dances with the wind. Her tall and embraceful figure catches your glimpse as she waves a sweet and graceful 'Hello' to you.You realize that she is a smart and intelligent woman, Maybe the business type. Her movements are verry quick and whistful.She smiles verry sweetly at you and swiftly walks away into another world."
