description "catches you looking at her and gives you a nasty 'wtf are you looking at?' type look. This woman stands at 5'8, has long, curly dark hair and dark, cold blue eyes. Most of the time she is usually very rude, non-helpful and has a bad attitude which doesn't take no shit or fear anyone.	Starlite has seenand been on all sides of the flag, good, bad and likes being neutral with very little reason to fight unless she needs to. Starlite is dressed up in a dark blue shirt which matches her eyes, blue cloak, black belt, tight black mini skirt, blue fingerless gloves, black stockings and black boots. As you notice the black widow symbol on her right cheeek, you take a 2nd thought about any goodness she might have left in her. 	Starlite doesn't have many friends and doesn't have any intent to gain many since she trusts very few and loves being a loner. Maybe the best thing to do is just to leave her the hell alone, you'll probably get ignored anyho She seems to show a particular liking for those who tend to gamble lots like herself, however."
