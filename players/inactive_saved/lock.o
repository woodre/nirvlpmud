description "                              The ShardakYou look up at the mighty Lock the Gatekeeper of the Underworld.His eyes swirl with the forces of chaos and darkness.His large muscles bulge from beneath his vest.His black hair flows like a stream down over his shoulders.You cannot control your primal emotions and are overcome in his presence.You cannot help but be intimidated by Lock the Gatekeeper of the Underworld."
