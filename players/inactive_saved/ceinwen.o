description "is in green. She is very tall, with her auburn hair heldback by a circlet of silver on her brow.  Her eyes are darkbrown and very cold.  In her bearing as she strides towardsyou is a deep scarcely suppressed rage..as as she draws near yousee that she is beautiful.  But this is not a beauty thatwarms one.  Rather, it cuts, like a weapon.There is no nuance of gentleness in her, no shading of care,but fair she is, as is the flight of an arrow before it kills."
