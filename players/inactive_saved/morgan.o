description "is wrapped and veiled in soft floating grey, and all that you can see of her is that she seems slender and young, and her hair is dark red.  She steps up close beside you and speaks in an urgent whisper, as if something might overhear you.And now, you really look at the woman, and really see her.  Her dark red hair is lighter and more glowing as the daylight visits it.  Her eyes are what you notice the most--so large and deep-set and haunting, a strange bluish-green, like turqoises, or like the sky seen through beech leaves in spring.  Her mouth is like a wild rose, and her face, pale and softly flushed, is like a wild rose too, its shape and form something more than merely perfect."
