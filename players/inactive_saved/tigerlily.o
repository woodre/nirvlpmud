description " stands before you, and attractive young Mage. She stands at roughly 5'5" tall, with long blonde hair that falls to below her shoulders, and blue-green eyes that twinkle impishly as she returns your gaze. Her figure is draped in a loose, dark-colored cloak that is tied at the waist with a thin leather cord.  She gives you a warm smile, and seems to be quite friendly and approachable.   On her left hand she proudly wears a gold wedding band, a symbol of a bonding she has with Merlyn, the Lord "
