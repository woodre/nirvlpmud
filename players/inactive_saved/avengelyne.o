description "remembers her father, the one true God, first saying to her, "Take this sword of fire, and strike with righteous judgement, you are of my warhost now, my lightning dressed as snow."  Fighting along side Michael himself she became one of the most feared Warhosts among the Dragon's legions. Even though she achieved greatness God cast her out of heaven, for the sin of questioning his word.  She found herself as a mortal and stripped of her angelic powers, however she did soon find that she retained her strength of ten times that of a normal mortal. She also realized that her father was still with her.  With this power and knowledge she continues to fight the evils of the world, determined to leave it better off than she found it.  In this her mortal form she wears black calf high lace up boots, long fingerless black velvet gloves, and what seems to be close to a black velvet bikini.  She wears little clothes as not to restrict her movements in battle, trying to find the freedom she had as an angel. She is never found without a sword in her hand and a cross around her neck.  Avengelyne is truely a breathtaking beauty to look at as her auburn hair tumbles down around her back, and her bright green eyes almost peirce your soul with righteousness."
