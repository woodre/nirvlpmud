description "   Before you she stands.  Her long curly dark brown hair is tousled around her face.  Big green eyes stare out at the world with no more of the innocence she knew when she was young.  Harder now, she has seen too much with those eyes.Disillusioned at the loss of her beloved paladins, she has shed her sense of duty to the meek and the innocent.  Distrust and anger can be seen in her face, yet she holds her head high.Having loved and lost, she holds her heart close to her.  Her loyalty to her friends is fierce, making her a formidable ally -- or a dangerous enemy."
