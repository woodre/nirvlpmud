description "When you look at me, I get an eery feeling over me.  Are you gonna try your luck at killing me?You see my devious look. My shaved head and goutee, two earings in my left ear, and my eyes are covered by my Oakley M-frames, mirrored lenses of course.  Why would I hide my eyes? When my eyes are seen my victims reel in pain and terror. My eyes flame a honey color and are quite deadly.I am the Angel of Death, the dissident, the murderer of many. I can be your best friend or your worst fucking nightmare....which do you wish to have?Good luck, cause my rage is fierce and my vengence is lethal."
