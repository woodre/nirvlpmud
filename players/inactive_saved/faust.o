description "is a tall, lean man with delicate features and arresting eyes.  His eyes are pale grey, flecked with silver, and in the moonlight they flash like diamonds.  As the weight of those eyes bear down upon you, you cannot help but to advert your stare.  A cold amusement lurks beneath a cool demeanor--perhaps a warning.  His clothes are out-of-date, but made of the finest materials.  Faust carries himself with a refined grace, a symbol of his confidence and ability.  Faust has traveled places and seen things not meant for mortal eyes.  This man is not natural or of this world...some things are best left alone...."
