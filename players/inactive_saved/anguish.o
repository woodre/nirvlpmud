description "exudes an aura of hatred and death.A dark robe covers this figure of darkness. Glowing red eyes pierce your soulfrom under his heavy hood. Darkness enshrouds him as if covered in a cloudof midnight. Hissing words that sound chaotic,  he raises his spiked glovedhands in the air and they erupt in flame. A flaming sword and daggerappear in his hands and he looks your way.Anguish hisses loudly, "Death to the enemys of Shardak and all those that oppose our Lord!!""
