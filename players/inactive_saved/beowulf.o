description "is a tall, slender young man who moves around with a blade master's grace.  Golden hair falls down past his neck to frame an almost elven chiseled face.  Deep set, forest green eyes look around with the serenity of one at peace with himself.  He wears a cloak of dark green on the outside and crimson red on the inside which conceals most of his battle wear.  Underneath are a black silk shirt inlaid with gold buttons, a red sash drapes diagonally across his chest, and black loose fitting pants with a belt.  On the belt is a golden buckle engraved with the head of a wolf.  Somewhere under the billowing cloak is a sheath which holds his trusty sword."
