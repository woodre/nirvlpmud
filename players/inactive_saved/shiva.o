description "stands before you, and smiles.  He has wavy, orange hairthat shoots out in all directions.  His eyes are a deep emerald greenthat contrasts nicely with his long underwear.  You notice that hislong underwear has many pockets in it, all colors of the rainbow and some you didn't know existed.  On his chest is a circle with 8arrows shooting out from the center, dividing the circle into 8 parts.On his left arm he wears a black armband that he wears in honor of a killed comrade with the initials W.F. sewn into it.  The lastthing you notice are his shoes...elfin-jester shoes with bellson the toes that jingle with every step.  "
