description "A tall figure stands before you, wreathed in a large dark cloak. Around the edges and collar of the cloak a deep red trim holds back the inky blackness. A large pendant hangs on a golden chair from around his neck. Gazing closer at this pendant you see a figure encased inside...a demon...Beware of him who traffics with demons...for he will have your soul....Akumalore holds a book and pen and looks ready to inscribe your tale upon his books."
