description "has green eyes that gleam in a manner not unlike a glow-in-the-dark bouncy-ball.  Her wild curls are dyed a vibrant purple! It goes with her impish  smile so well that you catch yourself wondering if it's her natural hair  color. She wears a punky outfit made of email SPAM that is safety-pinned  together.  Ask her to heal  you, ask her to tell your fortune, but please  don't ask her to marry you. "
