description "The first thing you notice are the eyes, bright shining emeralds laughingas if at some unseen joke. They are framed by a somewhat pale face and a mane of somewhat tangled, wavy golden-brown hair which spills onto his shouldersA black silken cloak wraps itself around Iuz's tall slender figure andshows only brief glimpses of the silver medallion around his neck.Tall and slender, Iuz has a mischeivious look about him, as if he just got away with something, and nooneelse knows about it... Yet. He pauses a moment before licking his lips to wipe off a smudge of redfrom his lips... Fangs?! As you look back just to make sure, he's disappeared... But you get the eerie feeling that he'll be back..."
