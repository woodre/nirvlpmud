description "is small and quick.She is wearing a long black dress, several talisman of protection and black army boots!  One of her pendants catches your eye but the symbol on it shifts and changes as if to hide its meaning.  Desmodus is Gypsy kin.  Perhaps if you ask her, she will tell your fortune!  Her fiery red hair is braided for combat and reaches past her waist.  Her impish smile betrays a wicked sense of humor!  "
