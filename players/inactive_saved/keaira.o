description "is seen with hues of grey that represent large storm clouds in the dark horizon, they glow with a tinge of illuminant speckle. Thick ebony raven curls bounce with utter rebellion as the velvet locks land against the small of her back. They are usually seen in a rebellious nature as she prefers to keep them long and flowing. She wears an ebony spider silk robe ensemble, that flows freely against her shapely figure. The mystery of ancient rebirth held within her vibrant aura of darkness that seems to fall in her wake.  "
