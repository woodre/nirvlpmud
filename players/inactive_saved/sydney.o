description "stands 5'6" with long blonde curly hair that twists downher silky back.  She has deep blue eyes that tortures your soul.While gazing into her glistening, deep blue eyes a glaze coversthem, as if something or someone is trying to burst through hersoul and merge to the outside world.  In a jealous rage, Sydney'spsyche breaks through the boundaries of her soul.  Twisting, scratching, gouging its way into the world ripping all that isevil and innocent into shreds.  Once her psyche has reached itsfull strength nothing in the realm will be safe."
