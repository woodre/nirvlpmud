description "is a young girl, her small, supple form is clothed in pants and a tunic that is wrapped loosely in a braided short cloak of forest green. Underneath this cloak she wears is a brace of wicked looking long knives strapped to her slim waist. Long, curling ringlets of thick, dark hair hang down about her shoulders, softly shadowing a sun-browned faintly freckled pixie face that is strangely beguiling, almost compelling in its look of innocence. It is a pretty face, and while not truly beautiful, it is appealing nevertheless with its uncomplicated freshness and vitality. Dark, intelligent eyes mirror frankness and honesty as she studies you curiously."
