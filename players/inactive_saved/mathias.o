description "'s muscular body gleams in the midday sunlight.Sweat drips off his bald head down his rippling muscles.His dark yellowish skin is marred with many battle scars, describing his maddness in battle.Mathias grins garishly at you.He notices you staring at the tribal tattoo running from his bald head down the left side of his face.Raising his Ketsueki Seirei, mocking you, he laughs as he heads your way."
