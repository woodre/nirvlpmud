description "looks at you with mysterious emerald eyes, while her auburnhair gently flows down her back.  You notice she has small tufted ears,long whiskers, and a beautiful, bushy tail.  Sarsha is known as the KittyBard and loves to playfully pounce her friends.  She wears an elegantlyadorned cloak that accentuates her lithe figure as it softly blows inthe wind.  A well polished walnut case is strapped to her back.  This iswhere she keeps her silver Lyre when she is not strumming a tune.  When you look deep within her eyes you see friendship and trust.  These mean the worldto her, and once you gain hers it will never be lost."
