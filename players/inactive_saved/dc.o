description "quotesIf you are LIVING IN THE WORLD TODAY, remember to read the LABELS when entering the COLD WORLD	 of KILLAH HILLS 10304.  INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS state that the DUEL OF THE IRON MIC took place in the 4TH CHAMBER.And it was the infamous SHADOWBOIN' technique that lured MC's into the razor sharp blades of solid COLD, LIQUID SWORDS.  Feel the wrath of the HELL'S WIND STAFF and learn the BASIC INSTRUCTION BEFORE LEAVING EARTH* is to explain the UNEXPLAINED	.And to those who scream keep it real and Yo God, I GOTCHA BACK, kill the fraudulent and honor the code of the lyrical SWORDSMAN.GZA WU-TANG MANUAL 4:12"
