description "Why, why repine, my pensive friend, at pleasures slipped away?Some the stern fates will never lend, and all refuse to stay.I see the rainbow in the sky, the dew upon the grass;and I ask not why they glimmer as they pass.With folded arms I linger not to call them back; t'were in vain;In this, or some other spot I know they'll shine again."
