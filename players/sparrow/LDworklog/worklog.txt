  added check for driver version, if nirvana define varible
  if not, do not define variable. I did this because I was getting
  strange results on the old lib with just removing it. 
  
  If problems arise, a copy of the old version is located at:
  /players/maledicta/cont/rooms_bk
  just copy the entire directory to:
  /players/maledicta/cont/rooms
  to roll back to old version
