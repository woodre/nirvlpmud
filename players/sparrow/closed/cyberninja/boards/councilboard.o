messages "Officer ranks(hugh):**This is a listing for Cybers about the maximun number of people per position.Sensei = unlimitedIntellect = 3Mentat = unlimited at the whim of the guild wizards.Enforcer = 3Directive = 3Executor = One per Directive.The directive is a position based on the needs of the guild.  Small numbers and few problems require one Directive.  2 Directives when diversity is needed or the single Directive can't keep up with the workload.**OFFICERS(kid):**Anything you would like to discuss or any issues you have may be put on this board.Only officers may read this board now.  Anything on this board should not be discussedwith other ninja as this is for officer discussion.  If it was to be open it would beon the main board.Kid**Intellects and Enforcers(kid):**Miso and myself have decided that Intellects should be helping to teach more to youngerninja.  Teaching them how to fight, guild rules, guild functions and helping themfollow the way.  Intellects need to work on the lore also as that was another reasonwe have opened the position.  Intellects are teachers and intellectual of the guildabilities and operation.Enforcers, you should also be teaching ninja how to fight and especially pk.  You arethe main pkers of the guild and see alot of action.  Helping teach ninja pk can makeus stronger and can help make your job easier in the future.All officers should help teach ninja, enforcer rules, and award someone for a welldone job and helping ninja.  We have a honor system, lets us it correctly, teach ninja,and make our guild number 1 on Nirvana.Kid**Repeated offenses(pike):**Concerning Kia and any other member that doesnt listen very well......Every ninja should be given one chance...some rules they might not know...in which case dishonor should be dealt...But for the repeat offenders....Ninjas who know the rules...but doesnt adhere to them as law...should be executed...and not allowed to join our guild ever againBeing an Enforcer of CyberNetica I take serious offense to the worthless Ninjas that do nothing but hold us back...therefore i strongly promote the idea of executions.This is a good way to strengthen our guild,,,by cutting off the excess fat**Gatm uses(pike):**I would like to hear some ideas from my fellow officers about what to do with our surplus of gatm credits.Surely there must be a way we can use them to our advantageI would appreciate any and all input on this topic.-Pike-**renegade(martha):**just to be clear...we are not allowing people to 'unrenegade' correct?  i am just wondering...otherwise what is the point...ifwe keep allowing those who go renegade to keep coming back?i know we allowed it the one time...but all those who arerenegade now were here back then and knew the rulejust my 2 centsmartha**Renegade(miso):**Pesty helped me and gave us a tool to track who left and why they left so if they went ren for a good reasonit will be noted and maby let back but if a bad reason all the directives will see it**Recruitment objectives(hugh):**Miso made me an intellect for the purposes of recruiting so i've written up acouple things reguarding recruitment.  Read, pick apart, discuss, then decide what you want and you don't want plus whatever you want added.Fine line for recruitment.....That one hour waiting period...perhaps code that in so from the time the Way has been shown that there is an actual manditory hour long wait.Or remove it all together.Oaths and their posting.The actual oath posted on the oath board.The reason for joining.  Not their lifestory.Their recruiter or sensei.Once these 3 things have been done.  the recruit may then post anything else, lifestory, additional adlibbed oath, other roleplay infos.The recruiter paying the 100k gatm "recruitment gift/fee" ~I'm tired of paying the recruits way.  You wana recruit you pay.  Might make recruiters a bit more serious in the recruit anyone they want kinda way.  Plus what makes a good recruiter good?  the time they spend on each recruit?  their knowledge of the ways?Hugh the Hand**Recruitment(hugh):**Since i'm not fully aware of all the rules reguarding who can and can't recruit fill me in.  Obviously pike can still recruit. Is it all officers? HughPS...anything else i'm not aware of?**recruiting(puppy):**Sensei's and above can recruit now.  If/when I ever get around the the fax files it will state that all sensei's are directly under the intellects.  There is a new command 'cyber testing.'  Look it over if you would and see if anything needs to be added/changed/taken out/whatever.  Thankx.Pup**Guild Matters (enforcers view)(pike):**I to have noticed that there are less ninjas around, but all is not lost;)  There are not as many weak ninjas to stir things up anymore.  Personally i prefer having our guild ranks being filled by successful ninjas, rather than having it overrun.  As an Enforcer I tend to feel a little obsolete.  I cannot remember the last time another guild invaded our hall.  Pike the Enforcer**Guild invasions(doodle):**Apparently it's a regular occurance...or so the notes on the main board would have me believe.Of course few would be silly enough to raid when a +100 enforcer is sitting around ;)Most of the pussies around here will only raid when "easy targets" such as fawn or demonic are on anyhow.BTW...Gratz on +100 Pike!  Excellent work!Laters,Doodle**Reasons(hugh):**Is it just me or wtf does a recruit really know about theCyberninja Way?  Recruit_01  ok here's my post...CORRECT OATH!!! (yay points there)Props to my mang hugh.  He's my numberone cyber mofo 4lifeHe's my sensei.To be the best Cyberninja ever.  Werd.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Sensei's smack your retarded recruits when they post aoath like that.  Perhaps we should check into these oaths and see if theyreally keep up to them.  Something like the newest recruit's reason: "I joined Cyberninjas to kill who oppose the Cyberninja Way."I take that as pk.  How else you gona kill those that oppose us?So if that was my oath...Surely I'm not killing ppl or have pk setor protecting our interests.  Maybe I should have to leave the guild,be dishonored, repost my oath and have a puppy or miz reset my guildstatus so that i truely can follow my oath.Reset could be just belts or just chips or everything or any combinationviewed fit.Hardass view, naw just Hugh.**Unseen(doodle):**Who sensei'd him?A: The oath is wrongB: there's nothing in view_task about a task being assigned.I would love some answers here.  Thanks.D**shardak alliance(doodle):**As I posted on the main board, you as officers are now instructed to issue 1 large dishonoring EACH to any ninja who chooses to remain an ally of shardak.i.e.  Ninjaboy chooses to remain a Shardak ally.I dishonor Ninjaboy LARGE.Tenchu dishonors Ninjaboy LARGESymbio dishonors Ninjaboy LargePike dishonors Ninjaboy LARGEetc..Honorably yours,Doodle**Renegades(doodle):**Achilles and Hadus have chosen to go renegade - for reasons that are currently unknown to me.I'm trying to be diplomatic with them and see what their intentions are concerning other pk guilds.I told them I'd gladly fight by their sides vs. Shardaks, Knights, Rangers, etc...If no opposing guilds are on, I will assume open season for both parties.I am asking that the honorables refrain from attacking the renegades if they are engaged in combat with one of the above mentioned opposing guilds.  Feel free to assist them, however.If they choose to attack an honorable while s/he is engaged with an opposing guild, then I guess all bets are off.  Does this request sound fair?  Please let me know your feelings on this matter.Honorable yours,Doodle**Shardak Alliance(symbio):**I went ahead and allied with the Shards for the time being.  I did this for two reasons:I went ahead and allied with the Shards for the time being.  I did this for two reasons:1.) They are badass.2.) They outnumber us.We need to put them in their place rather than the other way around.  I think we need the few Shardak that log on to do that.If you disagree, let it be known and we can end this.  There was just no other officers on so I had to make the decision.-Symb**Re: Shardak Alliance(kyllur):**I personally don't believe in allying with the Shardaks. If they are on and attacking a real enemy guild, I would gladly give them a hand. But, if there's no opposing guilds on, they should be open season. As we all know, they are lowly and lack any real honor or morals. This is just my thoughts. I'd like more opinions though if anyone has a thought.~fThanks,Kyllur, Executor**write(doodle):**You all know where I stand on this issue.Since Symbio is a Directive as well, he can choose what is best for his officers and him.I'll have to check to see if my original post is still on the main board - Kyllur has it in a nutshell here though.Honorably yours,D**pk(achilles):**I'm broke when I log on most of the times.  But I will hit them hard and fast!  Just enough to send them running.  With the sym or the neos symbos there should be more to kill!**"
