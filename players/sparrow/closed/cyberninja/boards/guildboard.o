messages "Honor and Harrassment (sp?)(doodle):**I'm about to tread upon what may be a touchy subject, so please bear with me and don't get offended.We are an "evil" guild, yet we are also to exhibit "honor".  This is a fine balancing act, and I'd like to establish a guide-line or two, to help differentiate between being "evil with honor" and simply harrassing people and diminishing their enjoyment of the game.We are primarily geared for pk.  PK stands for Player-killing (I know..duh!).  My interpretation of this is: if I see a player with pk set, or in a pk zone, I'll attack them and try my damnedest to kill them using whatever resources I have at my disposal.  Some of the more common means are: Calling a fellow ninja in to assist, catch them off guard while killing an NPC, or whatever.  Some consider aspects of these cheap and dirty, but to each his/her own.  This leads me into the opposite end of the spectrum, where we tread on borderline harrassment.  Trying to get a player killed, just for the sake of it.  Some examples to clarify what I mean: using firecrackers to wimpy a non-pk player in a non-pk area into a non-teleport room full of aggros to get them killed.  Another may be handing vampires torches and other light sources.  These actions serve no real purpose since the cyberninja isn't actually involved in fighting and trying to kill these players.  If someone wanted to push the issue, it could probably be considered harrassment, and punishments could be levied.  I don't want to see anyone get into trouble here.  Let me show it in a different light as well, just to push the "what's in it for me" angle.  A lvl 17 player who's minding his own business, gets firecrackered into aggro mobs and dies.  Now said lvl 17 players is lvl 15 or whatever, and even worth less in kill points.  Let them kill and grow, and they'll become better players, more challenging opponents, and worth more points if that's how you wish to look at it.I realize some people aren't about the points and such.  This is fine and well, but I am still asking all of you not to employ the above mentioned tactics.  If a person pisses you off by flapping or being a general nuisance, then I'd say they deserve whatever happens, but if they're minding their own business and just trying to grow and enjoy the game, please allow them to.  I think it'll benefit us all in the long run.  I'm trying to help elevate the Cyberninja to the revered position within Nirvana it once had.  We were both feared, and respected.  Getting people killed just for the sake of seeing them on the obits does nothing to help our cause.So in closing:  If a player sets pk or enters a pk area, by all means, raise hell with them.  Do whatever you can to bring about their demise.  BUT, if a player isn't in a pk area, doesn't have pk set, and has done nothing to piss you off, please leave them alone until one of the above criteria exist (pk/area).  Now, I don't want to be an asshole about this.  I'm posting it here on our board first, and I'm hoping that's enough to get the message across.  If I still see it happening, or hear of it, I'll make it Law.  If I have to take that step, any subsequent occurances will result in dishonorings by me and/or my officers.  I don't want to go down that path.  Any questions and/or comments, as always, feel free to see me.Honorably yours,D**titles(doodle):**Greetings,All non-max ninjas:  Please use the ninja titles (set_title #) until you aremaxed in chips and belts.  I'm asking this as a small token of respect for our guild.Thanks,D**guild credits and crystalized adrenaline(earwax):**If you don't have the cash on you, it will check your credit balanceand take from there if you have sufficient credits.-Earwax**Adrenaline(doodle):**Just an FYI for those that do not know...The Earwaxian Products Dispenser is located in Earwax's area:From Green: 6w,10n,open gate,say qtip,3n I think...It's close anyhow.Please stop pestering Earwax about this.Thanks.D**Sleepwalker and GATM(kyllur):**On Friday, December 15th shows Sleepwalker withdrawing 764383 credits total,through two withdrawals of 200k each and one of 364383.

Restassured that no wrong doing was undertaken. For moreinformation contact Earwax. theSLEEP**abilities(mokri):**New abilities are forthcoming. Keep an eye on the help files!Three have been added already. For information, read:cyber mwhocyber heat_wepcyber plant_mineThese commands are listed in cyber cmds3 and cyber cmds+-Mokri**NEWS: Guild Hierarch Changes(symbio):**NEWS: Guild hierarchy changesDue to the low numbers of active members, the CyberNinja Guild Hierarchy haschanged slightly.  The changes are as follows:Sensei: * In order to become a Sensei you must PK another player thatis either your level or higher SOLO.  Upon doing this, you must provide theExecutor with proof of the kill.  If the Executor deems the kill legit then he/shewill grant you Sensei status.Once you're a Sensei...* You must be PK at all times.  We are a PK guild.  From now on, our Sensei's will be PK at all times; always ready for a fight!Enforcer:* Enforcers are glorified Sensei.  They are Sensei's that have proven themselves in PK,thus, given the title Enforcer.  Enforcers don't hold "power" over Sensei anymore, asthey are equal in power.  However, Enforcers should be shown respect for their achievements.To become an Enforcer you must...* Have at least 15 PK's, 5 of which must be solo.Intellect:* Until further notice, this position is gone.  The Directive / Executor will assume theIntellect's duties.That is all for now, if you feel you have earned one of these positions and you've beenoverlooked, mail me or the Executor (who is yet to be named).-Symbio**flux(vertebraker):**You can now flux in PK anywhere in the mud.**fluxes(vertebraker):**Fluxes now do different damage types based on thetype, as was originally intended.**stun(vertebraker):**stun works in the guild hall now.**Adrenaline(symbio):**Adrenaline is now 30k.  Verte is working on even possibly making it an enhancement for high-level CyberNinjas.  Make sure you thank him for the help.-Symbio**For the honor of the PK.(hugh):**Inorder to help offset the huge advantage the sammi's have towards PK...It was talked about using alternate weapons.  Yes you'll get automatically dishonored for weilding said weapons.  Keep a record of these dishonorings and we'll get you back up to snuff.BUT ONLY FOR PKING PURPOSES.  If you are seen with one equip'ed and are not currently engaged in pk.  You can keep the dishonor.Recap.  Use your guild weapon for everything unless you feel the need to use some special weapon like the armor breaking weapon Zan(something or other).I also suggest you do this when another cyberninja is on.  Otherwise you'll need to wait for a guardian to review the honor logs.If I missed anything Symbio can remove this note and add/change however he sees fit.Hugh**Zantetsuken(symbio):**This note extends from Hugh's initial note.  The only weapon I want to see CyberNinjas using other than their guild weapon is the Zantetsuken.  This is very beneficial towards killing Samurai.  In fact, it's probably the only way to have a chance against one.  What it does is breaks their armor thus bringing down their AC and making them more vulnerable.the dirs to the mob with zantetsuken: 10e,pass,ancient,3e,sThe Zantetsuken should be wielded right before combat, when the armors are broken, then rewield your cyber wep.-Symbio**Kyllur(symbio):**Kyllur is my executor.-Symb**Time again(pike):**Been asleep for a while now.  Don't take my vulgar language to heart but its about FUCKIN' time our guild has been given updates and power increases.  I can think of no other ancient guild that I would rather belong to.  Thanks to the Wiz's n' Directives/members involved.  A little peeved about my Enforcer status, but I get bored if there is nothing to bitch about.++2centPike**GATM(hugh):**I just doubled the balance.  Enjoy.Chax**Grandlords(pike):**If any ninja considers themselves and elder of this guild mail me for consideration of entry into the Grandlords clan.Pike**Zantetsuken(volkar):**used it to kill Gogeta. if i could get a little honor restore, it would be appreciated.**Guild(recca):**Wow.. I wanted to make a quick note on cvotes. For me at least, you will needto be an active CyberNinja to get my vote into the Ladder. I'm tired of dyingalone while defending the guild hall. I miss my brothers in arms, to help mefight those against us. You may be the best PKer there is but if you want myvote, you have to be active. I'm not interested in an inactive leadership.Let's get some people in here! Let's see some good old fashion killing. Thetype that existed back in the day.. When people respected the power of theCyberNinjas. Let us bring this guild, this family, and our honor, to poweronce more.Recca** solidarity(tenchu):**ok guys i no longer know if i command the same respect i used to or not but all of this bickering among ourselves needs to stop it is senselessthere is no point in arguing among ourselves and calling each other a coward simply solve the problem by logging in more and helping each other outi just dont see why everytime the leadership goes inactive we all have to act like childeren without the parents around to monitor usits really annoying to log in and see all the bickering and bellyaching its just disheartening reallywe are a band of brothers with one goal in mind and we need to get back to doing what we do bestkilling everyone else there used to not be days where you could log in and not see a pk from a ninja on the obits seeing that again would be greati realize that now it is just a tad harder to kill people because people tend not to stick around long enough to die but get creative and keep tryingthere is always stuff to learn its hard for someone to know everything come up with new ways to kill,trick or deceive other playersfind ways to make the game fun again and lets try to get back on the same page everyone needs to stop the bickering  and get back to killing now that i've said my peace ill let you get back to it and ill be around **POKs(tenchu):**ok im doing this on telnet so maybe some mispellings anways here goes ok guys lets try to fill up our pk board again i miss the old days of loggin on and seeing  and reading the pk logs from other cybers about who they had kills also it is a way for us to keep track of who needs honoered for what pks  anyways just remember anytime you kill somoene post it on the pk board by the shopsalute to the cyberstenchu the silent assassin**ATTN: Sensei and above(symbio):**Many of the oaths have been written wrong.  Fix this.  If you need documentation then refer to previous oaths or the guild help files.-Symb**wtf(shadowstone):**I come on and find that the guild has gone to hell, first things first, who was dumb enough to make symbio a directive? Im sick and tired of always having to "prove" myself in someway or another for my sensei status, ive earned it yet everytime some new person comes along with directive they get power hungry and decide to change it once again. Ive earned it as have others, if your going to take away something we have earned then you best be prepared to lose players as well as recruits. I have pked, its in my pk tracker, nuff said. As for the sad loss of the Intellect position, well I was aiming for it so I could actually write some lore for this guild, since only one or two ninjas actually have done this. But without it it just shows that the current leadership doesnt care about our histories, or teaching our students what it means to be a cyberninja. Oh sure pk pk pk blah blah blah, theres more to it than that, and if your using pk as an excuse to remove sensei status from non pk cyberninjas, then you might as well doom us all to a slow death. How often do I see a cyberninja come around that can sensei, maybe once every few months. If someone is looking to become a cyberninja and never is able to find a sensei, they go looking elsewhere, and if we want to be a strong guild, we need fresh blood with fresh ideas. Lastly and I say this with utmost distaste, if you cant kill someone with your cyberninja weapon, and have to resort to other methods, your in the wrong guild. Your cyberninja weapon should be all that you need. Just my view on it.We need to go back to the old ways, everyone needs to have sensei status, we need to be able to recruit, not wait for the few scant officers we have to grace us with their presence when they actually feel like logging in. I dont know about all of you, but I dont like being the only cyberninja on.Shadowstone**headline Symbio(ironman):**Last called jul 9 You want to lead us put up or get out of the wayOn an Iron Horse I rideIronman**headline Guild Politics(fawn):**Yes, this was once a great pk guild but, with all the new guilds and new gear that has been introduce we aren't what we use to be. This guild needs updates badly. So, why I ask should we have pk set if all we are going to do is die? Those of us that worked hard to max the guild were given Senseiship for doing so, who gave any one person the right to take that from us because we don't pk? That isn't how this guild or any guild works. No one person has total control in a guild. There is a body of people that set rules and reworks old ones but, not just one person. That isn't fair to the others in the guild.We need to have a directive that works for us not just glorying in his power over us and as Ironman stated we need a directive that is active more than the one we have now. For the senseiship problem, if someone wants to join us we have no way of recruiting them for the senseis don't log on and by the time they do the recruit has found a different guild to join. This should be thought long and hard on. You want more ninjas to play but, give us no way of getting more ninjas.Such a stupid idea taking sensei from us.Fawn, the honorable ninja**You want to lead us Ironman(kanji):**Then get some pks like symbio.**Symbio(ironman):**Its is now August 5th and symbio was last called july 9 Where is the leadership*No I don't want to lead But why should i log if not even our leaders log on*On an Iron horse I ride Ironman**"
