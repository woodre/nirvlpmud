messages "stun(sami):**i believe that the Stun command that cybers have should work in pk anywhere.this would make pking alot easier, and when someone decides to fight they cannot back down from there obligation**Upgrade(sami):**For far too long the cyberninjas has been a Docile guild...we have battled Many a foe and, even agenst the grimest odds, we have obtained greatness...However it is my oppinion and a few other's that i have talked to 1 for example is Doodle, believe that it is a crime that all of these guilds are getting upgraded and getting Newer and Better spells, and ways of PKing that is almost Unfair to our unchangeing guildi think we should have a few upgrades, and possibly make us better, so that we can once again rejoin the Elite Pkers and reclaim our guild's true meaning...POWER AND CONQUEST THROUGH PK^^l^^^^^^^^lq**need new wiz(sleepwalker):**I believe the issue we've all been pointing out for the last yearabout this bug, or that bug, or this problem with pk or that problem all comes down to getting a guild wizard. With a guildwizard there would be provision for answering questions. Withouta wizard one must either be content with playing ninjas how theyare, or not. Yes, we are a guild for pk, but we have no guildwizard to make that very viable. Perhaps the sacrifice needed isfor an existing cyberninja to wiz and then take on the mantle ofbeing the guild wizard. I have no idea what the mud politics wouldbe about something like this, but it seems like the best optionavailable. **"
