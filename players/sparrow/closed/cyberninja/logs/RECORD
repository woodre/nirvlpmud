Last night me and bishop had a sparring match.  I won and was not able to exit the arena.  I ran around each of the 3 levels spamming surface and looking for an exit.  I could not quit out or teleport out.  After I got a wizard to summon me out I was still temp flagged as pk.  The pk setting fixed itself on its own.
