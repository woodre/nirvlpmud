Inertia Field

     The inertia field is a powerful defensive enhancement
designed to reduce the impact of physical blows. Five triodes
are installed in key locations along the skeletal axis. During
combat, they automatically activate and generate an invisible
inertia field. This field slows the acceleration of inertial
force radially outward from the ninja. The effect of this is
to slow incoming physical blows.
