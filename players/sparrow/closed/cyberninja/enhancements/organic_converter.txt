     The Organic Converter is a molecular re-organizing
device used for healing. The converter works in three
ways. One, it acts as a small vein system where fluids
from a corpse are processed into organic compounds.
These compounds give healing value depending upon the
origin of the corpse. Secondly, the converter can
re-organize damaged molecular structures. This
regeneration is slow and occurs over a time interval
depending on your quality level. Lastly, the converter
is able to release the inherent energy in your molecules
and thus rejuvenate your energy supply. This takes place
over time like regeneration, and drains your health.
Digestion ameliorates the user's metabolism.
