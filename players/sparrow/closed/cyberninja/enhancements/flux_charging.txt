FluxCharge
Usage: fluxcharge
Cost: 15 sp/charge
 
     This command is used to charge a CyberNinja's internal power
generator up to a limit defined by the CyberNinja's guild level.
It will continue charging until the charge limit is reached, there
are no more spell points left to charge, or the charging is stopped
by repeating the 'fluxcharge' command. Once the power generator is
charged to any degree, the FluX generators can be used. Each use of
a FluX generator will lower the total fluxcharges by 1.
