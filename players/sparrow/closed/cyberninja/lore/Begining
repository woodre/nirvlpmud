In the 22nd century on a planet known as Earth.A new warrior
was born. The best assaasins from the clans of the Wolf,the 
Serpent,the Blood Dragons,and the clan of twilight were 
implanted with the first neural processors.Those processors 
allowed for communication by thought and access to massive
databases in an instant, and so was born the first cyberninjas.
The Chosen as they were called turned out to be efficient to 
the point of near perfection. When assisted by a Netrunner (a
communications/tactical specialist) a Chosen's success rate 
was 98.8% at that time it was unheard of.As decades passed 
Engineers developed new neural processors and new bio-mechanical 
enhancments,and the Chosen became even deadlier.The founding
clans became both military and political powers secretly 
controlling several small nations.
    In the mid 23rd century the Earth Alliance voted to wage
war against the clans,and so began the Fifty Year War.During
that war the need for more ninjas became paramount in the
first decade.An aggresive recruitment strategy lead to a poorer
trained ninjas lead into combat and also lead to new ranks.
Such as Cyberpunk(a probationary recruit), Cyberblade(a full
initiate),Cyberwarrior (a low skilled but up and coming ninja),
Master(a highly skilled ninja),Grandmaster(the most skilled 
ninjas in each clan).In the end though it was simply not enough.
The weaker clans were either destroyed or were absorbed by the 
larger clans The Earth Alliance was winning due to sheer 
overwhelming numbers.The Elder Chosen in thier wisdom 
started delving into temporal technology,and so the Temporal 
Orb was created.
      On November,19 2302 with the ultimate defeat of the 
clans in sight The Elder Chosen gathereed the remnants of all 
remaining clans,and through teh decision of the Cyberninja 
Conclave.They used the Temporal Orb.
     The Orb was both a success and a failure.Aiming for
20th century Earth the remnants of the once glorious clans
were thrown to a place outside of time, and so the Way was 
brought to this world now known as Nirvana.
    Scince then many of the Elder Chosen have vanished 
from the world of men taking untold secrets and technologies 
with them,a new war has replaced the old,and our struggle to
 keep the Way eternal has begun anew..

The Lore is Written by a great CyberNinja that disappeared somehow
from our world and his name was: Solstice.
The Lore was found again because of the effort and work of our
Directive: Hugh.
I thought this may help you understand or at least have a theory
of what we are.
