Fukei Shimboshi, CyberNinja of Master Sintetsu

The trials of reknowned CyberNinja Fukei Shimboshi
are that of triumph in the face of overwhelming odds.
Fukei, being small of stature and of quiet demeanor, 
was assaulted by a family of four pearl lions on his 
way to a peaceful picnic on the beach. Fukei was 
immediately pounced upon. His picnic basket went flying, 
tossing the fine meats and pastries in disarray. 
Poor Fukei himself was nearly crushed by the weight 
of the huge beasts. Without further hesitation, little 
Shimboshi attempted to unsheath his Ninja-To but 
sadly found it was broken in half. Seeing this, 
the father pearl lion named Atradaitoshu sunk
his teeth into Fukei's hand and ripped it off.
With the most blood-curdling scream any Cyber might
fear to yell, Fukei pulled his injured arm back and
plunged his broken sword into offending lion's mouth...
severing both his lifeless hand and Atradaitoshu's head.

It was at this time that Fukei was overtaken with a
strange part-mystical part-technological force. 
The power inside him was about to unleash, and the 
remaining pearl lion family was about to become one
with that which does not exist.

The story of Fukei is the story of every ninja who
was ambushed. For they can sever our hands...

but we will sever their heads.
