     Tournaments are organized challenge matches where
guild members can test their skills against each other.
They are a special part of a CyberNinja's life style.  
All ninjas are strongly encouraged to participate
in guild tournaments.  An official tournament may be 
set up by any guild officer but practice between
guild members is also encouraged.  All combat takes
place in the guild arena.

     An official tournament can only be held in the
arena, which is only accessible by honorable guild 
members.  A board has been set up outside the arena to
honor the victors of tournaments.
Before a tournament or match between guild mates all
participants shall show there honor to each other.
