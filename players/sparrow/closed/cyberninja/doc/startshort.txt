Introduction File: start
Usage: cyber <topic>


     Any interested player of appropriate level may be
recruited into the guild.  Once recruited, a player is then
allowed access into guild headquarters.  The player may then
tour the guild and decide whether or not to have CyberNinja
implants surgically installed.  Only by having this operation
does the player become a full-fledged member.

     The new CyberNinja should then read through all on-line
documentation files (the 'cyber' files).

     Now the ninja is ready to select a weapon.  This weapon
will always be with the ninja.  To select a weapon, a ninja
must visit the weapons shop.  Alternatively, the ninja may
fight with his/her hands (use the 'wep' command to focus
your Chi).

     Finally, the ninja is ready to take on the world!
At this point, ninjas should get acquainted with the guild
as much as possible.
