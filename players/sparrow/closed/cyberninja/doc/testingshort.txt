Usage: cyber <topic>

Testing prospective new recruits is a very lengthly process and
should not be taken lightly.  You have been giving the power to 
shape the guild and it's future members.  There are a few things
that we need to keep in mind when interviewing/training recruits.

     If a recruit is not patient through the recruiting process
then they will most likely fail in becoming a respected member
of the Ninjas.  Patience in battle as long as in other aspects
of the mud will serve people well.

      A recruit who is able to acomplish tasks given by the
recruiter shows that they are willing to listen and learn to
others who are able to teach them many things.  They also show
respect for the guild and it's ways.

Manditory aspects to show new members:

Guild Hirerarchy
Guild Oath
Guild tour - Different rooms/mobs and there function
Guild helps - Basic info and general guidelines
