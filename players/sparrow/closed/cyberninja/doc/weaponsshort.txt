     Ninjas use their own type of weapon.  Its strength is
dependent upon their belt level.  Different weapons vary
in the way they perform in combat.

Getting a weapon for the first time:  You must go to
  the guild weapons shop.  There you may browse the
  different types of weapons available.  When you find
  the one you like, you select it.  You may need to buy
  it, so make sure you have enough credits.  Once you have
  selected your weapon, you may use it at any time.

Changing your weapon:  Because you may only use one ninja
  weapon at any one time, you must change your weapon at the
  weapons shop.  This costs experience and a small service
  fee.
