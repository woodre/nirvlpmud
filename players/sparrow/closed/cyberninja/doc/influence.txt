Operation File: influence
Usage: cyber <topic>


     Role-playing is a large part of the CyberNinja guild.
The CyberNinja guild compute engine knows this, and has
assigned certain players stones of influence. You can see
these stones in each other's eyes. So, to know what a
ninja's eyes are made of is to know their influence.

     Guild positions are an important element in making
the guild successful. These positions, called influences, 
are entirely player controlled. Thus, players decide 
amongst themselves the organization they wish to live by.

     Higher positions have authority and say over lower
positions. They are able to promote/demote those of lower
office than them.

_______________________________________


Sensei:
  Trainer and senior member of the guild. Though any
  ninja may train other ninjas below their belt level,
  Senseis may train ninjas at any belt level. Sensei
  can also recruit new members. Sensei do not report
  into the guild officer hierarchy, though they respect
  its authority and follow its general guidelines.  The
  Sensei reports directly to the Intellect and impliments 
all training requirements.

Enforcer:
  Enforcers are the "punishers" of the guild. They must be
  PK most of the time for obvious reasons, and be effective 
  PK fighters (the guild's reputation as PK relies heavily
  upon its Enforcers). Enforcers are responsible for guild 
  security, and may view guild logs. Enforcers report to 
  the Executor and the Directive. Enforcers have all 
  Sensei abilities.

Intellect:
  True artisan and thinker of the guild. An Intellect is
  brought on to a Directive's team to specialize in 
  political and environment enhancement. An Intellect
  reports to the Executor and Directive. PK is an option 
  for an Intellect, but not a requirement. Intellects have
  all Sensei abilities.  An Intellect is charged with the
  training of Sensei's.

Mentat:
This office serves no role in the guild office hierarchy. A 
Mentat is personally appointed by a Matrix to provide consultation 
and assistance on special guild projects. There is no method on how 
to become a Mentat... basically, if you are deemed knowledgeable in 
a certain area, you might be appointed.  Mentats have only the 
powers of Sensei.  Mentats can be created and removed at the whim 
of the Matrix.  Mentats have all the powers of a Sensei.

Executor:
  An Executor reports directly to his/her Directive, and
  serves as that Directive's right-hand. Executors have
  most of the Directive's powers, and provide replacement
  authority if the Directive is not present. Ideally,
  only one Executor should correspond to one Directive.
  Executors are expected to have a significant amount of
  PK experience, and should be mostly PK while in office.
  Executors have all Sensei abilities.

Directive:
  The Directive holds supreme authority and power.
  All guild offices, except Sensei, are designed to
  be built around a Directive. Each Directive will have
  his/her own entourage of an Executor, Intellect, and
  Enforcers. Thus, there may be multiple Directives, but
  the lower officers report to, and are only expected
  to be truly loyal to, their Directive. Directives
  should have an extensive PK background, but it is
  not a requirement that Directives currently PK.
  Directives have all Executor abilities, and more.

Agent:
  A wizard who has come to help maintain and improve
  our CyberNinja world. Agents are classified into
  different Spheres of Influence themselves. Spheres
  correspond to how they play a role in the guild.
  Electra          ->  Intensive code manipulation
  Nuclea           ->  Guild security and competition
  Magneta          ->  People organization, relations
  Mystica          ->  Guild atmosphere, theme
  ElectroMagnetica ->  Manager of Electra & Magneta
  NucleoMystica    ->  Manager of Nuclea & Mystica

Matrix:
  Makers of the very CyberNinja world itself. Matrices
  oversee the general health of the guild and implement
  functional changes. They own the guild and have final
  say - but of course choose to let the players run
  their own world.
