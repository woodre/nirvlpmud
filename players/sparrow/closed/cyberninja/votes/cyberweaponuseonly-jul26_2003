Vote Name : [cyberweaponuseonly-jul26_2003], a 14 day vote.
Vote Owner: Doodle
This vote is Open and the issue is:
     I feel we should go back to using only our given cyber weapons.  Zantetsuken, lifeblood, etc are nice, but I think it takes away from the theme and history of our guild.  Vote 'yea' if you agree and wish to only use ninja weapons.  'nay' means you want to keep things as they are (can use any weapon)
