Vote Name : [voting_on_officers-jul21_2004], a 30 day vote.
Vote Owner: Shadowstone
This vote is Open and the issue is:
     This is a vote to VOTE IN our officers like how it should be and has. This will effect two things, one is by replacing all guild officers especially doodle's new position, he wasnt voted in, it wasnt discussed. We as players need to decide who is qualified, not the wizards. Until the issue is solved all possitions will be kept. Cast yea = yes we want to vote for our guild officers, nay = no I dont want to take the time for votings, I trust the wizards
