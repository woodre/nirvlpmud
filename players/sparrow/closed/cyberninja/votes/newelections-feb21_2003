Vote Name : [newelections-feb21_2003], a 14 day vote.
Vote Owner: Sleepwalker
This vote is Secret and the issue is:
     The Cyberninjas need to re-assess our leadership. Our current leadership serves us well. However, we've lost the instruction and influence we usually gain from some in the leadership for various reasons. Myself and other exerienced ninjas call for a complete re-election of the CyberNinja leadership. Offices affected will be: Enforcer, Intellect, Executor and Directive. Current officeholders may fight again for the same rank or a different one, and other ninjas may attempt election or be recommended by others. Details will be finalized pending the outcome of this vote. To conclude, this is about making sure our leadership *today* is as current, relevant and involved as cybernetically possible. Currency is what makes the leadership of this guild strong and agile. CYBERNINJA! ~thanks~ theSLEEP
