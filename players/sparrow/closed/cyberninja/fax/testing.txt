   The Testing, the series of tasks which determine if
potential guild members are recruited, is composed of
the following steps. They can be completed in any order,
and it is up to the recruiter to see that they get done.

   The Oath
To all currently logged on CyberNinjas, the player must 
recite the Oath and then bow in respect. The Oath must
be recited in full, and a bow must follow it.
The Oath is:
  I, myName, swear that I will respect my fellow
  CyberNinjas, master their lethal ways,
  and keep the guild's best interests close to
  my heart.

   The Aging
The player must age one hour. This waiting period will
eliminate all casual interest that a potential recruit
may have. The goal is to remove casual interest with
devotion. The player will be older and more wiser
when he/she enters the guild.

Once the potential member completes the above tasks,
that player may be recruited. However, the Testing is
not yet finished. One final task must be performed 
before the recruit actually joins the guild. This task
is the posting of a note on the Oath Board.
The note must contain the Oath along with the reason
why the player wanted to join the guild.

As a recruiter, you are capable of recruiting only a
very limited number of times. So, choose your recruitees
wisely. However, know that if any of your recruits gains
enough experience in the guild to reach master of his/her
martial arts discipline, then that recruit slot is freed
up and you may recruit another player. Thus, it is in
your best interest to recruit those who will work to 
master their art.

However, recruiters have great chances to improve
their honor. When a new player is recruited, all ninjas
who witness the new recruit join the guild are
encouraged to honor the recruiter significantly.
Thus, it works out better for the new recruit to
join the guild when there are many ninjas logged on.
It also works out better for the new recruit, because
all ninjas currently logged on will hand over a welcome
gift. It is encouraged that all ninjas there were not
logged on also provide a gift to a new member if they
have not already done so.
