Fax File: executor
Usage: fax <topic>


     The Executor is the right hand man/woman of the Directive.
This office handles managing the Directive's entourage of
lower officers... there should be only one Executor per
Directive. The Executor also provides replacement authority
while the Directive is not present.

     Executors should have extensive PK experience so that
they may provide effective direction while the Directive
is not present. Executors should attempt to be PK while in office,
but this is somewhat flexible as Enforcers serve as the PK guard.

dnet <message>
     Send a message through CyberDaemon. This will reach
     all ninjas whether they are muffled or not.
empower <member> <position> [grent/remove]
     The 'empower' command is the all powerful command
     that gives members guild offices or takes them away.
     'yes' means give the player the position, 
     'no'  means take the position away.
     Type 'empower' by itself for a list of types.
fax <topic>
     Allows you to view the Cyberninja officer files. 
     Usage is exactly like the 'cyber' command.
     By typing 'fax' alone, a list of topics is presented.
     Please keep the contents of these files to yourself
     and other officers.
gbalance
     Allows you to see the credit account balances of all 
     currently logged on guild members.
onet <message>
     Guild officer channel tell. Use this command exactly
     like 'net', your message goes to only guild officers.
onem <message>
     Guild officer channel emote. See also 'onet'.
recruit <player>
     Allows you to recruit a player into the guild.
     See 'cyber recruit' for more info.
recruits
     Allows you to see who you are currently counseling
     as well as your remaining recruit slots.
train <member>
     Allows you to train a fellow CyberNinja in the martial
     arts, thus allowing that ninja to advance in art level.
     The student ninja will need to have the required xp
     in order to be trained successfully.
uncounsel <player>
     Allows you to uncounsel a player you have recruited.
     If you use this command to uncounsel a player who
     is already a member of the guild, then you will lose
     honor but your recruit slot will be freed up, so try to
     recruit players who might be successful in the guild.
     If you uncounsel a player who is not a member of the
     guild, there is no honor penalty.
unrenegade <member> [commit]
     Without typing "commit", lets you see the Renegade
     status of a member. If you type "commit" after the
     name of the ninja (as specified in usage above), it
     removes the Renegade status from a Renegade ninja.
     That ninja will then again follow the path of honor.
     Honor is reset to that of a new guild member.
report <what>
     Allows you to report the winner of a match.
     Tournament name should be included.  Comments or
     disqualifications may be noted as well.
tourney
     This shows the contents of the tournament report file.
     All reports written will be shown.
suspend <member>
     Allows you to suspend a member from the guild.
     Unsuspend removes suspension. Suspension will disable
     the member's guild object, but object will still
     remain on the player.
