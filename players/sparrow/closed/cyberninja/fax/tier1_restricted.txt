Fax File: tier1
Usage: fax <topic>


     Tier 1 wizards are the guild owners.
Around 1995, the CyberNinja guild was written by two Tier 1
wizards in a collaborative thought exploring effort.
Since then, the guild has evolved significantly, and several 
other wizards have lent their skills and talents as code 
contributors and policy makers.

     There is nothing an administrator cannot do, and no
limit per se to his involvement in how the guild runs.
However, it is the purpose that the CyberNinja guild be
player run, and that players determine what a CyberNinja
really is.

     Tier 1 wizards have final say and responsibility for 
the guild. All changes to the guild code must be approved
by a Tier 1 wizard, unless that change is minor or made by 
a Nirvana senior/admin wiz for purposes of rule compliancy.
And of course, if none of the Tier 1 wizards ever log on
(which is OK because the guild is self-maintaining), 
the approval process is given to the manager-appointee.

_______________Administrative Commands________________
add_credits <member> <credit_amount>
     'add_credits' adds on an amount of credits specified.
addxp <member> <xp_points>
     'addxp' adds on an amount of guild experience specified.
change_honor <member> <#honor_points>
     Changes the number of honor points a member has to the
     points specified.
dnet <message>
     Send a message through CyberDaemon. This will reach
     all ninjas whether they are muffled or not.
empower <member> <position> [yes/no]
     The 'empower' command is the all powerful command
     that gives members guild offices or takes them away.
     'yes' means give the player the position, 
     'no' means take the position away.
     Type 'empower' by itself for a list of types.
enhance <member> <quality_level>
     'enhance' changes the quality level of a guild member.
     The quality level is the numeric rating of a neural
     chip. Chip rankings go from 1 to 10.
     Use this command sparingly, because the chip name
     string must also be changed... which is a hassle.
enhancements <who>
     By typing in a name of a guild member after the
     enhancements command, you may see their enhancements.
     You may see your own by normally just typing
     'enhancements'.
execute <member>
     This is a last resort. Use very sparingly.
     Execution kills the guild member and destroys
     all guild status. It is a way to kick a guild member
     out of the guild, dishonorably.
fax <topic>
     Allows you to view the Cyberninja officer files. 
     Usage is exactly like the 'cyber' command.
     By typing 'fax' alone, a list of topics is presented.
     Please keep the contents of these files to yourself
     and other officers.
gbalance
     Allows you to see the credit account balances of all 
     currently logged on guild members.
logend/logall <logFile>
     Allows you to view all CyberNinja guild logs.
     logend looks at the tail end of the log, logall looks
     at the entire file.. page by page. Typing in logend
     or logall without an argument will list all logs.
onet <message>
     Guild officer channel tell. Use this command exactly
     like 'net', your message goes to only guild officers.
onem <message>
     Guild officer channel emote. See also 'onet'.
recruit <player>
     Allows you to recruit a player into the guild.
     See 'cyber recruit' for more info.
recruits
     Allows you to see who you are currently counseling
     as well as your remaining recruit slots.
rehash <member>
     This command refreshes the guild command mapping.
     It should be used when a command is either added
     or removed from the guild.
report <what>
     Allows you to report the winner of a match.
     Tournament name should be included.  Comments or
     disqualifications may be noted as well.
set_art_level <member> <number>
     'set_art_level' changes a ninja's belt level to the
     level specified.  The level must be a number.  
     Level 1 is a white belt, level 7 and above are black 
     belts. For example, black belt degree 10 is art level 17.
     Guild experience is not modified.
set_immortal <wizard> <sphere>
     Assigns a guild wizard into a sphere of influence.
     Use this command to set/change a guild wizard's role
     in the guild. Type 'set_immortal' with no arguments
     to obtain a list of spheres. No wizard shall be
     in the guild without having a defined role.
set_weapon <member> <weapon>
     'set_weapon' changes a ninja's weapon to the weapon
     specified. Guild credits and guild experience are not
     modified. Be careful when setting a ninja's weapon.
     If you type in the wrong name, the ninja will not be
     able to summon his/her weapon.
suspend/unsuspend <member>
     Allows you to suspend a member from the guild.
     Unsuspend removes suspension. Suspension will disable
     the member's guild object, but object will still
     remain on the player.
tourney
     This shows the contents of the tournament report file.
     All reports written will be shown.
uncounsel <player>
     Allows you to uncounsel a player you have recruited.
     If you use this command to uncounsel a player who
     is already a member of the guild, then you will lose
     honor but your recruit slot will be freed up, so try to
     recruit players who might be successful in the guild.
     If you uncounsel a player who is not a member of the
     guild, there is no honor penalty.
unrenegade <member> [commit]
     Without typing "commit", lets you see the Renegade
     status of a member. If you type "commit" after the
     name of the ninja (as specified in usage above), it
     removes the Renegade status from a Renegade ninja.
     That ninja will then again follow the path of honor.
     Honor is reset to that of a new guild member.
upall
     This will update the guild object of all guild members.
     This works by destroying the old object and cloning a
     new object to every guild member.
view_honor <member>
     Allows you to view the number of honor points and the
     accompanying rank name that the guild member has.
