Fax File: enforcer
Usage: fax <topic>


     Enforcers are the "punishers" and security of the
guild. They must be experienced and effective in PK, as
the guild's reputation in PK highly relies upon this
office. Enforcers also serve as law enforcement inside
the guild, as dictated by the Enforcer's Executor or
Directive. Enforcers must mostly be PK while in office.
