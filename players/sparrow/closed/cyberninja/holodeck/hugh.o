long_desc "Hugh's workroom is a private place used to clear ones' thoughts.  You see several mats with incense and candles to allow one to better clear their thoughts.In one well lit corner you see the heads of several killed knights and a couple scalps where Hugh and some other Cyberninjas attacked and killed their victim.In the other corner you see a training circle used by Hugh and his students to train and perfect their deadly arts.  There are several patches of blood where the training became too intense and had to be stopped before permant damage was done.On the wall hangs a list of those who have wronged the Cyberninjas and Hugh, himself.Also on that same wall you see a naginata, the same one used on Hugh's first player killing.  It is enshrined in honor, and you can still see the dried blood of proserpine on it."
