Note: NO SPELL/POWER MAY BE USED AGAINST PLAYERS
      (make sure all complies with this)

mechs/mech.c   change this to cover the changes made to
               /players/snow/closed/cyber/mech.c
               said changes:
                 set_heart_beat() call to be placed in
                 reset(arg) not in init()
                 in heartbeat take out the sp drain to
                 the attacker if the attacker is a player
               also look below at snow/mechs and compare

objects/driod.c  change this so that the droids may not pick up
                 nor carry money (this is so that the unlimited
                 money bag is not created)
                 
object/cyber_mail.c  no offense but isnt one mail system enough?
                     i feel there is no need for more mem for mail
                     
lib_genCmds/transfer.c  redo to follow /doc/build/RULES/teleports

lib_genCmds/xfer.c  same as above

lib_advCmds/lead.c  make sure it can not be used vs players 

lib_advCmds/ncon.c  make the 100's into 10's- no exact numbers!

lib_advCmds/p1.c  make the random(21) to random(20) and why exactly do
                  guild leaders get extra bonuses above that of norm?
                  (or make the cost match that of /doc/build/RULES/
                  guild_spells)
                  
lib_advCmds/p2.c  same as above except nubers are different

lib_advCmds/p3.c  same as above

lib_advCmds/retreat.c  cost of "peace" spells will be changed to about
                       100 sp for mass, 120 for specific

lib_advCmds/roomspy.c is illegal, this is not to be used at all

lib_advCmds/shadows.c should follow costs of teleports, i.e. 55 sp
                      i suggest 40 noncombat, 70 in combat
                      
lib_advCmds/stun.c  is illegal

lib_advCmds/transto.c  cost of 200 is fine but this should follow the
                       other requirements in /doc/build/RULES/teleports
                       (i.e. usage of obj/base_tele.c)

lib_tools/digest.c  justification of cost for this power is needed
                    otherwise this is illegal (in short: the cost is 
                    not enough to merit this power at all)
                    
lib_tools/eflux.c   why does the guild leaders get the extra punch?

lib_tools/emt.c  take a look above at retreat.c

lib_tools/hflux.c  same as eflux.c

lib_tools/mflux.c  same as above

lib_tools/overload.c  make sure that this does not affect players

lib_tools/reg.c    there should be some random loss in transfer

lib_tools/rej.c    same as above

snow/mechs   the pricing of mechs of 2k to 20k is a bit low 
             i suggest 8k to 60k
             also, make sure that set_heart_beat(1) is ONLY called 
             in the reset(arg) of the mech.c [laser.c for instance
             calls it again]
             also, add_exp() in mech.c  - the amount handed over to
             the player should be a fraction, else the player could 
             have the pet attack and never lift a finger and get xp
             suggestion of fraction would be 1/10 or 1/15
             make sure that when stopping a mech in combat that the
             opponent does not completely stop the attack should
             it be attacking another- i.e. no free peace spells
             make sure "kami" does not allow for mechs to smash into
             pets
             there should be a sp cost of the player as well when doing
             a "kami"
             mech_guard- make sure can not be used in combat with a pet
             
snow/weapons  wepmanager.c- drop the multiple attack max to 3
              5 attacks per round every hb is waaaay too much on 
              cpu- in short lag producer
              note: the weapons are still subject to scrunity
                    as a very close examination is needed
                    
arena.c   note: set_pl_k() is a static function and thus can not be
                called.  in short a player can drop pk without a
                "real" death
                i.e. this is not approved
