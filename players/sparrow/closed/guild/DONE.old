SPARROW
Modified _exhibition to take into account charisma and luck

modified _convert to take into account charisma, piety
and luck. weighted each one accordingly

Created _darkness cmd that clones darkness object to
player with light level equal to rank*-1 darkness object
costs 2sp per round. If this causes light level of the
room to dip below 1 then the cost is 1sp. See below
Oh, _darkness is a toggle so if there is already darkness
on the player it is removed.

Added check in BWO.c heart_beat to check light level
of room. Light level less than 1 heals 1 sp per hb.
Heals more hps based on the light level of the room.

created channel (bt / be)
modified extra_look to use write() rather than return
 - this was because return adds a period
basic "assert" command
mock "btitle" command
put back in wield changes to ritualized weapon special
added it so players can't wield weapons with a specialized msg.
added in ac cap of 10


added alignment-based wc mod
added light-based wc mod
added "bsave" - this points to the std guild object i created's
 save functionality, which also fires when quit or save is done.
added "bupdate", a guild object updating cmd

added dodge ability to guild object armor special. this will need
  tweaking. the numbers are horribly off.
  at max attribs, and 0 weight, it gives a 100% chance of 90%
  blocking damage. heh. obviously not what we are intending.

added rank-based wc mod
started writing multiple attacks... what are chances based on ?

where are you ?
