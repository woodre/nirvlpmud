  The priest smiles gently at you and says, "Ah, a Neophyte. How nice."
  "As you may already know," he continues his lecture, "you are to go
through a series of trials to prove your worth in the guild. For each
trial you succesfully pass, you will gain certain abilities. Keep in
mind that every ability will first flourish when you attain a certain
rank in the guild."
  The priest pauses slightly and says, "Now, your first trial will be
to bring a fresh corpse to me. With it, I can perform the ritual of
sacrifice to have you properly initiated in the guild."
  "Make haste, and remember that the corpse must be fresh and of good
quality," he adds enthusiastically.
