  The dragon keeper eyes you suspiciously and asks, "Are you certain
you are ready for this trial? Believe me when I say that your trials
have been easy until now."
  The firm expression on your face demands the keeper to continue.
With a grin he says, "You will meet your trial in the dungeon under
the grating set in the floor on which we stand. Down there in the
darkness my champion awaits you. Defeat it and you will be granted
the power to control dragons."
  "But be warned, in a bad way be he who comes ill prepared", he says
solemnly, "Just say 'I am ready' when you are, and I shall open the
grating. And it will stay shut, if you are not victorious."
