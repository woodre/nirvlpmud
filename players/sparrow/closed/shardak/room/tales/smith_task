  The smith pauses for a moment and says, "I heard a story in the
Inn the other night. It is told that far away in a tall tower a noble
knight holds a beautiful blessed blade named 'The Holy Avenger'.
Forging this weapon into an instrument of evil is a deed I must do.
Retrieve me this blade and I shall reward you well."
  Quickly he returns to his work.
