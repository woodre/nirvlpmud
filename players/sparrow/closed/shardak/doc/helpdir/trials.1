	  |/    |    There are  two ways  of increasing    |
	       /    one's skills within the guild,  by    /
	      |    advancing  in rank  and by passing    |
	      |    the  trials as  instructed by  the    |
	     /    mentors within  the guild caverns.    /
	    |    The most powerful  spells of every    |
	    |    attained rank are accompanied by a    |
	     \    trial, which must be passed before    \
	      |    one can take full benefit of one's    |
	       \    rank. Ask the mentors for instruc-    \
		|    tions, e.g. say What is your trial?   |
