Testing simple FTP deploy. I am not optimistic.

Use log_file to write a log. It will write to the /log directory and
append to the file.
Example:
log_file("ADVANCE", ctime() + " " +cap_name+" advanced to level "+level+"
")
This will write to /log/ADVANCE


Wizards do not detox, so if you drink alcohol you end up with
a never ending buzz lol
I use the exec command to clear my intox:
exec this_player()->add_intoxination( this_player()->query_intoxination() * -1 )
However you can't use exec yet so you'll have to build a command into your
wiz tool.


Here is the difference between lp and LD for paths
that have the correct leading slash:
lp:
Valid Write: /players/pavlik/guild/mages/helps2/news ob: players/pavlik/guild/mages/gob#1862
LD:
Valid Write: /players/pavlik/guild/mages/helps2/news ob: obj/player#841
.
It looks like the calling object is different...

With the stock 2.4.5 mudlib that comes with LDmud, everything works as
planned.  I reverted some master/simul stuff back to that stock, and
have narrowed the issue down to the resolv_path simul_efun.  That's
where the path isn't getting calculated correctly, which adds the
current path when it's not supposed to, adds a slash, etc....

We should just need to fix that simul_efun to work properly (or as
expected) and our issues should go away.

I'm guessing it's because cat() is now an sefun instead of an efun - so it's
getting introduced into the stack.  I think we can get it to allow
any obj/simul_efun call valid_write somewhere in master.c - if i remember
correctly.
