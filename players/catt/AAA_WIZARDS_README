Wizards:
   If you are looking at my code this is how it is organized:
      1) AREAS - dir contains all area room directories and
                 the master include file "base_defines" which
                 has all the macros in it for increased 
                 portability and simplified coding.(nothing fancy)
      2) ARM - dir contains all armours - typically non magical
               although I plan on fixing this at some point.
      3) WPN - dir contains all weapons.
      4) MISC - dir contains miscellaneous items.
      5) MAGICAL - dir contains magical items, weapons, armours.
      6) NPC - dir contains monsters and npc's.
      7) GUILD - dir contains all guild dirs and files.
      8) things - dir contains mixed files. Most of which are
                  not in the game. Kind of a work area of stuff.
                  Wizared toys, etc.

   I would appreciate it if you would not modify my code without
   good reason. Adding ansi options and things of this nature
   without talking to me first is rude, please don't do it. If the
   change is to conform with current mud balance then please
   document the change in the code with:
      a) Date Modified
      b) Who Modified
      c) Why Modified
   I would also appreciate a mud mail, if it is only one file that
   has been changed, or a txt file placed in my home dir titled, 
   "QUALITY_CONTROL.txt" that lists the files that have been 
   changed or modified.
