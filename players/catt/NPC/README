*******************************************
         File Name Legend Key

Each npc belongs to a specific area. That
area will have a two or three character
code as the first part of the file name so
folks know which area any particular npc
is cloned in.


   VAL - Valley
   ZOM - Zombie Land
   TEM - Temple
   OV - Orc Village
   MK - Malacs Keep
   HAL - Hall of Worlds
   MNT - Mount (goblin mountain)

If a npc does not have an area identifier it may 
not be in game play.
