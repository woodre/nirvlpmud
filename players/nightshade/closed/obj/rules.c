Dear wizard:
  Here are the updated rules for creation.  I'd appreciate if you could
  review your code to make sure it follows these rules.  If you have any
  objects that you feel deserve special consideration, please mail me the
  filenames and/or discuss them with me.

Thank you!              - Merlyn

These are guidelines. If you want a monster to have higher something, lower
something else, or vice versa.  Remember that all monsters above level 19
give the same experience when killed.

NOTE: Treasure values are ABSOLUTE! You may not modify those.
** value is the total of ALL items AND cash contained on monster.

************************* HEALING RULES *************************

Count HP and SP healed SEPARATELY.  this_player()->heal_self(20) is 40 pts.

- ALL HEALING OR SOBERING sold in containers MUST have the value of the
  container added to its price.

- non-intox healing 60 coins per pt. NO exceptions.

- Intox healing:

  drink_alcohol(14 and up);  == cost of 9 coins per point
  drink_alcohol(12 - 14);    == cost of 10 - 14 coins per point
  drink_alcohol(10 - 11);    == cost of 15 coins per point
  drink_alcohol(7 - 9);      == cost of 15 - 20 coins per point
  drink_alcohol(6 or less);  == cost of 20 coins per point

- Non - Portable Coffee (sobering) rules:

  drink_alcohol(-1)          == 20 coins.
  drink_alcohol(-2)          == 20 coins.

  For every -1 drink_alcohol() after -2, add 20 coins to the cost, provided
  it is non-portable and limited at -10.  Anything above that must cost 3000
  coins.

- Portable Coffee (sobering) rules:

  Boltar insists that a full heal of the player MUST cost 10,000 coins.  This
  means all HP and SP restored and no intox.  So, since a high intox healing
  costs about 4000 coins to heal the player, a full detox must cost 6000
  coins.  Remember, this rule is negotiable, since players nowadays have even
  higher HP and SP limits due to extra-levels and guild powers.  Be sure to
  discuss this with me or another administrator.

*************************** WEAPONS *****************************

Standard weapons must be below wc 16.
Hard-to-get weapons can be up to wc 20.
Weapons with disadvantages can be up to wc 22, but ONLY with permission.
REMEMBER! WC is limited at 22.
Any weapon with more than wc 22 will NOT work properly!

*************************** ARMORS *****************************

Armors of type 'armor' can be up to ac 3.
Hard to get armors of type 'armor' can be up to ac 4.
Armors with disadvantages can be up to ac 5, but ONLY with permission.
Armors of any other type can ONLY be ac 1.  No exceptions.
REMEMBER! The player's AC is limited at 9.
Any AC above that number will NOT work properly!
