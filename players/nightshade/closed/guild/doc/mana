Cleric's Guild:  mana

Mana points is the power source that allows healing. This can only be
raised by offering corpse to Matry, the god of healing. Healing is a
very rare thing. Think of this as a bonus and not a must thing in the
guild. Healing is so powerful that it may only be done a certain amount
of times every reboot. This is determined by your guild level and faith point.
