Syntax: c_who [list]

Lists current logged on players in your clan, along
with their HP/SP status, and number of coins.

An optional argument 'list' can be supplied, consisting
of players names, separated by commas. If given, only
those players will be shown.

Example: 'c_who' would show everyone logged on in your clan.
         'c_who bob,john' would only show Bob's and John's info
         (assuming they are in your clan).
