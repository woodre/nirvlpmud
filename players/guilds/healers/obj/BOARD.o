But where there is the dedicationto our purpose?  Strength does not comefrom taking the clear path.We carefully guard the source of our powers.We work to conserve our energies so we mayultimately apply them to our purpose.  Thenthe fabric of our world costs us that when wemove through it.In trught this is indeed a great frustration.  ButI have little pity for those who would not riskthemselves in the fulfillment of our purpose.We do not heal for ourselves.If you came among us looking for a simplepath perhaps you should reconsider yourchoice.

Healers of the World UNITE!pps.  The Healers will always be something I was proud of.**hi all,I spoke to a Senoir Wiz and asked about our recent changes. I was told that there have been changes to the shield spell, the amount of experience we receive in parties and healing ourselves.The shield spell has been changed, those shielded will take more damage from hits.The amount of experience gained by partying has been reduced. Remember we originally only received expereince by healing others.Finally, when we heal ourself we shall only be healed by hit points (hp).  So out spell ponts will not be healed from one's healing ability.Just wanted to share what I now know with all :)Max, the Healer.**Seeing it is so hard to gain xp ..how abut if the cost of casting spells be lessened? It is hard enough to make it ..without loseing it in casting. Be nice too, if healers ..like tanks, had saveable items that they could arm up with befor they go out to help. I only have one thing that saves as far as helping in sps. So..I have plenty of open spots left :) Thanks, Angelique**I agree that there should be more done. It would be wonderful if therewere some more things we could be doing with ourselves other than healingother people. Quests, perhaps, to gain items or new spells. As it is now,the guild seems very empty. I hope there is someone out there that is stilllistening and interested in keeping our guild progressing toward a betterfuture.-Soria**I read Angelique's note earlier about hp to sp, there is a way I dont know where it is, but getting red spheres will heal sp to max and sap some life. Just thought I would give you a idea of what to keep an eye for or ask for or get yourselves. very handy for those with lots of spAngelus**Hey i just wanted to put out a suggestion .. you know how when we veiw our need statistics.. it sais everyone who is not a wizard...(or those that are invisible of corse).... Ii was thinking that maybe since we cant heal certain guild members such as necro's etc... why dont we exclude them from the need statistics as well... because if anyone is like me... they automaticlly heal without looking on accident... i dont know just a suggestion !~ Kirabrat ~**Greetings, fellow healers!The hall has become so quiet, and I fear that very few of us have time to followour chosen profession anymore.  Occasionally, I see a few of you on --Chaney, Pino, a few others -- but it is rare indeed that there aretwo or more healers on at once.  Would everyone who returns to the Hallplease post a brief note to let the others know that you are here?I, for one, would love to hear from my fellow healers.Also, Wocket, are you still around and assisting us with guild issues?If so, I would love to talk with you, and ask a few questions about the futureof our guild.Thank you so much, and I await your replies with hope.Yours,Feyth**hi! just wanted to post a quick note to let Feyth and other members that i am around...i pop on every so often, just gets a little lonely..when people dont need healingbut i hope to see you all soon!*Charm***I am here now and then.Sincerely,Tim the Wayward Healer**Hey feyth,Im here a good bit when i can. If i can be here more often i would. But real life calls at times.Have fun eevryone!The Teenage Healer~ Sabrina ~**hi, i log on very occasionally, this note is 6 months late from your original posti do still pop on and see who's about, cast the odd defendas far as party healing, i'm just not on long enough for that anymoremaybe see you around**Just thought I would let you all know that I have just decided to become a healer in the land.  I hope to meet every one of you fine people before my time in this world is done.  Although there have been some complaints as to the effectiveness of my healing abilities I hope to learn them well and be the best healer I can.  Look forward to seeing you all out there.Moirane**Welcome, Moirane!It is wonderful to have you among our ranks.  If I can assist in any way, or if you have any questions, you have only to ask.**two ideas, one, add a list_need command to see who is on our need monitor, sometimes I forget who is on it and have to relog to add others. Second idea is since we have the detox capability to add the food and soak tox into our need_monTormentor**Technically Im in Retired mode but I have decided totake on the Healers again at least.  Aingeal is alsowilling to help out (thank you Aingeal).  So I am slowly getting back up to speed for a bit, butplease feel free to mail me or to postany suggestions, comment, etc.Thanx- Mythos**1. list_need will now show you your current settings for who is on your need list2. expanded the need monitor to include intox (i), stuffed (f), soak (s)3. added in a toggle_need_level which will switch between the now newer default need mon and the old need mon which only showed hp,sp,and infuse.please say thank you to tormentor for the suggestions. - Mythos**  If you dmg a mob you can then heal the mob for xp. Its a small ammount of xp.  -- coda**I think the need room command would be really cool if it would list the heal tox for the people also. The main need doesn't need it, but if I'm healing multiple people in a room it is a pain to need name them all.**It currently shows healtest, and also dakeyras who might have once been a healer, but is now a cyberninja.**I decided to join the healers, I like the thought that we can help others.I am still very new to the whole mud thing, but I am getting there.I just thought I would let everyone know about me**This guild needs a Wizard that is willing to fix the guild up. Certain things don't work, or should work better, etc. For instance the sp solo heal, or the hp solo heal don't work.HP heal is just like the heal command. It heals both for the same sp cost. The SP heal doesn't even work. It always says the person is too tox'd unless they are at 0%.Anyways, just a thought. I don't see any other healers on ever, and it's probably cause the only way to gain exp is based on the willingness of other players.That makes leveling as a healer harder than what the outcome is worth. I stay because I personally like the guild, but I can see why there aren't too many others. Anyway, that's enough (mostly useless to you) crap from me. :)~l~h**So, one more issue is exp. Probably brought up before, but the fact is it is still easier to gain exp from killing than it is healing. And this is saying a lot since our exp from parties is nerfed soo much.There needs to be either: A) An increase in healing exp. B) Less of a exp restriction on killing exp. C) Some other means of gaining exp. Maybe have healer quests or something for exp? With more and more evil guilds, it is even harder to find people willing to be healed.Also, on the side of our powers... It is rediculous. Our powers cost us exp, massive coins, etc. For what?? Every other guild has almost the same powers that cost just SP. The exp issue wouldn't be so bad if the power was worth it, but lets face it.. Every guild can now heal, calm, increase AC, etc. Except they can earn exp by killing (the easiest method on this mud), and don't pay exp and coins to do so.This guild needs a big rehaul, in a bad way. Maybe new powers (that other guilds haven't/won't take over for themselfs), maybe new ways for healers to gain exp.. Something.**Just an idea, but what if healers gained a small bit of expfor healing themselfs as well? I'm thinking either half thenormal exp rate, or even a fourth. Eh?**I will heal all of Nirvana!**So was stopping by.  Its been a long time.  Dont even know if there areany Healers left.  let me know :)- Mythos**At least, a few of us are.  We miss you, Mythos.  :)**hi! just wanted to post a quick note to let Feyth and other members that i am around...i pop on every so often, just gets a little lonely..when people dont need healingbut i hope to see you all soon!*Charm***hi! just wanted to post a quick note to let Feyth and other members that i am around...i pop on every so often, just gets a little lonely..when people dont need healingbut i hope to see you all soon!*Charm***hi! just wanted to post a quick note to let Feyth and other members that i am around...i pop on every so often, just gets a little lonely..when people dont need healingbut i hope to see you all soon!*Charm***hi! just wanted to post a quick note to let Feyth and other members that i am around...i pop on every so often, just gets a little lonely..when people dont need healingbut i hope to see you all soon!*Charm***hi! just wanted to post a quick note to let Feyth and other members that i am around...i pop on every so often, just gets a little lonely..when people dont need healingbut i hope to see you all soon!*Charm***Seeing it is so hard to gain xp ..how abut if the cost of casting spells be lessened?
