    For a time He wandered, doing experiments and researching the
nature of what He saw as Truth and the world.  A few people came to
Him in search for knowledge and He refused them.  Finally, He allowed 
them to access His library.  These few were Us- I <Lamerith>, Cardiou,
Balberith, Horlach, and Rosier.  We built our Great Library and 
created our Order.  He taught little and soon disappeared, much to our
fear.  
    Slowly, our Order strengthened and grew.  Power came and grew with
Us.  And also did strife.  Discontent grew and hatred powered.  I could
only see one end to it all, and that end came.
    Horlach began to learn things of a nature that frightened us.  He
began to demand things of Us that was not to be and a battle was fought.
Rosier was lost to Us on that day and so were many others of our Order.
Finally Horlach fled and left Us to bind our wounds.  Where Horlach is,
is unknown, and that is a danger that must be fixed.  
    Now I must lay the pen aside, for the telling of the rest of our 
Chronicles is no longer my task.  I leave this for you my children.
