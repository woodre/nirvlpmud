    This is a book for those who choose to SEE, for those who choose
to follow the path I have chosen.  I do not expect many to follow
nor do I see a way for many to do so- for the path I have choosen is
a path filled with peril.  But he who does follow, shall find that 
everything is before him and all shall tremble before him.  Neither
the things in the light nor the things in the dark shall ever harm 
him, for he will have all to command.  Do not read this lightly nor
assume that you know all that is to know, for even I am still 
learning.
    Upon my early years of life, many toyed with 'magic'.  These 
people were 'magicians'- classed into two ranks: The Adepts and the 
Sorcerors.  The Adepts were those who had the talent to weave the 
'fae', the Sorcerors needed the rituals.  All molded the 'fae' for 
their uses. Yet many were blind to what they had.  For many assumed
that the 'fae' simply were the flow of the forces that they used,
that they 'tapped' into the rivers of 'fae' that flowed around them 
and drank the pools of 'fae' within them.  They were blind- the 
fools.  Many died in torment as the 'fae' they had so eagerly 
embraced burned through them.
