messages "NEW CHANGES(Roland the Hunter Ranger):**If you haven't already noticed, the guild has been changed.Right now there are only basic skills and fighting stats for everyone, until more functions are coded.Please use the things you have and advance as you wish.type "skills" and "ranger skills" for some more info.I will post more details as they become available.Please let me know if you encounter any errors with specific information.ThanksRoland/Beck**Choosing Weapon and Animal names(Jazz the Silver Test Ranger):**You can now choose your weapon and zord name inside the command center.Use the 'Weapon' command to choose the weapon name.Likewise use 'Animal' for the zord name.Jazz/Beck**New Guilds(Ghost the Transparent Ranger):**As stated when you were recruited, and in the Ranger conduct.We are a 'good' guild.  Any guild based on evil (cyberninja,dark order) we should not associate with at all.  If you have"friends" in those guilds then they will understand the roleyou are playing on this mud as a Power Ranger.  BCM's are upto your own decision though they are not to become allies asspecifically noted by Beck.  Personal 'alliances' and the likethat have no effect on our Team I have no problem with at all.Any other ?'s write em on the globe 8)**Personal issues(Jazz the Silver Test Ranger):**I hope that people can keep personal issues and attacks off the mud, but it appears some people can't.  For cases where allies are disrupting things, or can't seem to role play and separate real life from Nirvana, there is a banish command.I trust your judgement, so use it if you really need to.  If you are unsure, or not able to use the command, mail Beck to take care of it.The current allies causing problems have been banished meaning they can't be allies or rangers.Jazz/Beck**Issues response.(Jazz the Silver Test Ranger):**Recruiting:  If you guys are complaining about not having enough recruiters, suck up the skill points yourself.  Roll some from combat over to leadership so you can do it yourself.  The ball is in your court.  Don't rag on the people who actually thought about more than their mob killing skills.Healers:It came to my attention that a healer was participating in killing our NPC's through indirect means.  The healer issue has come up several times in the past.For a healer to role-play correctly they must heal regardless of background.  For a ranger to role-play, he must not associate with evil or their helpers.Its a tough role, because while people are very good at heart, there is a role-playing conflict.I just threw out the bit about no longer allowing recruiting for healers.  Apparently there is some erruption, but never has anyone addressed either side with me.Keep in mind #1 if any of our allies were to attack a ranger NPC directly it automatically strips them of ally status.#2 our ally channel is a powerful but open tool.  I expect you guys to manage it, but some things could be at risk (from a role-playing perspective).#3 Its still just a chat channel.  By not allowing certain people as allies only means they arent on the channel, not that they can't play with you etc.Since I haven't heard much from either side (until I threw something out there on purpose to get a response...Im smarter than I look), I will leave it as is.  If I hear much more on this though I will take some action of my own doing, unless I hear some pro-active discussion.Overall guild quality/play:Im a little concerned about Coopers statement about the guild being poor at the moment.  Is this the personel, the skills, etc.?What does everyone think?  I really strived for a self-sufficient guild where I don't have to be involved for it to run.  Am I making a poor assumption that it can run without me?Forgive me that I dont have a lot of time here.  I got layed off, I have a one year old sun, and am enjoying much higher tech role playing games.If I am needed though, I am here and I will fix things.  I just need to know.If you have any issues make sure you mail Beck, and ONLY Beck.ThanksBeck/Jazz**Note Consolidation New Recruits(Sundin the Brandy Ranger):**The note is titled 'New recruits(Kezef the Sand Ranger)':Ok people this is Team center guild its not for one person to recruit a ranger its a job for everyone.  I've been a ranger for some where bordering on forever and i still don't remember what every ranger teaches.  The recruiters job is to get the ranger started after that if a new recruits have a problem (like he can't remember who teaches weapon) he has the guild channe to ask or god forbid go looking for the ranger and see for himself.For New Rangers - READ THE HELP FILES thats what they do is help.  If you have a question ask.  If your having trouble fight ask if some has time for a party.

Thereis a lot of new information scatter around through them as to whatchanges have been made within the guild. [morph, combat, ninja, zord,unmorph, et cetra]Second, Fred says that several of the changes have been rather 'behindthe scenes' as it were and may not be necessarily visible in combat orregular game play. These were the work of Vital and some others whowanted to make sure the Power Rangers continued on into the future asa viable choice.Third, most all of the updates are finished and finalized and I havebeen assured that we shouldn't be facing any additional issues. If youhave any issues crop up, feel free to send a mail or file a bugreport. If you file a bug report, it will help track it down if youtype 'bug [communicator] bug_message_here'. Note the square brackets,as that will ensure that the bug message will be attached to yourguild object!Fourth, thanks for continuing to make this a great guild to play in.It was, is and always will be a guild centered around role playing andpositive examples of that will be rewarded [negative ones... well,let's not think about that]. As more of you are active, the power[which now is maxed at 17250] will be more of an issue and willrequire more attention than when only 2 or 3 Rangers play.**some coin areas(Rick the Coffee Ranger):**Here are some areas for coins.note some of these area are pk, i will put an * next to these.*Ninjas - In the wasteland, green, 5e, 3n, w, kill the ninjasQurds green, 4w,3n,enter crystal,n,w,s,s,e wander around, some of em moveFerrets - 6w,3s,4w,all s, all w, all n, 2e (i think) enter hole, forest3w (i think), 3s, se, search for cave, and if you climb in the cave..wellyou'll find out ;).Xetra - 5e,5n,take crystal, explore, beware tho down is dangerousOoze - green, 5e, 3n, enter tree, n, 3w, cross, cross_west, w, splace hand in carving, this area is based on your alignment goingin, so go in good to get evil mobs.Pyramid - also in the tree, just go all s from the entrance, lookfor a lever to pull to activate the statues.Ants - 6w, 3s, 4w,3s, enter hall, 2n, explore.for the most part these mobs are all evil.Hopefully this will help some newer players.Rick  -- around for some reason tonight.**Files of Interest(Sephiroth the Darkest Ranger):**Please read and keep in mind these two specific help files:ranger conduct', and 'ranger recruitThese are written rules and are there for a reason. Please read them carefullyand remember them well.Be well fellow Rangers,Seph, The Darkest Bastard**Notice(Fred the Rubik's Cube TempRanger):**I'm stepping in as the gwiz for the time being.  It's beena long time coming I figure but whatever works.  I willposting several things probably in the coming week.Some will be updates, some will be new rules, some will bere-enforcing existing rules.  I like this guild and it's beenawhile since I've liked where it's going.  So even if youthink all wizes are <explitives>, I do also have a Rangerchar.So far the only change is that players can no longer remove ANYnotes from the Viewing Globe including their own.Frep, the Rubik's Cube TempRanger.**Recruitment Consolidation(Fred the Rubik's Cube TempRanger):**I'm consolidating two notes as far as recruitment goes.Any new recruit should be noted on the bglobeso people have a chance to voice opinions.Same goes with new allies.they should be left on for a week before being recruited.  thanks to some you'll notice that any new posts will include a date time stamp.Fred[Oct  4 2007 15:25]**Heals(Fenris the Spam Ranger):**Just a suggestion for the guild, when you buy tons of heals and then when youare finished fighting, why not leave them in the command center, I am surethere are more then a few of the smaller rangers who would appreciatethat gesture, it would also help those that are in a bind for coins andcould use some help if none of us are around.  I do not have any troublecoining myself but I do remember how it was when I was much smaller in levels.  Just consider this Rangers.-Fenris[Oct  7 2007 14:14]**what the you know what(Fred the Rubik's Cube TempRanger):**Are the 2 to 3 rules that I posted really that hardto understand?  I said all new recruits Rangers and Allysshould be posted on the board for a WEEK so everyonehas a chance to comment or talk to the individual. Oneweek isn't that long.  Considering it'll take the personlike 3 years to max if they ever actually do I don'tthink it's an unreasonable request.If you are one that thinks they should join when their week is up, that is fine, go ahead and help them.They can build up exp so when they are finally recruitedthey will have a good start within the guild.Yes, I read that they talked to the 'active' players andfrankly I'm getting a little tired of this 'active' and'not active' stuff.  Some people are busier IRL thanothers and might only make it once a week, maybe everyother week.  They are still part of this guild andtheir opinions should be considered.With that said I'm done commenting about it.  The nextperson that feels that they don't have to follow thesewhat should be simple rules will either be removed fromthe guild, or at a minimum will have I don't know maybeeach training area cut in half.  Example you got 100 morph100 combat, 20 weapon, 10 armor etc.  You'll be reduced to50, 50, 10, and 5 respectively.Fred[Oct 19 2007 09:28]**Re: Skill Point Transfer(Fred the Rubik's Cube TempRanger):**There is a new command for this so that you don't haveto always ask a wizard to do it.Example:  rpt 4 fredCause you like me and I need more skill points :)See 'ranger rpt' for more info.Fred[Dec 20 2007 22:25]**Some more Directions for new rangers(Kyrie the Black Death Ranger):**I notice that there isn't directions to Evil Soup N so if you need them i have posted below themESN-W,W,W,W,All Nw,N,W,W,Shop-Kyire The Black Death Ranger-[Aug 15 2011 19:07]**Re:25(Fred the Rubik's Cube TempRanger):**Actually from the green the directions are:w,w,w,w,n,nw,nw,nw,nw,n,w,w,shop.Fred[Sep  6 2011 15:06]**New Recruits, and their Recruiters(Skarekrow the Vermilion Ranger):**If someone could remove the previous note of the same title, please do -_-Anyway, for someone looking to join the guild, a few things are advisable:1) Level 10+2) Strength, Stamina, Luck, Stealth, Dexterity, and Magic Aptitude all as high as they can be for the level they are3) At least 1 million free exp upon joining.... the more, the better.This is being posted for a reason. Type 'finger jayden'. New recruit, but at under 6 hours age, and just level 5,it's not likely he has much, if any in stats or free exp when he joined, meaning his road as a new rangeris going to be much more difficult, long, and painstaking than that of someone who joined at level 10with higher stats and plenty of free experience to dump into skills upon joining. It's be no means anysort of requirement, but if we want rangers who aren't going to give up at the start and collect dust inthe roster, just filling spaces that could be used by someone who would be more active and have a mucheasier time getting up to a viable combat readiness. Even a level 5, with stats at 15 and a good bit ofguild exp put into points can be a very good soloist, I was living proof of that. A level 5 with a bitof points already into the guild, and decent stats, can fight about as well as any 19+, of course with theexception of carry limit, HP cap, and tox levels. Just please take this into advisement for any furtherrecruiting that is done from here on. If you feel THAT deeply they are a good candidate to join us,you should have no issues helping them get ready for joining by guiding them through these things, helpingthem allocate their beginning points to get the starting abilities they will need from each skill,helping them build that starting exp and stats, and of course, point them to some of the more importantnotes at the beginning of the list on this globe board. Thanks all for hearing me out on this. Any questions,feel free to mail me or post a reply (if it is of significance to be posted on the board, elseways just mailme). Hope to keep seeing you all around more, it's fun having more rangers to play with.Skarekrow, the Vermilion Ranger[Feb 15 2013 10:35]**Guild Behavior(Fred the Rubik's Cube TempRanger):**I have removed the notes on this board that just slam andpoint fingers at other guild members.  That will notbe tollerated in this guild.  If you have a problemwith a guild member come to me about it.Mail me, text me, find me on Facebookk, whatever you want todo, but it doesn't get put on a guild board.  It also willnot be on public channels.  It just makes the whole guild look bad.This guild is built on teamwork, not calling peoplenames over public channels.  If thissort of behavior continues, those people will be removedfrom this guild.  I don't care if you guys don't likeeach other or get along.  I don't expect everyoneon here to be best friends forever or any ofthat junk.  I do expect you all to act like adultsthough and not 14 year old kids.  I apologize to any 14 yearold kids that might be playing.Fred[Dec 16 2013 10:17]**alaryck(Blazko the Onyx Ranger):**alaryck would like to join us, i have spoken with him an gave him the task of finding our command center, he sees much evil an wants to join us to help us be rid of it, i also told him that a guild leader may have yet another task for him, and that he has to wait for 1 week, he has agreed to both terms, the task of finging the center was just to put him on the board, but anyways, plz chat with him an put feedback here or mail me, thnx[Feb 10 2014 14:09]**pking fellow rangers(Xerxes the Rain Forest Ranger):**Theres been some issues lately with rangers accidentally killing one another in a group...its believed at this time that zords are the reason so if your in a group and enter a pk area it is STRONGLY suggested that you release your zords.

Speak now or forever hold your peace.- We can look into letting Three join, I know nothing about him thoughcause I don't see him online much. Thus I can't put my personaly stampof approval on him yet.- Malt, you should seriously look into reassigning your points inLeadership to a skill more useful to a newer Ranger. That being Combat,Morph, Machine, Armor, Weapon, or really ANY other skill. heh. Usuallypeople will put in MAYBE 5 into Leadership for retrain, but it is bestto get yourself trained and strong before trying to get others trainedand strong. They are your points to spend, but that is my advice.- Brak[Aug  7 2016 11:57]**Newbie Rangers Might Need to Relog(Tank the Malachite Ranger):**Hi everyone, thanks for letting me be part of this awesome guild!
