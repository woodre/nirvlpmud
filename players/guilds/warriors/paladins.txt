[OVERVIEW]
The Paladin Profession is an add-on to the Warriors.  This means that new
skills and abilities, as well as drawbacks, are acquired by choosing
this field.  
A Paladin is a holy warrior that draws from both the physical and magical
side of skills.  It is truly the only 'mystical' type of profession
available.

[DRAWBACKS]
As with all profession add-ons, the Paladin's special powers run on an
endurance level.  The endurance level will drop in combat as special
powers are used.  When this reaches a low level, the Paladin becomes
less effective, and sometimes cannot perform their skills.

Paladins have the drawback of having their coins max at 50k.  Once
their coins reach over this, they are dested.

Paladins also have the drawback of having to choose an alignment and
staying within those guidelines in order to use their powers.  If
they choose good, for instance, and their alignment falls to 40 or
less, all paladin powers cease to work.  Also, some powers are based
on alignment choice and are not available to both sides.

Paladins have 1 skill point less than any other profession because
they must spend a point in Holy studies, in order to take on the
more mystical skills they can have.

[SKILLS]
Each skill has a max level of 5, except a few skills which require
only 1 point to have.  A Paladin will have 20 points to spend; 18 total
but they must spend 1 point in order to choose from paladin skills,
and another point in Holy studies in order to choose anything more 
than weapon skills.

[ADVANCEMENT]
Monks advance the same as Warriors, by converting over xp.  Each level costs
500k xp, with 16 additional levels for the add-ons.  Raising skills is done
by visiting the guild hall and going to the Book of Monks.  Each time a level
is earned, 1 skill point is given that they can spend on skills.
