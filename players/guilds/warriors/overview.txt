OVERVIEW:

The Warrior Profession is a simple idea based on the fact that 
almost every guild is stuck with loyalties that every players
can't even begin to stand.  The Warrior's are not a guild, but
instead a job(or profession) that the player becomes.  As with
any job, it isn't who you are, instead it is what you do. Who
you are is decided by the player.  A Warrior can be good, evil,
neutral, religious, aetheist, warlike, peaceful, helpful, 
harmful, the list goes on and on.  

LEVEL STRUCTURE:

There are 40 glvls within the Warrior class, totalling at just
over 4.6 million to max.  Each level will provide the player
with a skill point to spend.

SKILL STRUCTURE:

There are 21 skills in the Warrior profession.  6 Weapon type,
8 attack moves, 4 defense, and 3 miscellaneous.  The number of
levels per skill is varying, for instance you might be able to
raise edged weapons to 10, while firstaid only raises to a max
of 5.  Each level a skill point is gained, and can then be spent
to either start a skill or add to a current skill.  
The skills, after the 1st level, must be used in order to be
raised.  In other words, if I raise edged weapon to 1, and then
use nothing but blunt weapons, then I will not be able to raise
edged until I use it several times.  This skill-usage tier will
go up as the skill does, requiring 2000-4000 uses at best.   
Of course, as you add to a skill it becomes more powerful, or
raises its potential.  
Perspective: There are 21 skills, with a total of 128 skill points
available.  At 40th glvl a warrior will have 40 pts to spend,
equaling up to less than one-third their potential. There is one
exception to this rules, which will be noted below.

SKILLS:

6 Weapon Skills:
Weapon skills have a range of 10 skill lvls available.
edged       - Sword and axe
blunt       - mace, club, stick, etc
polearm     - trident, lance, etc.
small       - dagger, knife, etc.
exotic      - whips, chains, your usual BDSM
archery     - bows, guns, etc.

Weapon skills are charted by taking skill lvl * random(10) and
then comparing it on a chart:
Range:       Bonus to WC:
95 to 100:   wep_bonus += 20
85 to 94:    wep_bonus += 12        
70 to 84:    wep_bonus += 10        
50 to 69:    wep_bonus += 7         
35 to 49:    wep_bonus += 4         
25 to 34:    wep_bonus += 3         
20 to 24:    wep_bonus += 2         
10 to 19:    wep_bonus += 1         
5  to 9:     wep_bonus += random(2) 
1  to 4:     wep_bonus += 0 
This shows that it is harder to get bonuses even
when maxed at level 10 in a weapon.
