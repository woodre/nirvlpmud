[OVERVIEW]
The Monk Profession is an add-on to the Warriors.  This means that new
skills and abilities, as well as drawbacks, are acquired by choosing
this field.  
A Monk is a disciplined fighter that specializes in hand to hand combat
and the use of the mind as a weapon. 

[DRAWBACKS]
As with all profession add-ons, the Monk's special powers run on an
endurance level.  The endurance level will drop in combat as special
powers are used.  When this reaches a low level, the monk becomes
less effective, and sometimes cannot perform their skills.

Monks are also restricted by the weight of the armor that they wear.
The maximum weight for each piece of armor is 1.  Since most armor
has a weight of 2 or higher, this can affect their performance. Also,
a few of their more common powers are decreased in ability the higher
the total weight of the monk is.

[SKILLS]
Each skill has a max level of 5, except disciplines, which require
only 1 point to have.  A Monk will have 15 points to spend; 16 total
but they must spend 1 point in order to choose from monk skills.

Hand-to-Hand  -  The wc of this is based on the current endurance
                 of the Monk.  At 90% or higher, the monk will have
                 an effective base wc of 16 + random(hand to hand skill*2)
                 Effective wc is 13 + random(h2h skill * 2) if endurance
                 is at 20% or higher.  5 + random(h2h skill) otherwise.
                 At 40% endurance or higher, additional attack moves will
                 go off, offering a bonus of between 1 - 15 to wc.

Touch         -  Works in combination with the H2H skill.  Touch will
                 lower either AC or WC of the opponent.  It can be
                 toggled on or off, and uses 3 endurance per strike.
                 There is a random 0 - 25 vs. Attackers level + 1/3 of
                 attackers level chance of going off and reducing by
                 1.

Advanced Dodge - Gives a second chance of dodging.  Works same as original
                 Dodge.
 
Advanced Blunt - Adds to original blunt skill, giving higher chance for the
                 larger wc bonus.

Advanced Polearm - Same as blunt.

Discipline of Time - Allows for a bonus of 1 endurance pt per round during 
                     meditation.
Discipline of Blood - Allows the monk to use xpunch and xkick even when they do
                      not have enough sps to cast.  Instead, it drains it from
                      hps.  Must have at least 1 sps though.
Discipline of Mind - 15% chance of faster sp regen each round, giving 1 point.

xpunch -  Skill lvl        1        2        3           4         5
          Damage         r(16)+8  r(18)+9  r(20)+10   r(22)+11  r(24)+12   
          Cost             16        18        20         22       24
          Bonus damage = ac + weight of worn ring.  (max weight of 1!)

xkick  -  Same as Punch, just different visually.

Meditation -  if(random(10) < meditation skill lvl(max 5))  + 1 endurance and +1 
              heal self.  If meditation = 5th level, will randomly receive the
              short() location of players in the game, even if invis.  Drawback:
              requires 3 rounds to come out of meditation, and cannot do ANYTHING
              while meditating.  If attacked, meditation will end in 3 rounds.

[ADVANCEMENT]
Monks advance the same as Warriors, by converting over xp.  Each level costs
500k xp, with 16 additional levels for the add-ons.  Raising skills is done
by visiting the guild hall and going to the Book of Monks.  Each time a level
is earned, 1 skill point is given that they can spend on skills.
