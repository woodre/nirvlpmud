The path of the Monk is one of meditation, bodily control, and the
ability to fight barefisted and destroy most enemies.  The monk
shuns the use of most armors, and even some weapons, instead 
relying on the potential of the body.  As a priest, the Monk delves
into the mystical arts of the gods, and has become more powerful
for it. 
The following is a listing of skills that will assist a warrior
wanting to follow the path of the Monk:
1) blunt - Blunt weapons are one type of weapon that could be
           very beneficial to a Monk.
2) punch/kick - Two powers that will assist a wannabe Monk in
                their future endeavors.
3) dodge - With so little protection, this skill is a necessity
           for the Monk.
4) run - Stealth is what the Monk requires, and running is that
         important first step.
