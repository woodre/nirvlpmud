The process of joining the Warriors is simple and straightforward.
This is a school, and as with most schools you must enroll in
order to join.  The enrollment fee is 50,000 coins, a steep price
but worth it in the end.  You must also be at least 5th level,
which proves that you have some minor experience in the world.

To join, go upstairs to the Master of the Towers office.  There
you can speak with him about it.  If you have any questions on
what will be taught, consult this library.

                    - Good Luck -
