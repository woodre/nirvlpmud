The Assassin is a mastermind of stealth and the quick kill. Although
not the strongest of the Warrior paths, it is perhaps still the 
deadliest in its abilities.  An Assassin prefers the advantages of
it's abilities in awkward situations; the darkness, confusion of
combat, and surprise.  Although it is unlikely an Assassin will be
good in nature, considering that killing is their first goal, it
is still possible - although acceptance of someone so bent on the
death of others will be hard to swallow.
As a Warrior wanting to walk in the path of the Assassin, it is
beneficial to have the following or even necessary sometimes to
have the following skills:
1) small  - Daggers are the preferred weapon of the assassin, followed
            by edged.
2) offhand/parry - Necessary for the the assassin that requires some
            defense.
3) strike/throw - Either will assist.
 
4) blindfight - a wonderful tool for the darkness that can be expanded
            on.
5) run - A quick escape that will add to future rewards.

6) Pummel - helpful, and expandable with the Assassin.
