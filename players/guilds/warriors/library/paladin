The path of the Paladin is that of a holy warrior that wields both
magic and physical abilities to help their friends or harm their 
enemies. Everything they do is meant to further the cause of their 
god.  Remember, a god can be evil or good, making the Paladin able
to serve any alignment.  A Paladin is an invaluable ally on the
field of battle with their powers of healing and fine abilities in
weapons.
The following is a list of skills that will be beneficial to the
Paladin path:
1) Any Weapons - As a warrior weapon skills can be expanded on and
                 used.  Archery is not used by Paladins.
2) firstaid - The beginnings of heal powers that will be vastly
              expanded.
