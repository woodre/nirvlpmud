An Assassin is a warrior that uses stealth to combat
their foes.  They infiltrate where others are unable
to go, moving with great stealth to surprise the
unwary.  Although not defensive, an Assassin is one
of the most powerful offensive warriors.

An Assassin falls under the same rules as the Warrior:
                      None

I hope that you can find a suitable personality for
an Assassin and roleplay it well.  Good luck!
