The Assassins are subject to the following drawbacks:

1)  An Assassin is a pker.  Therefore you must always have
    pk set in order to use your assassin skills.

2)  An Assassin must be ready to move quickly, and this means
    moving lightly.  No heavy armors.  Also, those shields
    and helmets are worthless for Assassins.
