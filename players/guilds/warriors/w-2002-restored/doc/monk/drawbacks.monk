The Monks are dedicated to relying on their own bodies
speed and abilities, and therefore, do not wear heavy
armor.  They not only don't wear heavy armor, they CANNOT
wear heavy armor.  

Monks are also an advanced profession, and therefore draw
on more energy to fight than the normal Warriors. Because
of this they draw on deeper reserves of endurance than 
most. Please read 'monk endurance' for more information.

Good luck.
