By using 'title', you can make your own color
title.
Here is how:

Examples:
1] You type:
[1;37m"[2;37;0mtitle $R$the Warrior$N$ [1;37m"[2;37;0m and get:
[2;37;0m [2;37;0m [31mthe Warrior[2;37;0m 

     Colors must always be in the syntax: $<color>$

Valid colors:
 [35mM[2;37;0m = Magenta  [30mK[2;37;0m = blacK  [36mC[2;37;0m = Cyan  [32mG[2;37;0m = Green
 [33mY[2;37;0m = Yellow   [37mW[2;37;0m = White  [31mR[2;37;0m = Red   [34mB[2;37;0m = Blue
Note:  [1mH[2;37;0m will make the color Bold and N is used to
       reset the color scheme if you should need to (see examples)

This ability is acquired at Profession level 30.

NOTE:  Your title must keep within some semblance of what you present
yourself as.  For instance, "the Samurai", "the Bounty Hunter", 
"[Monk]", etc.  Do NOT test my patience on this.  And if a wizard
says that your title is inappropriate, change it.  This is an
ability that is not to be taken for granted, as it has never
existed in such a way before.   - Maledicta
