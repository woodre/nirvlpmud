messages "Changes & Updates [vital] (May 26, 2007):**[From the desk of Vital]I'm trying to make some changes to allow the guild to be a little morecompetitive in the global arena. Rather I mean I want to see more ofthe Family on and enjoying themselves, so I'm making some incrementalchanges to help to that end.The first change is that the wolves are now available from around theworld. Well, that's not entirely true, they can be "called" anywherein Nirvana. They are still just the same old wolves.The second change is that the wolves called at the wolf rock are slightlybetter at being wolves than those called anywhere else.The third change is that the wolves can be used in... well I'll leave thatas an exercise in surprise and fun for some.Thanks - report any problems for free goodies.--Vital**[Brittany] & [vital] (May 26, 2007):**Just a quick note to let you all know that Brittany and Vital are goingto be putting some changes into the guild to make it more effective andappropriate for the ever changing mud around us. If you have some ideasor concerns that you would like to share with us feel free to give themto us via mail or on the fly.--Vital**Progress Update [vital] (Jun  1, 2007):**This is to keep you informed as to what is going on behind the scenes so thatyou don't think we're just sitting around giving lip-service to updating theFamily. There are a lot of things to do and we want to give you the best pos-sible guild experience, bar none.1.  The whole guild code is being moved to a general location. This will allow    for easier collaboration by myself and other guild wizards.2.  Most of the guild code is being reviewed and in many cases rewritten for    speed and more important, clarity.3.  The new guild object has been finished and is under going testing. As soon    as it is ready, the Family's spells and abilities will soon follow.4.  The Family's help files are being reworked and expanded to encompass all    of the changes being implemented as well as to increase thematic     considerations.Thank you for bearing with us and keep your suggestions coming.--Vital & Brittany**Guild Object Progress [vital] (Jun  3, 2007):**The guild object has been completely reworked so that it is much moreflexible than before. It is being debugged now and should be ready forthe next phase, which is to actually give it some abilities [skills/spells] as is necessary to test it out. It's not ready for prime time by anystretch of the imagination, but when it is I will be posting that as well.There are also some intruiging changes that are slated for introduction inthis newest of incarnations.--Brittany & Vital**More Information [vital] (Jun  9, 2007):**I'm sorry I haven't posted any information in a couple of days. It'sbeen hectic with a hurricane blowing through, complicated by the factthat it's the first one in recorded history for this place.On the guild update front, we've got the guild object completely re-coded to be more streamlined and future-friendly. The next step is toget some of the skills/abilities updated to use the new guild objectand act correctly. When we get to this point, we'll need some of theFamily to step up and put them to the test. [We'll let you know!]Finally, we're going to be making some subtle changes that will notreally be noticeable to the current guild object as a pre-cursor tothe overhaul. If you do see any reproducible oddity, let us know. Ifyou also have any thoughts about current abilities that you'd just assoon NOT come to the new object, let us know.Next post I'll try to put list some of new directions the Family willbe headed.Rest well dear Family,Vital**"
