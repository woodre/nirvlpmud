messages "Biting(berlinetta, Apr 25, 19):**Just thought i would post a note informing you allthat in addition to people needing to be at least lvl 5to bitten (lvl5->bite->death->lvl4) so that they can use thebasic guild commands after joining, you will also need to makesure that they have a strength of at least 16, maybe 17 in casethey lose the str stat to the biting death. Your strengthmust be at least 16 to be able to use the "drain" ability.So if somebody has a str of less than 16, they can't get the blood that they will need to power all their guild abilities.Also something to consider before biting is the int stat.To use the "assess" power requires a 12 int. While not as importantas the drain command, it is still something to take intoconsideration I think.As Always,          -B-**Alliances(magus, Oct 12, 2000):**If your alliance with any other person in any other guild interferes withany vampire family member, you better rethink it.  Family ALWAYS comes first.**pk power(sticks, Apr 16, 2005):**Ummm...take a look at what ya got guys.1. levitate...a very powerful escape trick.2.  demon spell...as powerful as is legal...bar none.3.  vamp heals right outside the guild hall...(almost illegal)4.  some very nice pk spells and guild abilities...5.  a wolf which is one HELL of a powerful guild pet6.  a wolf pet that works in conjunction with a mud pet 7.  a heal spell (unlimited and it will spam) for pk...8.  a guild hall that is totally safe from pk...9.  a weapon class bonus (nobody else has this) 10.  lots of cool spells (almost all of them) for mud play.I do agree...we do not seem to hit hard in pk...but many guilds are overpowered.  If two vampires wereto hunt in pk together, they would be deadly.I will lend my blade to yours anytime...but Iseem to be about the only pk vamp around...???I'd love to have some help...and share the fun!                     Sticks the Elder Vampire (still kicking)**Coffin storage(eurale, May 25, 2005):**The problem is not with the coffin storage but with the coffin storers.When you store somethink with 'store knife 2' and months later come backand try to retrieve it with 'retrieve knife' it will not work.  You needthe same syntax you used to store it to retrieve it.  When you forget,that means going into the file to see just exactly what you called yourprized possession when you stored it.  If you try all the possibilitiesand still can't get it out, mail me with the item name and I'll try tolook it up.  (Nice typos huh?)**Blood/Pets/Misc(eurale, Jul  2, 2005):**Your blood energy level is available on you 'sc' screen so all one has todo is look at it.  I was designed to be 'less than totally accurate'.  Petscan be monitored as per Sticks note pretty easily.  Lastly, I better notfind anyone biting a new app without waiting the appropriate time or they'llalso be looking for a guild to join.  Don't think this isn't being monitoredas you'll be wrong.**hi family(charrise, Mar 18, 2006):**Just wanted to take a           a few minutes to say hello...miss the family more than words can express...hope to be around a little more often than the past six years...hehluv ya all...Charrise**more storage?(saphira, Sep 27, 2006):**I was wondering if we could possible have more storage?Some us may not have enough coins to get into our room andat least with coffin storage we can use what we have in there.I thought maybe having 5 spaces would be good. It is justa suggestion.Your lil vamp sisterSaphira**idea(saphira, May 16, 2006):**Lately there has not been a lot of us on, but I still love this guildI think we need some new powers and stuff. maybe just a complete overhaul.I think if we offered more for other people we might have more vamps on here.I don't this is just a thought!Well I hope everyone is well. May the Darkness guide youThe youngest childerSaphira**The Return(treebeard, Jun  5, 2006):**My Family,  After a long (far too long) absence, I have returned to you,my first and still most favorite family.  To those that rememberme, I miss you truely.  To those who came after, I greet you withall that is left of my heart.  Stay true!  With Reverence,     Treebeard**remedy(hottentot, Jun 12, 2006):**What in the heck?Saphira did you happen to turn your brain OFF before you bit remedy?Pardon my rather rude start, but why would we bite someone withoutso much as a note on the board? One of the things we done for a longtime is to generate and pass information on to each other via thisboard. In the initial days of the Family when there were always 2 to3 vampires on, it was easier to discuss new applicants in person,but with only two or three vampires on per day, it is nigh on toimperative that we discuss applicants on the board. If someone bitesa prospective applicant, there is an implicit expectation that theother bites are coming, even if expressed otherwise.It's fine to feel like a given applicant should be inducted into theguild, but at least post that feeling before you decide to bite. Ifyou think it is necessary to bite someone before you post a note forpeople to discuss, at least post one after giving your rational. Thisis really the door through with all manner of problems get started.I haven't decided yea or nay, but don't like Remedy already having abite before I get a chance to talk to him more than a couple of smallsentences.Hottentot**remedy 2(hottentot, Jun 12, 2006):**I've talked with Remedy at length. I've done this a lot over theyears and I've come to conclusion that biting him into the Familywould be a bad move on our part.There is a strong self interest and only a cursory emphasis on thefamily and bringing unity, advancement and development to the waywe work.Other thoughts?Hottentot the Vampire Shining One**Crip(hottentot, Jun 12, 2006):**Can't recommend this one at all. Not even a bit. He's been in otherguilds, caused problems and generally shown a lack of discipline andteamwork. Mostly his desire revolves around self-improvement.Recap: No.Hottentot the Vampire Shining One**recent applicants(solitare, Jun 12, 2006):**call this old vampire xenophobic, but No no no no no!Their notes are sub-standard, lack of thought and theyhave nothing to offer us.  Biting them would be a complete waste of a bite.  I am disappointed thatanother family member would bite them and not evenconsider mentioning it at all on our board, thoughnot a hard rule it's considered considerate.The Loner - Solitare**biting and stuff(sticks, Jun 12, 2006):**Personally, my feeling is this guild should be a person'ssole purpose and end. Thus, I will NOT bite anyonewho has been in another guild prior to this one. Thats just my little 'rule'.As far as our guild goes, I have been, for the mostpart, the only one here most of the time. Its nice to see some others around...and as far as discussionon this board goes...well...see the first part of thissentence...its hard to have a discussion with one's self.**Applicants(tifa, Jun 15, 2006):**If someone posts an application, and says theyhave nothing to contribute to the family, whyshould they be bitten? I don't care if you knowthem irl. I know we can be picky. And I know that beingpicky means less members, but, if they aren'tquality people who are honest and have "something to contribute", why in the hell shouldANY of US bite THEM.Just My thoughts,   Tifa**Morrigan(tifa, Jun 17, 2006):**I was speechless for a few minutes. I'm not sure now, even, how to put what I am thinking into words.Wow, came to mind.   I like HER.Can I keep her?Your sister,    Tifa**"
