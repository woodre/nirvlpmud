<title>'The Fairies', by Allingham, Star's Song
They stole little Josanna,
  For seven years long,
And when she came down again
  Her friends were all gone.

They took her lightly back,
  Between the night an morrow,
They thought that she was fast asleep,
  But she was dead with sorrow.

They have kept here ever since
  Deep within the lake,
On a bed of flag-leave,
  Watching till she wake.
