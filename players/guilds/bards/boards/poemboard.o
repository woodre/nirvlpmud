tmp_text "Friend of my youthI have betrayed you.Shelter for my afternoons,Sharer of my secret thoughtsI have sacrificed our carefully shared communionsTo the common lords of hunger and cold.Dryad-like I hid among your leaves And sang with you in the spring.Tasting your fruit I wanted moreI stripped you of your heart - for love of having you.I wear your bones around my lifeI suffer with their aging.Strong limbs that held my weight are given to the fireTo protect my frailty.I cannot silence your beauty.Even in death your song resoundsBeneath my sullen feetAnd the wood rings true.**Most people come here to escape from realityTo fighting villiansTo becoming oneTo healing the woundedor just to sing a songAll in all this is a pleasurable place for all to endureNo matter your taste.**As darkness comes laying his hands upon us:The wind dances through the air, as the darkness just stares.Trees glide in the wind as it dances through it's branches.Bright, green grass snuggles up to the trees to gather warmth.As the trees reach out to the shining sun as it rises in the distance.The sun shines across the chilling dew that lays upon the grass.Darkness hides it's head as the sun raises bright in the morning sky.**Once in a lifetime you find That one special person thatYou think is just not the rightOne for you. Then you realize onceYou dont have that person that they Were the one for you. Telling someone you were wrong is neverEasy but as time goes by manyThings change you go your wayAnd they go theirs. Then You hope that your roads will cross somewhere Down the never ending road of--L--I--F--E--**Today as we stoodsurrounded by othersthe world didnt matterour hearts didnt stutter..You reached for my handopened it wideinto it you placedyour bleeding heart next to mine.I wasnt quite surejust how to reactwhen the first tear felli knew it was fact..this heart that I holdis very dear to meI'll protect it and love itand make it complete.as I thought about it moreand thought about you tooi knew there was somethingi longed to do..so give me your handhold it out carefullymy bleeding heartto you I give..please treat it gently.**The night I sangThe night I dancedThe night I may have forgotten all that I amThis one time lonelyThis one time vainThis one time I tried and all went insaneI am who I amI am but a dreamBut this one night, I had to screamI lost controlI lost my soulI lost the one thing I had to consoleMy voiceMy Voice!**I am differentYou hate meI am differentYou ridicule meI am differentYou ignore meI am a freakYou laugh at meI am a freakYou point at meI am a freakYou photograph meAnd all this becauseI am bigDon't you realise thatI am humanI deserve respectI am humanI deserve courtesyI am humanI deserve to be treated like itI have feelingsDon't trample themI have feelingsDon't crush themI have feelingsDon't hurt themPlease stop making me cry**I may seem small..delicate and frail..to others I'm strongin strength and will..but in all honestymy emotions are so..to say the least..like a glass window.You can see right through themno hiding them about..but with the wrong touch..they'll shatter into a massive amountof bits and pieces of love thats tornnever to recover, never to adore.I need to feel cared forloved and treasureda twinkle in your eyesthe jump in your stepthe reason to wakeand the reason to nap.To hold me by your sideto wake with me each dayto kiss me in the morningsand never go away.So maybe this poem will help youto know about who i am..just dont toy with my emotionsif you love me, then take my hand.Although my tears are falling and my heart is broken intoit doesnt mean I'm weakit means I'm becoming stronger too.I'll one day find the manwho will have such pride in meand he will then make you realizewhat you failed to see.For my heart is like an oceanits love never ends..but once you break it intoyoull never again get a chance.My love is undying and trueits there everytime you need itmy smile is always constantthat is just a given.My eyes sparkle when there is love in my heartand there is a jump in my stepand to everyone I meetthey'll know just how I felt. So when you are loved by mebe proud to be with mehold me by your sidetake me by the handfor no matter what others thinkyou'll be a lucky man.I'll treat you like a kingand take such good care of youand never give you a reasonto look for someone new.So take the time to learna little more about meI hope this poem has helpedfor me.. its set me free.**I sit alone in my room,I look around me and wonder,Why am I still here,Then I look in the bed next to me,At her blonde hair and blue eyes,We may fight, argue and fuss,And she may get older and move away,But she will always be my little girl.**Oh Bards, thy melodious voicetraveling througout the worldsinging and foretellingof heroes and deedsthe time has forgottenHeralds of the Realmsforced by an ancient pactfrom times immemorialto faced the fearfull cyberninjasfor their crimes they shall payOur eternal alliesThe valiant Templar KnightsAid as, as we do theyfor our destiny is to stand side by side on our last dayOh Bardic Guild of Ryllianthrough a time of inactivity we've passedThus noble Saber, to other places he leftWith extreme courage, our revered Ilarionthe house of our Guild has reopenedHail to the Bardic Guild!Hail to Nirvanalet this be our song of freedomfor it is time for us to write the futurelike our forefathers did before us.**Living in a dreamgrabbing life at the seemsone thread white the other blackshould i go forward or maybe turn backecho laughter madness tonesi guess i will pack it in and go homethe chairs are empty as my heartnoone there since we were torn aparthappiness feignedanother soul drained**    So scary     Are those three words     Words spoken in passion,     Spoken in a whisper.     At one precise moment     They feel so true     So right.     Some use them casually     In their everyday chatter,    But I find them sacred.     I can speak them only     When I'm certain.     I will not use them in vain.    They've been spoken to me before     Under the shroud of darkness     Beneath a warm touch,     But never before did they ring true.   Never before did they grab my heart     And caress it     With the magic     Of a pure soul.     Never before have they been sincere enough    To have my lips echo their syllables     In the most meaningful sentence     I could ever speak.     Those three words     Are only for you.**It is winter now and all the snow is fallingThe trees are bare and the wind blows coldThe Earth shudders 'neath her white blanketAnd the grey skies seem dark and oldA full moon at night leaves shadowsThe haggard trees a silhouette on snowThe winter's spirit howls in the distanceIts voice deep and low**In the earth it livesWith the power of ages it growsWith the strength of heart it lovesWith the beauty of color it breedsWith the fragrance of flowers it attractsBehold the power of nature.May it live forever.**Once embraced and confronted by the Lady,with the scabbard for the King I spoke gently,"For not in the tower of blood I see before me,if the Lady spoke true, Death must surely be behind me."I exercised braveness and set an example for all-But woe was upon me and I was to fell a great fall.The castle was shaded by a darkened night,though the voices of demons crept up through the light.Then shadows left and right scarcely stir,Turning towards the darkened form,the invisible knight/monster-The one who I had come for.I smote him a wound unlike the Heavens hath seen...He fell upon the floor wrapped up in his dreams,While I stood courageously and turned to my queen.The One, he spoke of cursed words of blazened hell.The king had fallen under a demon's evil spell.Fire and brimstone falling upon the lonesome murderer he urged,while the war he raged outside his own kingdom continued to surge.I thought, "I am not the murderer and must have my revengeupon the One for the loss of my vanished brother."I searched for a weapon and slew the mighty king...I won that battle, and for his champion I prepared for another.I found the golden spear and this you must know;My own dear brother Balan fell victim to that cursed blow.**Love, people say  What is love?Love is a delicate bond between two people.It is a bond that has to be treasured as if it wasAs precious as gold.Love is a basis for a marriage,It has many facets.It can be expressed in many differentWays and has to be built onto to survive.Love is the communication between special people.They communicate with words, touches, caresses,And with silent looks.This the way they mutually understand one another.Love can only be found through thrust.You have to be completely honest and give of yourselfOne to the other.Without all of this love cannot exist for you and youWill feel empty.**I have spoken.I have said my final word.I was torn,yet my voice was heard.My sword never betrayed me.Darkness has grasped my enemy.I have slain the gloom.I have reached my doom.**BooksBooks are fun, They are for everyone.Books give you knowledge, And can lead you thru college.A book is something you treasureThat you can keep foreverEveryone needs a book.**If I could have loved youIf I could have made you laughIf I could have made you happyBut alas this wasn't to be trueI couldn't love youI made you cryI didn't make you happyThis just makes me blue**life and death are one in the samealways beginning never endingdeath does come to those whom waitcold and sure, by the stroke of a sworddeath is a realm of eternal peace, which all may passboth have the power to make humans weepboth have the ability to bring peaceto me life is what we go to sleep to and wake to the inevitablelife and death are one in the samealways beginning never ending**I Do, Because I love YouI love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when i am with you.I love you not only for what you have made for yourself, but for what you are making me.I love you for the part of me that you bring out.I love you for passing over all my foolish and weak traits, that you can't help but see.I love you for drawing out into the light my beauty, which no one else had looked quite far enough to find.-- annoymous**With a breath we come to life.With a breath we lose what we gained.Living every moment for what its worth.Dealing with every adversity in its own right.We learn to live and to let go of those who cant hold on forever.It seems all life comes with strife and death around corners hiding and waiting.Living every day for the moment seems to be the only way to truly live.Living seems more important every day.Living means to survive when someone you love can no longer hold on.Living is being yourself for everyone around you.Living means even in death you find a happiness.**FAILURE -by Marlowe, 2005-07-02Looming...ahead...waitingSpring passes and yet you still wait...Forshadow.  Dread.  Cowering anticipation...You are here!  Now.  Climb.Higher you leap.  You grow before all...Towering...I strain...I push...I give in...I abandon...Unconquered, I fail...**This master beleives that it is well for any man to think upon himself as  a son of god, and as I beleive so it is. As the realm becomes jammed with those who seek my learning and touch from those who long only that the passing of my shadow might fall upon them, and change their lives. And so it was that I came into Ryllian and people following began to call me Messiah, and worker of miracles,and as they beleive it is so.**When you meet that perfect person the world stands still.The trees seem greener.The Sun seems brighter.The air seems cleaner.Your heart seems stronger.You become a person who feels the weight of the world isas light as a feather.The world seems yours for the taking.Nothing can stop you when you love that special person.**Deepest strengths pulling me through these wastes of this sick world. The thorns tearing my flesh as the blood flows onto the deep dark soil of torment.The rocks slicing my skin like a sharpe razor as i pull deeper and deeper searching for that hope that i might find what draws me forward w with each breath.Should i find the answer to wghat i seek or die into the soil and klet it take my soul into eternal suffering.~f**The thoughts of twisted memories flood my mind....The Depth of which my mind sinks into a deep hole as I slip further into the madness which consumes me....Forever looking for a solution to what is real or am I just dreaming....My body feeling so numb the taste of poison floods my mouth....Am I alive or am I dead for this i do not know....Forever I'm lost in madness to this world.**What does it mean to be brave?Think of all the people I saveI can run with the bestI can stand for the weakI can fight with the strongestAnd I'll fight for the meak.But I can't say I'll stayI get lost in my mindI just can't look her wayI seem to be blindWhen it comes down to her.What does it mean to be brave?To fullfill those feelings I craveBe it anger or desireThey stand just the sameThe fuel feeds the fireWhen you play in this game.If you can conquer oneThen who is to blameFor the actions you didn't doOr the weakness you claimWhen it comes down to her.When it comes to herI become totally lostWhen it comes to herI loose all of my mindAnd alone I stand once again.**The Echos of rational thinking rattle in my brain.Memories and fantasy driving me insaneDistant memories of childhood fadeas i sit in the evening shadeMy heart Sobs tears of greifmaybe its just pure releifMajor Issues in my mindof the people i left behindliving in a world of hateletting society berateshimmering memortiesunseen entitiesshouting in the dark reposeas i write these lines in prose**What if there were a poem that could save a life?would you write it?or would you let it fade from your mind,Never to be remembered again?What if there were a saying,What is said too often,Or has not meaning to that you can understand,That could change how you feel...Would you say it?If there was a piece of advice,that you think no one cares about,That could change the world,Or even a soul...Would you say it?or forget it forever?If there were a life that you are supposed to save,Only you can save,would you?If you were the only one that could save a love, would you?Or would you let it die?What would you do if you were the only one to save these kinds of things?Little or big, everything needs someone to save it,Everything has a meaning...Everyone has a meaning...So what if you were that someone.Would you?**To my daughterI was there the first dayI have dreams watching you  playMy only hope on this dayThat you come into this world the right wayMy love for you is realI can't help how I feelPlanning your future is so unrealThis first day brings me to tearsHolding you in my armsI won't let you goAt least not now until you growMy love you is so trueWith every step that you doI will watch you fight all harmIn my heart you have grownThrough time and years I will protectEvery day  you are awakeDaddy is me and to youIn my soul and heart is where you'llBe all ways anf trueI love you Mia and alway be true to you**Without a beginning or an endDarkness surroundingLost in a sea of nothing:Screaming in pain,But no one hearsTragic torture and pain;Bleeding within letting it floodWatching it seep down in the Earth's crust;No one notices and No one cares;I am lonely and without a voice;Lost in a void of nothingness;**Pushing away in a stuggle to find....Deep desires I've yet to find.... Anger and Hate Push Me To the Fine Line....Never to awake stuck in a never disappearing Lie.....Am I dead or am i alive......One thing left Just let me DIE!**Be patient with life, despite its cruelty.Often it seems careless of our pain,But just as often brings us hope again.Remember, I wanted hapipiness for you.Under every foolish word this still was true.Be happy, then, without, as you would with me.In your life many sweet events remain.Not in anguish, but in joy remember me.**True to oneself.Persevere with a tear in the eye.Fearless before Evil.True to oneself.Always a glimmer of courage.With a glean in eye that could never falter.A Knight.A human with endeavors and a dream.Should I fear?**Lovely lady of death,steals away my breath.With kisses that kill,or bewitches the will.Her limbs mock my bones,my squeezed heart moans.Her looks can destroy,the mind is but her toy.With her powerful gaze,men's heads raise.The look of lust,makes all life just....Oh Sweet lady of death.**Mathannech guren io anannAnnan ni u-pantRin lin u-fira sui aew pen-laerreniannen lond cuilSi ni adonnen.Amarth aderthaGuren linna uiNi pant.**I cry and weepAs u sink in deepTo the trouble your inThey tell me to abandon you, but I shall not For you are a friend that shall not be forgotYou are like a dad That I never really had or sawI will wait and wait for this trouble to thaw Like the winter ice that leaves the land bare and raw I will wait and wait the day you return to meIt shall bring me great glee And I know that you know thisYou dear friend of mine** The poetry flows from me, with a rhythm and a beat. Step twice towards the middle and wiggle your feet. Instead of asking why, I rather ask why not? Be thankful for all that you have, keep a hold of what you've got. A part of me insists that it has to be, the other insists its not. I never truly knew how to stand tall, until I actually gave it a shot.** My words can impress you, when used in different ways. No hands to caress you, though seductive within a phrase. Those red lips are burning, there's a fire in her eyes. Inside there's a young girl yearning, hidden by the glamour of her disguise.**Rhyming all reasons, reasoning all rhymes.There's no better way to pass the time.Time is here, time is now, I'd like to slow it down, thoughI'm unsure how. Time is slippery, time fades fast. How quickly today shallbecome our past. **Shrouded in mistIn a realm far awayIs a place where my heartLives still, to this dayLate into the eveningAlong the dark streetI find myself walkingAnd pray, love, we'll meetIn each empty buildingWindows dark and coldEcho with laughterAnd with voices of oldThey call out to meJoy traded for painThose I loved have moved onOnly ghosts now remainAs I pass by each placeWe once called our ownMy sighs echo softlyI am always aloneI'd give much to returnTo days long in the pastBefore tearful farewellsLove I thought would lastBut time marches onLife's street is one wayAnd I cannot recaptureEven one perfect dayExcept in my mindShrouded in mistWhere my love and my comradesIn our place existNow, I know in my heartThat where'er I roamWhen I close my eyesI have finally come home.**I met a lass with a curious routineshe gets dirty every time she gets cleanwhen she takes a bathshe enjoys every splashAnd at the end she looks quite serene**From the moment of my first step,I hat come to realize whai had found,It was a secret world that had been keptEagaerly my heart grew to acceptSo many people an strange placesIt filled my mind with amazing aweSo much knowledge, so many new facesFrom my clutterd mind did all worries fall.so many new and dangerous adventuresto keep my self entertainedSome may be villan,mant become my mentorshere is the place i shose to remain.**There is a place where the sidealk endsAnd before the street begins,And there the grass grows soft and whiet,And there the sun burns crimson bright,And there the moon-bird rests from his flightTo cool in the pepperming wind.Let us leave this place where the smoke blows blackAnd the dark street winds and bends.Past the pits where the asphalt flowers growWe shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,And watch where the chalk-white arrows goTo the place where the sidewalk ends.Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,For the children, they mark, and the children, they knowThe place where the sidewalk ends.  - Shel Silverstein**Shining deaths light in my eyes fighting my own, demise all the times that I have cried feel the pain deep inside all my scars I cannot hide seek the anwser I cannot find search my life for more timeCan this be my sign A Darkend hall that is my lifefind a answer without strife near the end, is it time leave my pain behindbroken windows in my mind erase the hate, I feel alivebroken shadows of my past Away from darkness free at last Feel my pain shatter like glass.Step away form my pastnow let me complete my final task release my pain remove the mask!**Although the land is darkbardic instruments are heardas well as the song of agesrequests are from all but mages**to slip into torment yet i fail again...another glimpse or another breath.....which will it be to prevail or die and fail....reaching for the glistening star....as i draw it close to reveal my true desiree...forever locked in eternal ecstacy in limbo....to the one i pull down in hope that returns.....life into my lungs and love to my heart...locked forever in eternal ecstacy.**Promise YourselfPoet: Julie Hebert,  2012 Of all the things you can do,Promise yourself you will try.If doesn't even matter if you win,As long as you apply.No one can ask of anything,Of you, except yourself.If you don't want to make a move,It's you who'll be left out.So don't allow yourself to miss,Out on important things.You may not feel that they are worthy,Yet turn out to be your wings.Experiences make us whole,And make life feel fulfilled.And when it's time to look back,Don't let yourself feel unskilled.So don't allow yourself to stop,For no apparent reason.Promise yourself you will try,And take on any season.**The stars dim at the sound of thy nameThy beauty outshines the sun.If had to walk across a thousand lands to gaze upon theeIt shall be worth the long journey my sweet muse that you might revel in the emotion of a hopeless dreamer.The nights passage is but a slice of death to be seperated from thy devine beauty. Let thy dreams be filled with comfort and warmth dream your deepest desires then face the morrow renewed upon your quest for them.For you my muse*Dramatic bow*~**"
