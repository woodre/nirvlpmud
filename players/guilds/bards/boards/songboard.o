new_head "Far From Home"
new_text "Far From home  by Five Finger Death PunchAnother day in this carnival of soulsAnother night settles in, as quickly as it goesThe memories are shadows; ink on the pageAnd I can't seem to find my way homeAnd it's almost likeYour heaven's trying everythingYour heaven's trying everythingTo keep me outAll the places I've been and things I've seenA million stories that made up a million shattered dreamsThe faces of people I'll never see againAnd I can't seem to find my way homeCause it's almost likeYour heaven's trying everythingTo break me downCause it's almost likeYour heaven's trying everythingTo keep me outCause it's almost likeYour heaven's trying everythingTo break me downCause it's almost likeYour heaven's trying everythingYour heaven's trying everythingTo break me downTo break me downTo break me downYour heavens trying everythingYour heavens trying everythingTo break me... down"

But I tried...How do you feel?What do you say?Where is my world?Living for today.Extinction happens every dayOne species at a time.God's creation blown away.To care my only crime(Chorus:)I never said it was easy.I never said it was free.I only said it would be worth it.If you follow me...IF you follow ME!How is your anger?How is your rage?Where are your morals?Living in a cage.The enemy is in your mind.A terrible thing to taste.Self Control is so hard to find.When Your life is such a waste.(Chorus)How is the deadly intrepid fearThat you have to live with.year after year.All we are is the dust of a Star.Shaped by the makers hand.He really is not so far.Dancing to a cosmic end...(chorus)How do you feel?If you met God today?What would you do?What would yo say?I gave up!...But I Tried!I gave up......But I tried...I gave up......but I tried...I gave up... But I tried.**Upon the darkened nightThe flame of love was burning in my breast.And by a lantern bright.I fled my house while all in quiet rest.Shrouded by the nightAnd by the secret stair I quickly fled.The veil concealed my eyes.While all within lay quiet as the dead.ChorusOh night thou was my guide.Oh night more loving than the rising sun.Oh night that joined the lover,To the beloved one.Transforming each of them into the other.Upon the misty night.In secrecy, beyond such mortal sight.Without a guide or light.Than that which burned so deeply in my heart.The fire 'twas led me on.And shined more bright than of the midday sun.To where he waited stillIt was a place where no one else could come.ChorusWithin my pounding heart.Which kept itself entirely for him.He fell into his sleep.Beneath the cedars all my love I gave.And by the fortress walls.The wind would brush his hair against his brow.And with its smoothest hand.Caressed my every sense it would allow.ChorusI lost myself to him.And laid my face upon my lover's breast.And care and grief grew dim.As in the morning's mist became the light.There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair.There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair.There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair.**The days are getting oh so long,And the paths so hard to find.How can I ever see the wayWhen I got you on my mind?When I was yours and you were mineThe path seemed oh so clear.But everything is dark as night,Now that you're not here.When I was yours, and you were mine,I said I'd love youFor all time.I thought you loved me, and maybe you do.But you're with someone else, and I still love you.Now even though you're with another,you can't get rid of me.I told you I'd never let you go,and I meant it you will see.Though I'm not yours and you're not mine,I am still here to say,"I told you that I loved you and I'll stick with you all ways."When I was yours, and you were mine,I said I'd love youFor all time.I thought you loved me, and maybe you do.But you're with someone else, and I still love you.**Got a picture of your house, with you standign by the door,

reed.That drowns the tender reed.~~~~~~Some say love it is a razorThat leaves the soul to bleed.Some say love it is a hunger, an endless aching need.But I say love it is a flowerAnd you it's only seed.It's the heart afraid of dyingIt's the heart afraid of breakingThat never learns to danceIt's the dream afraid of wakingThat never takes the chance.It's the one that won't be takenThat cannot seem to give.And the soul afraid of dyingThat never learns to live.When the night has been too lonely,And the road has been too long,And you think that love is onlyFor the lucky and the strong,Just remember in the winterFar beneath the bitter snowLies the seed, that with the sun's loveIn the spring, becomes the rose.**I've told you this, once, before, can't control meIf you, try, take, me down, you're gonna breakI feel your every, nothing that you're doing for meI'm thinking you are the measure of the way(chorus)I, stand alone,Inside I, Stand

My heart is drenched in wine   But you'll be on my mind   Forever   Out across the endless sea   I would die in ecstasy   But I'll be a bag of bones   Driving down the road alone   My heart

laceThe teacher wonders but she doesn't askIt's hard to see the pain behind the maskBearing the burden of a secret stormSometimes she wishes she was never bornThrough the wind and the rainShe stands hard as a stoneIn a world that she can't rise aboveBut her dreams give her wingsAnd she flies to a place where she's lovedConcrete angelSomebody cries in the middle of the nightThe

townThat you've been seen a-runnin' 'round. I know that I should leave, but then, I just can't go, you win again. This heart of mine could never seeWhat ev'rybody knew but me. Just trusting you was my great sin, What can I do? You win again. I'm sorry for your victim now'Cause soon his head like mine will bow. He'll give his heart, but all in vain, And someday say, you win again.You have no heart, you have no shame,

the air.You better watch out,There may be dogs aboutI've looked over Jordan, and I have seenThings are not what they seem.What do you get for pretending the danger's not real.Meek and obedient you follow the leaderDown well trodden corridors into the valley of steel.What a surprise!A look of terminal shock in your eyes.Now things are really what they seem.No, this is no bad dream.The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not wantHe makes me down to lieThrough pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by.With bright knives He releaseth my soul.He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places.He converteth me to lamb cutlets,For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger.When cometh the day we lowly ones,Through quiet reflection, and great dedicationMaster the art of karate,Lo, we shall rise up,And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water.Bleating and babbling I fell on his neck with a scream.Wave upon wave of demented avengersMarch cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream.Have you heard the news?The dogs are dead!You better stay homeAnd do as you're told.Get out of the road if you want to grow old.~ Pink Floyd**Yesterday is a wrinkle on your foreheadYesterday is a promise that you've brokenDon't close your eyes, don't close your eyesThis is your lifeAnd today is all you've got nowAnd today is all you've ever haveDon't close your eyes.This is your life are you who you want to be?This is your life are you who you want to be?This is your life, is it everything that you dreamsthat it would be when the world was younger.and you had everything to lose?Yesterday is a kid in the cornerYesterday is dead and over.This is your life, are you who you want to be?This is your life, are you who you want to be?~switchfoot**Waste, by Phish (Anastasio, T.) Dont want to be an actor pretending on the stage Dont want to be a writer with my thoughts out on the page Dont want to be a painter

an instrument of death Watch us as we pass the axe. [Blaze:] I took the axe off the shelf in the tool shed It's telling me I gotta fuckin bloody the misled My victim approached Cut her head off at the throat She was a hooker with AIDS Spreading disease like it was dope Cut the head off her pimp Before he started to trash talk Two bodies in my trunk and police on a manhunt I'm on the noose again They chasing me for blocks Seen a homie on the street So I passed the axe to Madrox [Madrox:] I took the axe What the fuck am I supposed to do with that? It's all bloody And it looks like its been in and out of someone's back Grips on the handle, blood dripping down the neck So I grabbed that bitch like *laugh* back Who wanna get halfed up by the half with Who got a gang of problems And don't give half a shit, bitch You can fall victim to the double headed furry Don't be scared, be worried, man. [Chorus:] Pass me, something sharp and wicked And I'll pass it back Don't worry I'll pass it back. It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked And I'll pass it back Don't worry I'll pass it back. [ABK:] I took the axe back to the shed where I stay Cleaned off the blood and then sharpened up the blade Waited 'til dark and then ran through the hood And chopped up drunk bums like they're blocks of wood I can't see myself stopping and if I do then I'm dead And the only way I'm dying is if I sever my own head Grip on the tip, so my nub won't slip And I'm about to fuckin' pass it to the hands of 2 Dope bitch [Shaggy:] I took your axe and swang it through like butter When I cut back you better run, duck, and cover. You know your jugular well, it's gone I blacked out last night and realized in the morning Gotta dig another hole in the backyard Run get me a shovel, it ain't that hard And understand that I got a hairpin trigger wrist When I squeeze it off, haha, you get the gist. [Chorus:] Pass me, something sharp and wicked And I'll pass it back Don't worry I'll pass it back. It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked And I'll pass it back Don't worry I'll pass it back. [Violent J:] I took the axe Perhaps I had a relapse I seen a pretty pretty neck And I couldn't relax I cut through it I throw knives with precision But it's noting like the feeling Of committing the incision Flip it over, a radio program I pound his head into a bloody pizza With the hammer Threw it into the sky and let it stick in my back And passed out at Monoxide's front porch like that. [Monoxide:] I took the axe and lost my fucking mind On this cop who pulled up behind me I handcuffed him on the side of the street And started smacking em with it like I was making a beat Oh God! Another cop pulled up So I grabbed the same axe and planted it in his forehead Two more dead, bloody and dismembered Now it's back in the shed and that's all I remember. [Chorus:] Pass me, something sharp and wicked And I'll pass it back Don't worry I'll pass it back. It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked And I'll pass it back Don't worry I'll pass it back. The axe that splits so many backs Its back to the tool shed to relax Peep that So many failed with no tale to tell. And it's only remembered be the stain they left On the axe.**All our times have comeHere, but now they're, goneSeasons don't fear the reaperNor do

oneIt comes to us allIt's as soft as your pillowYou used to be alrightWhat happened?Etcetera etceteraFacts for whateverFifteen stepsThen a shear drop**See her how she fliesGolden sails across the skyClose enough to touchBut be careful if you tryThough she looks as warm as goldThe moon's a harsh mistressThe moon can be so coldOnce the sun did shineLord, it felt so fineThe moon a phantom roseThrough the mountains and the pinesAnd then the darkness fellThe moon's a harsh mistressIt's hard to love her wellI fell out of her eyesI fell out of her heartI fell down on my face (yes I did)I tripped and missed my starAnd I fell and fell aloneThe moon's a harsh mistressAnd the sky is made of stoneThe moon's a harsh mistressShe's hard to call your own       By

far from my homeOh Mama I can hear you a cryin', you're so scared and all aloneHangman is comin' down from the gallows and I don't have very longThe jig is up, the noose is outThey finally found meThe renegade who had it madeRetrieved for a bountyNever more to go astrayThis will be the end todayOf the wanted manOh Mama, I've been years on the lam and had a high price on my headLawman said 'Get him dead or alive' and it's for sure he'll see me deadDear Mama I can hear you cryin', you're so scared and all aloneHangman is comin' down from the gallows and I don't have very longThe

PunchAnother day in this carnival of soulsAnother night settles in, as quickly as it goesThe memories are shadows; ink on the pageAnd I can't seem to find my way homeAnd it's almost likeYour heaven's trying everythingYour heaven's trying everythingTo keep me outAll the places I've been and things I've seenA million stories that made up a million shattered dreamsThe faces of people I'll never see againAnd I can't seem to find my way homeCause it's almost likeYour heaven's trying everythingTo break me downCause it's almost likeYour heaven's trying everythingTo keep me outCause it's almost likeYour heaven's trying everythingTo break me downCause it's almost likeYour heaven's trying everythingYour heaven's trying everythingTo break me downTo break me downTo break me downYour heavens trying everythingYour heavens trying everythingTo break me... down**0**"
