tmp_text "I cleaned up this board.  It had a lot of stuff on it that could go.All of the important information anyone might still need is in thethree to four notes that will follow this.  I have those separatedinto three groups.The general information note contains information on what to do ifyou are stuck on a trial, when you need to write a poem, song, andstory, and how to get help with those if you need it.There will be one note, or maybe two, about basic things to rememberin order to not get yourself in trouble as a bard.  Clarificationson the pk restriction, examples of unbardic behavior, etc.The last note will be specifically for those of you who are membersof the Alliance with the Knights.  I encourage all bards to jointhem in their fight against the evil in this land.  But pleaseremember, that doing so makes you subject to their rules as well asmine.  Please read the Alliance note for that information.-Star**The purpose of this note is to consolidate some of the very oldinformation that was on this board.  That will allow me to keep whatis still relevant, and get rid of what is not, in order to avoidconfusion.  I do suggest you read this note, as it should end up witha decent amount of generally useful information when I finish it.First, a general reminder that bard trials are to be done on your own.Please do not ask anyone for help on these.  There is a scroll inTuyen's room containing a few useful hints that will help with mostissues.  Type 'scrolls h' to read it.  Also please know that I haverecently tested the trials with my test character, and if they arebeing done properly they all work.  If you are seriously stuck, ask meor a GC.  You will be given a hint, but you will not be told how to doit.Now, on the subject of GCs, I know I need to update the lore file.As of right now, the GCs are Storm, Brak, Wolfsbane, and Brynna.Since most of you know who Brynna is, you know how to get in touchwith her.  As I'm sure you'll note, the others have not logged in fora very long time.  What this means is that I'm keeping them listed asGCs for the time being, but that if anyone else is interested, and isactive and doing what they need to do, I will gladly consider new GCs.Ideally, there should be five of them.Moving on to poems, songs, and stories..  I am going to try to explainwhen you need them, though I know half of you will still ask mebecause the way it works seems a little bit odd.  You need a poemapproved before doing the trial to obtain bard level 3.  Now keep inmind, that since you start as level 1, this means you need it beforedoing the second trial.  If you are currently sitting at level 2, youneed a poem to move on.  If you are level 5 right now, you need a songto move on to level 6.  And finally, if you are level 8, you need astory before doing the trial to become level 9.Not sure what to write about, or how to start?  Raphael, a bard ofold, had some notes here talking about some of the basics of writingpoems and stories.  I intend to re-post them on signs in the poem andstory rooms.  If you want them before then, just ask me.  Songs do nothave to be original, so there is no writing advice needed, but pleasedo not forget to note in the post or in the title who the artist is.I hope this information is helpful.  When in doubt, please feel freeto ask me or a GC.-Star**Please take the time to read through this note and the one followingit.  They contain a few clarifications and reminders on some of thethings in 'lore rules' and a few additional warnings and tips onstaying out of trouble.  If you are a part of the Alliance, pleasealso read the note titled "Alliance Info and Updates".I would say the biggest thing to remember while a bard is that we donot, under any circumstance, kill players.  One of the few things Iwill not tolerate from a bard is anything to do with player killing.That includes, but is not limited to, finding a way to kill anotherplayer, baiting someone into attacking you, or assisting someone tokill someone else.  The only exception to that last one is whencasting distort or heal spells on a knight who is out there fightingevil.  Do not give distort spells or any other type of aid to anyonewho you know, or can reasonably guess, will use that aid while killinganother player.That being said, if you do happen to be fighting in a pk area, and youare attacked by someone, you do have the right to defend yourself.Bard spells will currently work against any player who has attackedyou first.  When either player dies or leaves the room, the playerkilling restriction will reset, and your spells will no longer workagainst them.The other thing that will get someone kicked out of the guild in shortorder is helping someone to complete the bard trials.  As it states in'lore rules' the trials are in place of spending xp for levels.  Donot help anyone with this, because if you do, that person is gettinga free ride up through the guild.  The trials are not all that hard.Everyone needs to do them on their own.Those are the big ones.  Please read the note titled "Basic Rules -The Small Stuff" as well.  It includes a few general reminders andthings I would prefer not to see from bards.-Star**This post contains a few basic reminders on things generally thoughtto be unbardic.  Doing the things in this note will likely get you awarning from me or from a GC, and I would sincerely hope that onewarning would be enough.  For information on what will absolutely notbe tolerated and what will get you kicked out, with no more warningthan what is posted already, please read the previous post titled"Basic Rules - The BIG stuff".Bards are a good guild.  As such, we should be aiding those on theside of good, and not those on the side of evil.  While I have alwayssaid that bards are rebels who love a scandal, and that is true,please do not go around helping people who choose to keep a constantlyevil balance to their souls.  A generally neutral person who is oncein a while on the evil side is fine.  It is well known that there arepeople here who live life in the middle.  But we all know, prettymuch, who is always evil and loves it.Along those lines, please feel encouraged to join the Alliance.  Itis not mandatory, but it has almost been expected through the years.As a good guild, working to do good deeds, it seems to make sense toally with and assist others who do the same.Even if you do not belong to the Alliance, please keep in mind thataiding a criminal in any way is an offense for which the Knights willlikely make you a criminal.  While this will not get you removed fromthe bards, any bard who is also a part of the Alliance will not beable to assist you with anything.  If you do wish to avoid this, askan ally or a knight before handing out a distort or any other aid tosomeone you do not know.  They can check if that person is a criminal.One more small thing to consider.  It is generally not considered agood or noble thing to "smack talk" or "flap".  Let's be honestpeople.  It's not nice to tell someone that you had sex with theirmother, sister, etc., ad nauseum.  Therefore, let me go on record assaying that that kind of behavior is not bardic.  In general, likeThumper said, "If you can't say anything nice, don't say nuthin at all."-Star**I just wanted to post a few reminders and updates about the Alliance,for new bards and old alike.  As all, or most, of you know, a bard ispromised entry into the Knight's Alliance, and all that is requiredto join is that you go upstairs from here and check out Alexander.However, it has been recently brought to my attention that a bard whohas been kicked out of the alliance can simply go up there andre-join.  I am planning to look into a way to block this from beingpossible, but for now, let me put it this way.     If you are kicked out of the Alliance by either a     knight, a wiz, or a bardic GC, and you walk back     upstairs and join up again, you will very shortly     find yourself no longer a bard!Being a part of the Knight's Alliance is a priviledge, not a right.If you have broken their rules, you must live with the consequence.While I may or may not look the other way if you aid a criminal, theywill not.  Keep in mind that if you are made a criminal yourself anybard who is part of the Alliance will likely be unwilling to assistyou, and I will support them in that decision.I have been talking with Marek about the Alliance of old, and how hehas been working to hunt criminals.  As a bard, if you see a crimeoccur, he has said that you can speak with him or send him a mail.In the near future, I hope to have a board in the Tower of Hope, anda portal from the bardic guild to get there.  For those of you whoare not familier with it, the Tower of Hope is a small tower actuallymade for the Knights to honor their allies, bards or otherwise.If you are an ally, and you would like to avoid getting into trouble,a list of players online who are criminals can be seen by typingcwho.  In addition to that list, Knight Allies should not be partyingwith or aiding Shardaks, Cybers, or in general anyone who is evil.-Star**I was wondering if there is a way to mark those that are not good so that younger Bards can know the difference? Or if there is some way to create a feature that shows alignment? Just a thought, maybe a fun item to possess....****It used to be possible with the finger command to see any player'salignment.  That was removed, and I'm sure there was good reason forit.  If I had to guess, I'd say it was because you can't tell ifsomeone is good or evil simply by looking at them.That being said, bards of guild level 3 gain the spell 'balance' whichwill tell you the alignment of the target.  Since guild level 3 is available at game level 5, and all bards are level 5 or higher onadmission to the guild, it shouldn't be difficult for anyone at allto attain a spell that allows them to check someone's alignment.And again, members of the Knight's alliance can tell by using thecwho command.  It lists both criminals and evil players.  If you donot have bard level 3, and would like to know, you can either jointhe Alliance, or ask a knight to check for you if one is around.  Youcould, of course, also ask any bard higher than guild level 3.Star**I woke from a nap to see a few comments on the bard line aboutStar and her habit of skinny-dipping.  Since this is not the first time a comment has been made about her doing so at herage, I am going to take the time to address the issue here foreveryone to see.Yes, Star is a young child.  Yes, she routinely gets naked inthe guild hall.  No, this is not disgusting, nor does it countas kiddie porn or pedophilia in any way.  Please note theclothing talked about in her description.  She wears knickers,and a loose blouse.  This child comes from a past time, whenbathing suits did not exist, and all bathing was done in thenude, generally alone or in the company of those of the samegender.This NPC has been in the guild hall since the day it was coded.She is based on a character in short stories that the originalcoder of the guild used to write in his spare time.  She is achild of a more innocent time, when people's first reactionsto a naked girl were not what they are now.  Please look at herand her habits with a mind as innocent as hers.  I do not planto change her because she has always been a part of the guild,and I wish to respect Saber by leaving his code in place.Lastly, please do not take this note as yelling at anyone.  AsI said, this has been mentioned by more than one person, so Ifelt that the most efficient way to answer it was to put it ina place where everyone sees it.Star (The grown-up one)**I was just wondering if any other Bards play here? Please let me know... Star, I was just wondering if at all possiable that us(all Bards) can have a room where we can call our own since we are a select few. One that we can store our own items/weapons/armour with furniture and such? Just a thought and thanks (lool) ~qli**I have wrote two songs that need approval, please look so i can level up to 6.. Thanks**I have waited a long time to hear from anyone about my two songs for being able to level in the guild. I would like someone to help me on this or transfer me to an active guild. I love being a bard but there is no one on here that plays on a daily basis in this guild. Just need some help on this matter. Thank you****0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
