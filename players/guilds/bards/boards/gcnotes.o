tmp_text "1) You can now use the check_former command to see who has quit theguild before and when.  As a general rule, at least a month shouldpass before re-joining, and no one should be allowed to rejoin ifthey've quit three times.  Of course, sometimes a character will bepurged, and the name claimed by someone else, so use your judgement.2) I'm sorry I let this board get full.  I'll try to keep it cleanedout in the future.3) Please do not make policy changes without consulting with mefirst.  I trust you guys to run the guild, but for major policychanges, I need to be consulted first.  (I've replaced star's noteto the guild on distorts.)4) Try to be brief and concise when posting notes to the entireguild.  Most people are not going to take the time to read more thana few lines, so keep the message short enough that they'll actuallyget the message.5) Star, you need a new subject for your notes and mails <grin>**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
