A Fflam(fflam, May 12, 9)
A Fflam is courageous, a Fflam is bold,
  for generations this was true, I'm told.

A Fflam is loyal, a Fflam is devout,
  with his last breath, his oath he'll shout.

A Fflam is true, A Fflam tells no lies,
  he does not dissemble until the day he dies.

A Fflam is decisive, A Fflam can choose,
  never will he hesitate, and lose

A Fflam has history, ancestors to respect
  if he does not, they'll make him regret.

A Fflam labours hard, A Fflam works hard
  though never before has a Fflam been a Bard.
