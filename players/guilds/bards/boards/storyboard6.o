new_text "	In the days of when I was a child, I remember how the now fabled warriors were. Their platemail was not always gleaming and strength not always unyielding. They bled red and cried the same tears as you or I.  Most of all, I recall how they stood for a chosen cause. On the foggy coastal plains of Nirvana, many brave warriors fought for the causes of good and held evils at bay. My mind rests on the war between the invading goblin armies and the Knights Templar with their Allies. 	The sun rarely shone through those stormy clouds and the land seemed wrapped in a blanket of darkness. The very wind itself seemed to howl in anguish as it blew over those goblin and ogre ridden shores. These armies were building and churning, waiting for the right moment to break through and storm Nirvana, pillaging and killing as they went. The time was ripe for the land to plunge into an era of darkness and turmoil.	It was decided that the Knights and Allies would stand up and bind together, forming a wall through which no evil could pass. So warriors took up their weapons and others offered their own special skills in any way they could. Healers would heal, and non-combatants would provide a steady flow of resources and encouragement. Those lands became a proving ground for the Knights and their Allies. Rifts that were once tearing began to close and many new lasting bonds were formed. 	The first hours of battle tested their strength, quick reflexes and endurance. Assassins trained by the goblin armies were sent out to murder Knights, Allies and unwarily townsfolk. These dark forms would creep into any unlocked nook or cranny that held an ounce of valor. Knights stood watch in the castle order to protect their resting brothers and sisters. Justin was one of the many that guarded the castle from intruders and fought those who dared risk falling under his deadly blade. The Knights quickly realized they must drive the invaders into the sea and back to their own unknown land.	A host of Templar Knights with their Allies led by Stone stormed the northwestern front as a small entourage led by Ghost attacked at the southwestern end. Not knowing how vast the goblin armies had grown, the two divisions had planned to split the opposing forces and meet in the middle. As the battle progressed, it became clear that Ghost and Pino needed to regroup with the main campaign. Hordes of goblins and ogres had surged around them, preventing safe passage to return. It was hard and some even say that Ghost fell under the blade of the goblins only to come back to the living and continue on. Finally, after much battle, they reconvened with the larger party and began to fight again. Together they found that they could defeat the goblin invasion. 	Hours of bloodshed turned into days and still the fierce sounds of battle rang throughout the land. Yet even in the days that followed morale continued to rise and more and more people stood up to assist these brave warriors in their cause. People remembered the days of old when the guild of Templar Knights stood proud and unified. They began to speak the names that were being written in history like Stone, Jarana, Whitedawn, Ghost, Daredevil, Beowulf, Cooper, Little, and so many others.	Slowly as the week progressed the huge army of 8,200 ogres and goblins were beaten back and only two strongholds remained. The Knights and Allies had finally reached the goblin base camp and the cave of the red dragon clan. The dragon king, Falesgauntriax, King of the Reds, had allied himself with the goblins and was prepared to fight. A short council was held and it was decided that the dragons were a greater threat and a band of warriors set out to invade the cave. Once inside, they were met by onslaughts of darklings and numerous minor dragons. Finally, they reached the massive dragon. The air in the royal cavern reeked of sulfur and the beasts soft underbody was encrusted with jewels. Unwillingly to turn back and give up after coming so far, they bravely faced him. Flames singed and burned; smoke made it hard to breathe and yet after the air cleared, the mighty dragon king lay defeated. 	A promise of victory was on the mind of every individual who participated in those long battles. Only one windy tent stood between them and then they could restore the peace of Nirvana. Again the forces regrouped to plan the siege on the base camp. Together, the Knights with their Allies stormed the lonely stronghold and defeated the enemies outside of the tent. Inside, however, lay Garshlog, King of the Goblins decked out in pounds of jewels and an uncountable number of robes. Garshlog was huge, tall, very, very obese, ugly, and smelled of a mix of rotten eggs, rancid pork, and two month old pizza. Stone led the attack and fought bravely with his brothers and sisters. Even the King of the Goblins could not stand up to the Knights with their Allies and with a loud, reverberating thud, he crashed to the ground, dead. 	Tired and worn, the Knights and Allies stood united in victory. What remained of the goblin army dissipated into darker realms or was killed. Only a small clan of defeated Red Dragons remained hidden deep within their caves. 	Rumors had been spreading like wildfire that the late King had somehow found the mighty sword Excalibur and kept it with him at all times. Whispers said that it was hidden in his personal tent. Stone spotted a hidden treasure room and found the mighty sword Excalibur hidden in a treasure chest. The magnificent sword once wielded by King Arthur was presented to Stone in honor of his leadership, skill, and many other attributes on the battlefield.	Silence washed over the land as the sounds of the fierce battle fell quiet. The invading armies had been defeated and their strongholds were destroyed. The coastal plains lay soaked in blood and chaos. Something needed to be built in order for no enemy to get so close to overrunning the land of Nirvana again. Not merely a watchtower, but a new Templar stronghold that could stand up to such opposing forces. 	It was decided that with the wealth earned off of the defeated soldiers would build a castle to prevent invaders from getting so close again and keep watch on the cave of the dragons. This castle would become the new home for the Knights Templar and would be welcome to their Allies at all times. Not long after this, Fortress Stone stood proud overlooking the vast oceans to the west. Its thick walls could withstand any siege and the test of time.	Slowly, people came to the fortress and built up a small town. This grew into a booming port-city eventually, which they named New Ares. Shops, inns, and taverns sprung up and with this more people arrived. They told tales of a time that was now passed of gleaming platemail and unyielding strength. Even now, people still rejoice when they hear about the warriors that fought for them, and will forever.Many thanks to the brave warriors who fought for this land and the wizards that help guide them. This historic event was captured topaper by Breezy the Bard."
