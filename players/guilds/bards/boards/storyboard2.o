new_head "Quest for the Kirin"
new_text "A young journeyman awakens in a field after a long sleep, his eyes slightly blurred as he looks around. The Breeze softly tugs at his hair as the sun warms his skin.He stands up and looks around as he remembers what task he has been sent to do, he ventures down the path in which he began the day before. Walking down the road he reaches into his pack to grab a cool drink from his camelskin.As he ventures down the road he comes across a deep dark forest, fears of the darkness flood his mind as screams and odd noises flood his ears from within the forest.As he takes his first step into the woods he steps on a branch as a loud crack echos through the wooded area as it grows silent of a sudden.A rustling of leaves comes from the right side of him as a small flash of light shoots in front of him and floats around his face. At a closer glance he notices that this is a fairy of the ancient realms.He asks himself could this really be..... is this what really is in front of my eyes right now. As he stretches his hand towards the faerie it seems to lead him through the path of the forest as if to guide him away from danger.Every turn on each side of the darkness growls can be heard as eyes glow in the shadows, stalkers just waiting for the wrong step to end his life with their gnashing teeth.As hours seem to pass he comes to the end of the forest to an enchanted meadow. The faerie slowly drifts down behind a huge mushroom and disappears.As he looks around searching for his ever so blessed guide he looks behind the mushroom in which the faerie went, A mass group of faeries fly up from behind the mushroom and encircle him in dust as he collapses and faints.Soon after awhile he hears singing in the surrounding area which awakens him to the sleep in which was induced by the dust of the faerie magic.Gasping in astonishment, to his eyes what does he see the kirin of ancient myths and tales in which he was sent to take the horn of and bring back to his elder in his small tribe.Seeing the magnificant beauty of this mythical creature he cannot bring himself to kill such a creature as the kirin slowly approaches he freezes in fear.The kirin softly walks up to him and lowers it's head and touch him on  the forehead with his horn. A warmth spreads up his body as he is blessed by the kirin.Reaching to run his hands down the kirins mane, the kirin rolls him on it's back and rides off into the distance taking him to an unknown realm of peace.The Kirin teaches him all of the abilities of nature and balance as he has the connection of telepathy to this creature through the blessing that was given to him.Several years pass as he grows and learns to control and balance his inner powers and powers of nature and the elements,  the kirin finally takes him to the place in which it had taken him from.He takes the journey back home and wanders back into the tribe with no horn in hand. The elder of the village questions him of the horn and why he came back with his task not done....The elder raises his hand to start to cast him from the village as the boy shows his inner powers of nature and magic and the elder collapses in fear as the elder bows to the young journeyman. Becoming the new leader of the tribe he brings balance and peace with people and nature amongst the years to come."

tmp_text "Once upon a time, shrouded in the mists of yesteryear, Saber formedthe bards.  He envisioned a peaceful people, fighting with none of the other inhabitants of the land, singing, dancing, and bringing joyeverywhere they roamed.  His dream was realized, and the Bards were ahappy bunch.  Unfortunately, there are those who despise peace and joy,and want nothing more than to destroy it whenever they can.  Eventuallysituations arose where they would attempt to harm Saber's peaceful bards,which created quite a problem.  With their peaceful beliefs and happy-go-lucky lifestyles, the bards were appalled at the idea of violence, but hadto have some recourse to right the wrongs done against them.  Saber satdown with Molasar and Sandman to solve the problem, and thus the Alliancewas born.  A room was constructed upstairs in the bards' guild...a peacefulroom, with a fire kept always crackling on the hearth.  Alexander wasplaced on guard there, and tha paladins were to share this room with the bards.  In this room, one could see Alexander about joining the Alliance.Bards could see him about wielding two weapons, and paladins could obtainthe coveted bardswords.  Both guilds prospered under the arrangement, andthe wrongs against the bardic people were righted by the paladins' holy wrath.A certain bard had business one day on the other side of a dangerous land.He called his strongest pet to help in any peril that might occur, and setout.  Not far into his journey he noticed he was being followed.  It seemedas if more than one of the strangers were on his trail and he readied himselffor the inevitable as best he could.  Before long, they attacked:  three ofthem, armed to the teeth and members of the most evil group of people in theland.  Loyal to the end, the bard's pet jumped in to defend his master, andwas brutally slain in battle.  Injured from the mental backlash of losinghis companion, the bard knew he could not survive much longer.  He ran forthe safety of Ryllian, calling for the paladins as he went.  Before longthey started to appear and quickly spread throughout the area searchingfor the assailants.  It wasn't long before one of them sounded the alarm.They had been found, and cornered.  A viscious fight ensued, steal clashingand blood flowing.  The paladins eventually gained the upper hand and thebattle came to an end.  The evil were vanquished once again, and the paladinssaw the bard safely through the dangerous lands and to his destination.Other advantages also sprang from the alliance.  People from the two groupsfrequently united for hunting parties throughout the land, together purgingit of dragons, goblins, wraiths, and other such evil creatures.  There weremany marraiges between the two groups, and children played happily togetherin front of the fire, safe at the feet of Alexander.  The good prospered.Then, suddenly, an evil greater than anyone ever imagined spread across theland.  The Alliance was defeated, the bards and paladins destroyed, theguildhalls in ruins.  The lands of Nirvana went through many years in this dark period, and new forces of good sprung up here and there.  Now it is timefor the return of the bards, the reconstruction of their guildhall, and fornew alliances to be formed.  The happy voices of singing bards have finallyreturned to the land.  You'd best watch out, lest some overly happy bard bouncea bauble of light off your head.**	In the days of when I was a child, I remember how the now fabled warriors were. Their platemail was not always gleaming and strength not always unyielding. They bled red and cried the same tears as you or I.  Most of all, I recall how they stood for a chosen cause. On the foggy coastal plains of Nirvana, many brave warriors fought for the causes of good and held evils at bay. My mind rests on the war between the invading goblin armies and the Knights Templar with their Allies.         The sun rarely shone through those stormy clouds and the land seemed wrapped in a blanket of darkness. The very wind itself seemed to howl in anguish as it blew over those goblin and ogre ridden shores. These armies were building and churning, waiting for the right moment to break through and storm Nirvana, pillaging and killing as they went. The time was ripe for the land to plunge into an era of darkness and turmoil.        It was decided that the Knights and Allies would stand up and bind together, forming a wall through which no evil could pass. So warriors took up their weapons and others offered their own special skills in any way they could. Healers would heal, and non-combatants would provide a steady flow of resources and encouragement. Those lands became a proving ground for the Knights and their Allies. Rifts that were once tearing began to close and many new lasting bonds were formed.         The first hours of battle tested their strength, quick reflexes and endurance. Assassins trained by the goblin armies were sent out to murder Knights, Allies and unwarily townsfolk. These dark forms would creep into any unlocked nook or cranny that held an ounce of valor. Knights stood watch in the castle order to protect their resting brothers and sisters. Justin was one of the many that guarded the castle from intruders and fought those who dared risk falling under his deadly blade. The Knights quickly realized they must drive the invaders into the sea and back to their own unknown land.        A host of Templar Knights with their Allies led by Stone stormed the northwestern front as a small entourage led by Ghost attacked at the southwestern end. Not knowing how vast the goblin armies had grown, the two divisions had planned to split the opposing forces and meet in the middle. As the battle progressed, it became clear that Ghost and Pino needed to regroup with the main campaign. Hordes of goblins and ogres had surged around them, preventing safe passage to return. It was hard and some even say that Ghost fell under the blade of the goblins only to come back to the living and continue on. Finally, after much battle, they reconvened with the larger party and began to fight again. Together they found that they could defeat the goblin invasion.        Hours of bloodshed turned into days and still the fierce sounds of battle rang throughout the land. Yet even in the days that followed morale continued to rise and more and more people stood up to assist these brave warriors in their cause. People remembered the days of old when the guild of Templar Knights stood proud and unified. They began to speak the names that were being written in history like Stone, Jarana, Whitedawn, Ghost, Daredevil, Beowulf, Cooper, Little, and so many others.**	Slowly as the week progressed the huge army of 8,200 ogres and goblins were beaten back and only two strongholds remained. The Knights and Allies had finally reached the goblin base camp and the cave of the red dragon clan. The dragon king, Falesgauntriax, King of the Reds, had allied himself with the goblins and was prepared to fight. A short council was held and it was decided that the dragons were a greater threat and a band of warriors set out to invade the cave. Once inside, they were met by onslaughts of darklings and numerous minor dragons. Finally, they reached the massive dragon. The air in the royal cavern reeked of sulfur and the beasts soft underbody was encrusted with jewels. Unwillingly to turn back and give up after coming so far, they bravely faced him. Flames singed and burned; smoke made it hard to breathe and yet after the air cleared, the mighty dragon king lay defeated.         A promise of victory was on the mind of every individual who participated in those long battles. Only one windy tent stood between them and then they could restore the peace of Nirvana. Again the forces regrouped to plan the siege on the base camp. Together, the Knights with their Allies stormed the lonely stronghold and defeated the enemies outside of the tent. Inside, however, lay Garshlog, King of the Goblins decked out in pounds of jewels and an uncountable number of robes. Garshlog was huge, tall, very, very obese, ugly, and smelled of a mix of rotten eggs, rancid pork, and two month old pizza. Stone led the attack and fought bravely with his brothers and sisters. Even the King of the Goblins could not stand up to the Knights with their Allies and with a loud, reverberating thud, he crashed to the ground, dead.         Tired and worn, the Knights and Allies stood united in victory. What remained of the goblin army dissipated into darker realms or was killed. Only a small clan of defeated Red Dragons remained hidden deep within their caves.         Rumors had been spreading like wildfire that the late King had somehow found the mighty sword Excalibur and kept it with him at all times. Whispers said that it was hidden in his personal tent. Stone spotted a hidden treasure room and found the mighty sword Excalibur hidden in a treasure chest. The magnificent sword once wielded by King Arthur was presented to Stone in honor of his leadership, skill, and many other attributes on the battlefield.        Silence washed over the land as the sounds of the fierce battle fell quiet. The invading armies had been defeated and their strongholds were destroyed. The coastal plains lay soaked in blood and chaos. Something needed to be built in order for no enemy to get so close to overrunning the land of Nirvana again. Not merely a watchtower, but a new Templar stronghold that could stand up to such opposing forces.         It was decided that with the wealth earned off of the defeated soldiers would build a castle to prevent invaders from getting so close again and keep watch on the cave of the dragons. This castle would become the new home for the Knights Templar and would be welcome to their Allies at all times. Not long after this, Fortress Stone stood proud overlooking the vast oceans to the west. Its thick walls could withstand any siege and the test of time.        Slowly, people came to the fortress and built up a small town. This grew into a booming port-city eventually, which they named New Ares. Shops, inns, and taverns sprung up and with this more people arrived. They told tales of a time that was now passed of gleaming platemail and unyielding strength. Even now, people still rejoice when they hear about the warriors that fought for them, and will forever.Many thanks to the brave warriors who fought for this land and the wizards that help guide them. This historic event was captured topaper by Breezy the Bard.**It was several years ago, more then I would like to admit, that wordcame to the lands of Nirvana that a ancient and evil creature had onceagain been sighted.  As usually happens the news traveled quickly tothe Bards of Ryllian and the family got together.Something must be done, we cannot let Icing Death roam free, toomany good people will get hurt, Blazzer spoke up, there were nodsof agreement from those gathered there.Fipogee stood up, and a hush fell over the room, usually he was theone with the silly joke or the gag to play on everyone, but this timehe wasnt.  He had a dead serious look on his face, as though he knewwhat was going to happen.  Ill go, I need a few people to go with methough.  He looked over to Blazzer and the old bard nodded at him,saying he would go with.Fipogee leaned over to Blazzer and asked him,I really think we should take one of the new guys with us, we need the power and at the same time it would be a wonderful learning experience for them.I think Bambua is our man, he shows a lot of promise, Ive beenwith him a lot lately, his head is in the right space.  He just needs some confidence.The two bards approached me and asked me to come with, I was nervous but I said that I would go.  I didnt want to disappoint them.  We collected our gear and the rest of the Bards gave us heals and food and drink for the trip.  They bid us their best luck and we were on our way.  Most of the journey there was a blurto me, I was too busy listening to the bards tell me what wasexpected of me.  They tried to keep it light with jokes and songs [Dalong the way but I knew that what we were doing was very dangerous.For the fight Blazzer was going to be leading against the beast, while Fipogee handled any monsters that joined the fight.  I was tasked with healing.  As I approached Icing Death, I had neverseen nor heard of a creature as foul as this one was.  It scowled at us from deep within its very being.  The fight itself was veryhard, we charged in and began weaving our songs through magic, the beast fought very tough it flung everything it had at us.  A few times I thought that I was going to loose my good friend, but we prevailed.  After long moments of fighting at our feet theblood of Icing Death and our own mingled, but it was his corpse laying at our feet, and us standing there victoriously.We returned to Ryllian to the cheers of not only the Bards and our allies the Paladins, but from some of the less then friendlymembers of our lands as well.  If this fight taught me anything about being a bard it was that if we work together nothing..nothing could stand in our way.  The lessons our Harper taught us are just too wise and together anything can be accomplished.**Once, during the dawn of the Second Age, when theBards were still newly formed, there existed a groupof holy warriors from the land of Rowan known as thePaladins.  The Bards of Ryllian quickly forged analliance with their neighbors and for the first timein recent memory, the tide of evil began to abate.Harper and the leader of the Paladins, Snowfire, wouldopen their festhalls for grand celebrations and theAlliance was much loved by all.Once, during the dawn of the Second Age, when the Bards were still newlyformed, there existed a group of holy warriors from the land of Rowanknown as the Paladins.  The Bards of Ryllian quickly forged anAlliance with their neighbors and for the first time in memory, the tide of evil began to abate.  Harper and the leader of the Paladins, Snowfire, would open their festhalls for grand celebrations and the Alliancewas much loved by all.However, while they were in retreat, the forces of darkness were not defeated; theyregrouped and sought an opportunity.  One presented itself inthe person of Balathuil.  Balathuil was a paladin and almost as accomplishedas the triad of Snowfire, Arioch, and Wendell.  However, their longevityand the refusal of the other paladins to allow them to retire preventedBalathuil from attaining the heights of power he craved.  At first,Balathuil tried to lose himself in his work in an effort to ignore thefeelings of envy that gnawed away at his soul.  But his long journiesalone on the road only have the darkness time to whisper in his ear.Every time a paladin would fall on the field of battle, Balathuil wouldwonder if they would have survived had he been leading the charge.Every time Snowfire made a decision, Balathuil would seek some flaw inhis logic.  Finally, consumed with hatred and crazed from the whisperingdarkness, Balathuil came upon a plan: to save the paladins he would killSnowfire.  With the inept leader disposed of, Balathuil would lead theguild to new heights of glory!Finally, the night of the new moon came and Balathuil set out on hiswretched task.  He coated his blade with the poisonous nyteshade plant and stole into the Commander's wing of the castle.  The unsuspectingguard assumed Balathuil was there to ask the Triad a question--it is saidhe cried as the poisoned sword was run through him, both for his failureto perform his duty and for the soul of Balathuil.  As the guard's blooddripped on Balathuil's armor, it twisted the steelchanging it into a matte-black mockery of the platemail Balathuil hadworn as a Paladin.Balathuil burst into Snowfire's room, surprising him.  Although he waswithout his armor, Snowfire quickly armed himself with the greatswordthat Mordrake, a noble of Rowan, had gifted him.  Their battle wasgreat--Snowfire, without his armor, could not strike a final blow with-out exposing himself to the poison of the sword and Balathuil beganto realize, to his increasing horror, that Snowfire's skill with a bladewas unmatched, for he could not penetrate his defenses.  For hours theyfought, the other paladins forbidden to interfere with the melee.  Finally,the sun began to rise and Balathuil, fearing he would lose the giftsthe darkness had granted, pressed for an advantage.  His haste proved tobe his undoing.  Snowfire evaded his wild swings and drove his bladethrough Balathuil's torso in a single, mighty stroke.  Balathuil's bloodpooled into the final shadows of the night and he sunk away intonothingness.It is said that the spirit of Balathuil remains, beneath even the darkest shadow, locked in torment with the knowledge of his failings.**	Born into this new world, I am a child of innocence.  No telling where I come from, or where my roots lie.  Abandoned at infancy, I was raised by a household of strangers that came to love me as their own.  I, Mercy, am unique; I have intensely captivating violet eyes and long, wavy brown hair.   Encased by an aura of purity, I am accompanied by an unblemished soul and captivating ability to bring peace to those in my presence.	I have survived; the fire destroyed everything and the invasion left many for dead.  Some ran away, others died trying.  The entire village is gone, vanished from the earth as if never existed.  I had to find a new home; I was desperate to find the place I belonged.	I traveled for days along dusty roads to these lands.  I heard a lot about Nirvana in my time, and finally was about to see for myself if what I heard was true.  I was completely taken back by what I found.  People of all types and personalities, both the good and the bad, reside here.  This is a place of creation, excitement, and the unusual; I have decided to make Nirvana my home.  	Word spreads quickly around these parts, I've noticed.  There is never a dull moment when there are so many different types in one place, all trying to abide by the minimal rules to avoid jail or banishment.  It's no out of the ordinary to be mistaken for something you're not, or to be challenged by someone, just so they can prove themselves.  This world is very competitive; people here strive to stand out from the crowd to be noticed for their accomplishments.		There are many different groups here, each with a set common interest amongst its members.  I have found my place amongst a guild; I am a bard.  I am happy with my new life I will live upon the merry, fight for the reign of good, and live thru song until the day I die.  **He had heard the legends.  He had had prepared for battle.  Soon the AXE would be his.Razberrypopartsalad heard that Tol'kar's axe was a worthy prize for his amory.  He needed such weapons in his possession for the up coming invasion.  But with his arch Nemisis Maxy still active the invasion would have to wait.  No matter how hard he tried he always seemed to miss this elusive vamp sometimes but just a few seconds.But first things first the AXE is needed.  It lies in a museum with many other artifacts perhaps in time he will aquire these items as well.  but these thoughts are of the future he needs to stay in the now.  He nears the doorway.Odd its just floating there in midair nothing behind it strange.  There are many strange things in this world thoughnot everything makes sense here.  In fact very few things made sense in this world.  Enough looking, Raz slides though the door.Ahh the clear orb and black pedestal.  Now what was he suppose to do.  Yes he remembers placing his hand on the orb he says,"museum".  A bright Flash!  He's no longer in the void,  he now stands in a vast clear room.  He slides north along the hall.Raz come to a readout of previous battles.  He spits on the name of Maxy who defeated Jerek.  "Soon my name will be here" he thinks to himself.  Raz makes a selection...  Tol'kar...  Now is Raz's time let the games begin....**As I stroll across this great land, killing all the evil that crosses my path.Going from realm to realm, gaining as many coins and experience as I can, all the while learning more and more about my lore. Learning it to the best of my ability.  With my trusty phoenix, Sweety, at my side there is not much that we can not destroy.One day I get in my head a wild burr, to kill the Queen ant. I have heard It has only been done once before by a group of characters.  So, to the forest I run, to stocking up on splooge and jellies. Getting as many as Ican carry in my handy little bag.  Once they are all packed I head backto the Hall of Images.Upon entering the hall there is a board, showing all who has killed the Queen ant. To get my name upon that board would be such a feat, andto be the first bard to do it at that. Now, that would be a great honor forguild and for myself. Killing off ant by ant, getting myself closer to the queen, one by one wekill them off. Placing part after part into the bag. Sweety and I conquerthem all. As we kill off the Royal ants just before the queen, I sit and ask"can I do this by myself?". Knowing my lore I should be fine. I take Sweety with me, but do not allow her to attack. For if I should die I donot want to sacrifice her for this silly move on my part.Upon entering the room, armed with only a summersword and the rest of myarmor. I cast agony upon her, then attack. Though her many hits and colorfulhits, I thrust my sword deep within her body. Using as many tunes of elementalpower as I can before I must calm, and heal. As I weaken her a little in the firstround, quickly I sing a song of  regeneration upon myself, eating as many splooge and jelly as I can to get back to health. Attacking again, once againletting as many tunes of elemental power, escape from my recoder as fast as I can play them, and stabbing my sword deep. Causing more and more damagewith each strike and each song. She gets pretty weak as I must calm again and detox.  Just now I realize, my lore has done me well, and so has the knowing how to use it in combat situations. To this I thank our creators for giving us all that they have to make us this great.Now I attack her again, with greater enthusiasm. Hitting her with such force, and singing tunes of elemental power left and right. To my amazement, shefinally succumbs to the greatness that has attacked her. For armed with my lore and my mighty sword, I have over taken her.For now, I can be proud knowing that I have done something for the good of my guild.  I have proved that a Bard can do anything.**   As I wonder across this great place, I hear of a great feat, that only thegreat have ever attempted. The Elemental Test.  Many have tried, the greatest have succeeded, and the ill prepared have failed. To be among these greatwarriors is such a great accomplishment, and to be the first bard, even better.    The first time that I stepped into the arena of this great task, I was easilydefeated by the great Flame.  I did not let this dampen my spirits, for this would be one task that I would keep attempting till I succeeded.   With the aid from some of our greatest allies, Cooper, Jarana, and Ghost.They went out of their way to let me tag along in their parties, being ever sogenerous to help me get the 300k in coins that I needed, just for the necessary heals.    Quickly, I traveled about, from place to place, acquiring the lightest and best equipment I could get.  Soon I was ready for the greatest quest I have had so far.  Taking time to listen to the words of wisdom from the those whohad tackled this great feat.  Checking and double checking that I had every-thing I needed, and that I had everything in line. I headed off again to meetmy fate.   Upon entering the arena, quickly I dropped my bag and grabbed the few things I needed from it. Not wanting to let it weigh me down. Now I was Ready.   First was Granite, knowing from the first time that this was a monster I could easily handle from the last time.  He seemed to die ever so slowly,singing tunes of elemental, eventually he took his last breath and fell to thefloor.   Then I was attacked by the great Flame, knowing that if I didn't watchmyself closely, I would meet my demise.  So, I left him attack with all his might, while I focused on keeping myself in good shape.  Knowing that soon he would slow down, and then I would have my chance.  After what seemed like no time at all he calmed down, then I stepped up to the plate. Attacking him with more force and tunes of elemental, soon he to became a victim of my power and strength.   Next was Wave, knowing after just a couple attacks, that just hitting with my sword wasn't going to do.  I began to sing tune after tune of element. Seeing this hurt him more than anything else I did in my feeble attack.Proudly I sang with pride, knowing that the great bardic powers that we hold within our voice.  Soon he to fell to my attack, to my own surprise that I hadeven made it this far.    Wind came up next, he attacked very aggressively, but could not with stand being attacked. He died very quickly.   Finally was the last monster, he stood before me with great strength.  Not being afraid to use what heals I had left in my bag, I attacked with everything I had left in me.  Sing tunes of elemental after tune, hitting him left and right with my mighty sword.  On the verge of being so full and unable to take another drink of my shake, he finally succumbed to my attack. To myself I gave out a sigh of relief.  To my great surprise, I had finished one of the greatest tasks a person can accomplish here.  The best part would have to be getting the nice title and picking out one of the best pieces of equipment one could ever ask for. 88**	Katya's Life StoryKatya was born on Nirvana in the late 1990's.  She was abandoned by her parents at a very young age.  She searched most of her life for a home and a new family that she could call her own, and that would love her unconditionally.  By the time she was level 5, Katya had searched many lands and realms for a place that would make her feel like she belonged.  During this time, she came upon the clan of the Dervish.  She asked them quite a few questions regarding anything and everything they might know about themselves and the type of life style they lived.  After careful consideration, Katya thought that this was the life that she wanted.  She thought she would be loved and feel like she belonged.  After a few years of being a Dervish and living that life, she came to the conclusion that this was not the life for her.  This was not what she had wanted and dreamt of all those years.At the level of 15, Katya decided to go on an adventure to find herself and what she should actually be doing with her life.  She traveled different worlds, realms, anywhere she possibly be able to wander.  Her travels brought her to this one dark place.  Later she came to find out this is where a family of Vampires lived.  As time went on, she spoke to as many of these Vampires as she could.  Later, she finally found Catalina and spoke to her for quite a while.  After speaking with Catalina, Katya was convected that this was the life for her.  The Vampires are big on family, she thought she would fit in quite nicely.  Her big day came when Catalina came to her and told her that the only way for the Vampire family to consider her to be a new addition to their family, was if she renounced the Dervish and vowed her life to them.  And then and only then, would they consider her as a new possible member.  At this time, Katya was still level 15, she told Catalina that it was no problem to renounce the Dervish because she did not belong with them.  At that moment, Katya renounced the Dervish for good.  Doing so killed Katya down to level 5 and took her attributes down to what they were before she joined the Dervish.  At the sight of what Katya had endured to become a part of the Vampire's Catalina decided to invite Katya into the Vampire family right then and there.  Katya was so thrilled!  She could hardly contain herself.  Catalina and two other members of the Vampires, brought Katya over to the dark side.  Katya grew enormously fast in the next few months.  Katya was so happy as a member of the Vampires.  She thought she had finally, found the fight family, and felt that she belonged after years and years of searching realms and different worlds.At this time Katya had become great and powerful 19+16 Vampire.  One day, the Vampire's Warlord came upon them and gave notice to a great change that was going to happen in the near future.  The family was changing, Katya was kind of upset that the family and way of life, that she grew to love, was going to be changed.  But, she put up her chin and took a deep breathe and carried on.  After this new change happened, Katya did not like these changes.  She did not feel like she was at home anymore, like her home was taken away and the family had been destroyed. So, after a long time thinking hard and long on this situation, Katya left the family and went out into the world once again, to discover a new home, one that would not change and the values of life would not dissipate. Katya still being 19+16 searched all over the world for a new home.  She found many different types of clans, families and worlds, none of which met her needs for a new home.  Katya had been all alone for very long time.  She ventured around for many, many years, until one day she heard someone speak of this new group of people who were gathering.  Katya was very interested in all of what she heard, so she sought out all who knew about these new lands.  She spoke to one who guided her to a huge tower in a far off land that she had never traveled before.  After coming up to this large tower, Katya slowly went inside to speak with the Master of this great tower.  After speaking with this master, she decided that this might be where she belonged.  After carefully considering all her opinions, Katya joined with this Master and became a Warrior Monk.  She pledged to keep all innocent from harms way and to banish all evil to the eternal darkness.By the time Katya had reached level 19+17 and was very strong in her new found home.  The Master of the great towers disappeared.  Everyone who served him searched every part of the realm and far off lands, no one could find him.  So, once again, Katya was homeless, had no family to call her own, and once again, she is out in the world looking for a new beginning.One day, Katya was traveling off the beaten path and came to an old man who handed Katya a scroll.  As she read the scroll she found out about a clan of Bards that were camped out at Ryllian.  Katya then traveled across the lands and finally reached Ryllian.  She tried to find someone, anyone to speak to about this new clan.  But, she could not find anyone.  Many days had past before a young man came along in the morning light.  Katya was surprised to see him when she awoke, he knew quite a bit about the Bards.  He sent her to find Star, who was one of the Bard leaders of this group of Bards.  He gave her all the information that he could at that time.  Katya thanked him and went on her way, searching for Star.She traveled for days on end searching for this woman, Star.  When she almost gave up, Katya came upon a small village green and was excited to find out, there was Star.  She went up to Star and spoke to her about the Bards.  Star told her that they were happy and kind folk, who enjoy playing instruments, singing and dancing.  "Very social people Bards are", she said.  Katya had no doubts of who she wanted to be, what she wanted to become.  Katya asked Star to help her become on of these happy Bards.  Star guided her back to Ryllian and brought her into the Bard's home and gave her a tour.  Star granted Katya's wishes and blessed her with becoming a Bard.  Now Katya was so happy.  She danced and sang with joy.Now Katya is almost 19+20, very happy being a Bard, and is happily married to her beloved, Catacomb.  And has grown nicely in her new family and hopefully this will be the last venture she will ever have to take alone.**Data was born 21 years ago in a quiet little town. The doctors had told his mother she couldn't have kids, but Data came anyways. At this time, Data was viewed as an accident, his own parents, not caring what happens to him. When at last he reached the age of 5, his parents took him to an ally, and left him there. They walked away, without looking bad, or shedding a single tear. Data sat there...alone for the first time in his life. During this time, he learned how to feed himself, and avoid dangerous people. One day, he passed by some kind of dojo and watched...little did he know that by watching these people would lead him to his destinee. As time grew on, Data traveled many lands, and 15 years later from that dismal day did he find his new home. He was amazed at the people of this land, and soon decided that this is what he will call home for the rest of his life. One day he saw a group of people, with metal covering their bodies, attacking their enemy, and defending their honor. Data has never been apart of a group before, or a family, so he questioned one by the name of Summer about them, asked about their way of life, goals, structure, and how they are as a group. Summer had to think of a task for him, but gave him her requirements for the guild. At this time, he had a friend, a very good friend by the name of Desiree, she helped him get his stats up and coins. Little did little Data know that The Cyberninja's did not like the Templar. When Summer gave him her task, he did it, but there was a discussion on if I should be let in or not since I was helped by a templar, so they asked one more thing of Data, to kill a Templar Guard. He did so and was then welcomed into the Cyberninja Family.As time went on, Data learned the arts of the Cyberninja, Mastering their lethal ways, but something wasn't right, Cyberninjas of the old did not like him, and they felt that he should have been like them, not like the new cyberninjas. One day, Data asked a Warrior to make him a title, and by going to a place that was created by the God Boltar, was able to transfer the title to him. When the other Cyberninja's saw this, they did not like his idea, they felt like he didn't earn it. Some of the Cyberninja's he talked to who held a position, felt like he earned it, because he used his head. One such person was Subotai, as well as Puppy, and Konya. But one person did not agree, and posted a rule, that any cyber without an earned title would be dishonored till they changed it. So Data, not liking this at all, decided to call in a favor that he earned from the Might Creator Maledicta. Maledicta not only gave Data the power to have his current title, but also a pretitle, and gave him the power to set it even if Data died, or advanced. So after this was done, the rest of the Cyberninjas left him alone. At around this time, changes were happening, and his sensei Summer wasn't the same person. Summer decided that she no longer held her student close to heart, and put her alliance with the most hated family on the realm, in front of her own family. She told these Shardaks, that she would go renegade just to kill him. Another Cyberninja who held position in the guild, saw this, and immediately punished her. Later on, things got more heated, some cyberninjas went renegade, and others left. The renegades tried to purify the guild, to bring it back from all the bickering that was going on. At around this time Summer left the family, in a dishonorable fashion, little did anyone know that her actions would leave a personal embarrassment as well as a personal dishonor for the rest of his life. Data soon realized that the Cyberninja's were falling apart, and tried his best not to let it happen. Cyberninjas were becomingand fewer in numbers. Data felt alone, his family, falling apart, so we went on a personal quest to find himself someone to love, someone to bear his children. Little did he know that he would find her so quick. The next day, he went to say goodbye to a friend of his, and told her that he was going to look for a wife. His friend spoke up, and told him he didn't need to look far, that she knew of someone who was also looking. Data's friend then introduced the two to each other. Soon, the two fell in love, and got married, and had children, Atrocious, and her sister Nala. More children came later in their lives. After Data and Atrocity's marriage, the Master Sensei named Dune came back, and re taught his student Cyberninja's, as well as bringing back superior weapons and defense items. Soon the Cyberninja's were brought back together. At this time, Data felt that he could better help his friends and family, if he was accepted as one of the Gods of the lands. Data looked into the matter, read old scrolls and found out that there were "quests" that had to be done in order to become one of them. Data worked long and hard, and sometimes, his family needed his help with money, and knowledge. This slowed him down, but he felt that it was better to help people when they needed help, rather than putting it off for another person to take up. It was his responsibility to help his family when in need. Soon, the most hated family on the game, the Shardaks,  started stabbing their Cyberninja allies in the back, and therefore creating a family war. Data was hard pressed as members needed help in getting money and heals, but he never gave up hope. After the war died down some, he continued his quest, as he had only a few remaining, he was soon able to defeat two of these quests, leaving only one remaining. Only one quest remained that he could do, but only a very select few people have done, che Icingdeath quest. Data fought like he never has before, with a family member named Orb helping him by assisting Data kill a few monsters. When at last, they got what they needed, it was time to kill the all powerful Icingdeath. Data fought fast and furious, and with Orb watching his back, they killed the mighty icingdeath. It was time that Data moved on with his life, but there was one last thing on his mind.he had heard of a very powerful creature, something that was feared, and he wondered why, Data had plenty of heals to waste, and so went to this creature. When he attacked it, he found out why it was feared, and told his friend Orb. Soon they were both at it, fighting this monster which everyone feared, the battle was long, but they finally slayed this monster. After all this work, Data goes off into the country with his beloved wife, and lays down under a tree and they both fall asleep in each other's arms. While Data sleeps, he dreams, and in these dreams, he met the Great God Boltar. Boltar tells Data what he is to do, to become one of them, they talk briefly, and he asked Boltar questions. Boltar answered all of Data's questions and left. When Data awoke, he looked down at his wife still sleeping, snuggling his chest. Data smiled, and finally knew where his heart belonged, that it isn't that he helped people who were in need of help, either with money, or knowledge, it was the friendship he gave them, his love. His bond to his friends was so great, that when he was at last granted the powers of the God he continued to care about his friends, and he still loved his wife. It is said that they are still together, that nothing has changed between them, they continue spending time together underneath that tree, sleeping in each other's arms, with their children, playing in the meadow. Data will never be forgotten, as long as those who care about him keep him in their hearts. This story was written by Vodka, I have had the deepest honor, and satisfaction of telling this person's life. ** Atrocity was brought to this world when she needed to have a little more excitement! Once Atrocity was big enough, she joined the warrior guild.  After a semi-short time period, Atrocity decided the warriors were definitely NOT for her.  Atrocity just could not get into the theme of the Warriors.  So, she decided to leave the warriors and search for her true self. Once she found who she was within, she looked around to see who was right for her...which group of people did she belong with and who belonged with her?  It was definitely NOT the evil people...Atrocity decided ninjas and shardaks and  the likes were not for her, but while searching for her place, she met a wonderfal man.  While this man was part of one of the groups she felt she did not belong with, he was different on an individual level.  He is sweet and gentle and caring. He has helped  Atrocity in her quest for gaining knowledge about the land of Nirvana.  Shortly after  meeting this man, Atrocity was asked to be the wife of Data. Almost immediately Data and Atrocity were married.  They have 6 beautiful children and at the time of this  posting, Atrocity is pregnant with their seventh child. These children will show the land of Nirvana that good and evil can exist among each other and can even embrace one another in a bond of love.  While Atrocity has had her knowledgable husband there to show her various things, she has also learned quite a bit on her own, especially doing each trial that is needed    to master the Bards. Atrocity really found her calling when she was welcomed into  the Bards. She has been able to show her creative and artistic side without being  mocked or shunned, instead she has been welcomed with open arms. Atrocity is  celebrating the joy of being a Bard and can't wait until she is able to be a wonderful  role model for other Bards and prospective Bard recruits.**   My story begins not too long ago, when I joined the lands of Nirvana.  I came here as an utter novice, having no knowledge of strengths or powers and not knowing where my adventures may lead me.  I wandered the realms searching for my place, I heardonce from a group chatting that a guild of Paladins may be coming to a near by realm.  From what I heard from the gentlemen, I thought that I would search out more information about them.Soon after my search began, I heard that they had decided to postpone coming to any of the realms in Nirvana, at this time.   As time past, I wandered the realms learning all that I could about everything that was here.  One day, I wandered into the green and a nice young man was there.  He gracefully kissed my hand and introduced himself, as Danilo, a Bard.  At this timeI was unsure what a Bard exactly was.  We had spoke for sometime,about a little of everything.  As time went on, I grew very interested in the Bards.  Speaking with Danilo, he had mentionedthat I should seek out Star, who was the GC for the Bards, to find out more information about them and how to become a bard, if I so wished at the time.   While in search of Star, I had met up with Danilo a few different times, eventually got very attached to him.  On March 3, Danilo had married.  Shortly after marrying Danilo, I finally caught up with Star and inquired about the Bards.  Once everything was said about what is expected of a new Bard member, I requested to be allowed to join.  Star graciously recruited me in to the group.     As of now, I am still married to Danilo, we currently have a totalof 6 children.  I am love being a Bard, it is like I finally found home.**    A long, long time ago on the island of Cahara there lived a darkpriest.  He went by the name 'Daragor'.

His life was built on discipline, order and most importantly honor. His recognition as a Child of Light was legendary. His great victorys against the raging Evils of the land were well known and recorded. His allegiance to God and king were unquestioned. He fought for those who could not fight for themselves. He was a vision to behold in those days. At the age of 28, Jaryn found he was not just a soldier of God, he was a man in love.His attentions were noticed by a local burgomasters daughter. Her name was Aliza. A rose in the oasis of the desert she was. Beautiful and graceful were the lines of her body, yet the gentle breeze was her voice as she spoke his name the day he rode into town. They were to be married at summers end that year. Jaryn's life was forever changed that awful summer.His dutys took him away from Aliza from time to time. Life was harsh without her by his side, but his faith drove him onward. A war cought him defending his nations standards, when word came to him deserters had broken through and set fire to the very village Aliza and he were set to be married.Forsaking his dutys to his king, he rode all night to have his worst fears realized. The town was in ruin and Aliza was nowhere to be found. Those survivors, battered and broken, rambled to him that she had been taken by the mauraders for her delicate beauty. Ignoring those in need of his aid, he rushed off to find the love he always longed for.Days of tracking led him to a nearby cave hidden among the close mountan range. Rushing within, he confronted the brigands in their lair. He overpowered them, 3, 5, 10 men could not best him.

All that he was, he poured into her, but his powers were unable to repair what had been done.He cried out, cursing his God, cursing himself for leaving her. He grew cold, angry and vengeful. He flew into a blind rage and slit the necks of those who had done this to her. His curse was answered, by whom he could not say. He was transformed then, a thing of madness and bloodthirst. His ideals of honor and nobility remain, yet he is consumed by an unquenchable thirst for blood. His hatred envelops him, creating a dislike for all those not like him.Years have passed since that day, 900 to give a round number for he is not sure the exact date. He has mastered the urges that drove him, yet he is still forever changed by that one moment he lost his faith.He asks me to record this in my history so those who will come after will look upon his mistake and not lose that precious thing we all have....Faith.Recording history as it happens,Zander Telperian **Walking into the lair of the deceiver, Danimal cautiously approached the young girl tied to the pole.  Trying to free her, the girls form blurred and her true form was shown, that was of Loki, also known as the Deceiver.  Approaching Loki slowly he played a soft, soothing song to hinder him.  As the song took its hold, Danimal swiftly charged forward, swinging his Nodachi.As Danimal fought on, his faithful Phoenix Magic launched herself at Loki.  With Magic at his side, they fought the good fight.  He moved too and fro, his katana hitting the Deceiver as he sang to the elements to help.  Rocks, spheres of iron, and the great Sun itself listened to his voice and attacked the Deceiver.  With his words, his katana, his faithful phoenix at his side, and the power of all that is good, Danimal was beating Loki.  He swung the katana into the Deceivers side only to see him look up with horror in his eyes.As Loki's breaths came in short breaths he fell to his knees.  Stepping close to him, Danimal stabbed the Deceiver in the chest, taking his life.  Leaning over the corpse, he grabbed a small ebony orb from around Loki's neck.  Placing the orb in his pocket, he slowly walked away, his body and mind still caught up in the fight he was just in.**Once upon a time in a far away land, a dark elf was born.  The firstchild of the king, and heir to the throne, the birth had been longawaited and was commemorated by a week of festivals throughout thekingdom.  At the end of the week, the new princess was officiallypresented to her people, and her name was announced to the cheeringmasses; Brynna.As Brynna grew, so did her beauty.  Her jet black hair was touched by no scissor or blade by decree of her father's law.  Her eyes though, were startling.  Despite all predictions to the contrary, the ice blue eyes that she was born with never darkened.  They sparkled with joy almost all the time, for Brynna was a happy child.In her father's kingdom, girls were declared women at the age of 15,with much ceremony and celebration.  Brynna's 15h birthday was, ofcourse, unmatched for extravagence.  Her father spared no expense, and invited all the nobles of his kingdom: most especially those with sons between the ages of 16 and 20.  Before the party, Brynna's mother had sat her down for one of those infamous "talks" that all teenagers hate.  This time the talk was about choosing a husband.  Brynna was informedthat she was to make her choice before the age of 16, or her father would make one for her.  He had no other heirs, and would not risk the end of his lineage.When everything was finally ready, Brynna decended the stairs to the waiting guests.  The first dance was with her father, as custom decreed, but once it was over, Brynna was mobbed with requests from the sons of the nobles in attendance.  Everyone wanted a dance with the princess in the hopes she would choose him as her husband, and the next king.  After three hours of dancing without end, Brynna excused herself politely and slipped into a castle alcove to sit down for a moment.  Shortly after she entered, she was surprised by a visitor.  Another elf, though not dark like herself.  Brynna recognized him as one of the stable boys, Dalanar.  They talked for half an hour and really got along well.  Brynna made plans to meet Dalanar for a ride the next day, and returned to her party.After lunch the next day, Brynna headed for the stables for her afternoon ride.  Dalanar was there, as promised, and had arranged to be the one to escort her that day.  They rode together through the valleys and fields of her father's kingdom for hours, becoming closer as they talked.  They agreed to do it again on the following day, and as the days melted into weeks, and the weeks into months, Brynna and Dalanar fell in love.  During this happy time, the Queen again became pregnant.  Brynna was happy at the prospect of a baby in the castle, and never once guessed what it might mean to her future.As Brynna's 16th birthday drew near, the two lovers became desperate.  It was obvious to them both that the King would never smile upon their love.  Not only was Dalanar nothing more than a stable boy, he was also not a dark elf, and the King would never have his bloodline tainted.  They tried making plans to run away, but since Brynna had not yet chosen a husband, the King was in the process of choosing one for her.  Knowing that she would likely object to his choice, he had placed guards on her.Finally, the two lovers realized they had no choice.  They had to tell the truth, whatever the cost.  In order to further convince her father of her resolve to have no one but Dalanar, Brynna planned to tell him that she was pregnant, and therefore too spoiled for any noble's son.  The plan did not go well.  Brynna was used to every male in the kingdom melting under her ice blue eyes, and giving in to her every request.  Even her father could normally be counted on to do so, but not this time.  With tears in his eyes he disowned Brynna and decreed the unborn second child as his official heir.  Dalanar was executed in the courtyard as Brynna screamed her protests.  And as for Brynna, she was ordered exiled, and the tips of her ears cut off to show her disgrace to the world.  The Queen was excused from that part of the proceedings for fear of what the emotional stress would do to the unborn heir, but the King stayed to watch, stone-faced and cold.After it was over Brynna left the castle.  She had been allowed to take nothing but the clothes on her back.  Bleeding and crying she crested the hill outside the gate and took one look back at the only home she had ever known.  She resolutely walked down the hill, knowing that she had no choice now but to make it on her own.  The people of her father's kingdom would spit on her and turn away if they saw her.After months of travel, filthy, hungry, and dressed in rags, Brynna came upon a musician in a land far from her home.  Having always loved music, and having been schooled by the best her father could hire, Brynna sat to listen to him play.  She closed her eyes and tried to pretend she was in her father's throne room again.  When she opened them, she was crying.  The musician was concerned, and took Brynna under his wing, feeding her and initiating her into the Bardic guild of Ryllian.  Now Brynna has a family again, of sorts, and helps them to fight the evil in the land.  She has married, and a is new mother, but will never forget her first love.  And no one ever sees her ears...**Amid the chaos of cyberspace is a land called Nirvana, a place where peopleof all shapes, sizes, sexes, creeds and levels of oddness gather toadventure, learn and more importantly, meet and greet their fellow man.I, Wolfsbane, first journeyed into this land many moons ago, andbeheld this land with awe and wonderment. I journeyed far and met people from many lands. I also met the people within the land of Nirvana, such as Johnathin de Oro, our friendly neighborhood swashbuckling bard, as well as Leo the Archwizard, who was so kind as to grant me the completion of my first quest. The legion of monsters, animals and sundry local characters never fail to provide asource of amusement, challenges and knowledge.And like all visitors to Nirvana, I sought out a group of people whom I could call kin, a group to which I could belong. I searched high and low, over hill and dale, climbed the highest mountains and swam the deepest seas, and could not find a group that felt right. Until one day I met a Bard; I am sad to say that I cannot recall that particular Bard's name, as it WAS a long time ago, but anyway that Bard felt like family and I knew I had found my home. Don't get me wrong, I love all the people in Nirvana, whether they be Bard, Vampire, Dervish or what have you, because we come as we are to this place and continue to learn from each other to make Nirvana what it is. Other duties drew me away from Nirvana for a period of some odd years, but a familiar longing began to stir within me and again I sought out the sanctuary that only Nirvana could provide. I thought my fellow Bards had forgotten me, as when I returned I found myself guildless. It so happens that some kind Bards welcomed me into their fold, and a few even recalled my name from days long past. And to them I am forever grateful, as once again, I am home.**Once, long ago Balyn the small fighter roamed the fieldsof Nirvana, not knowing where he was going or what he wasto encounter. He traveled to learn and reposit knowledgefor further use- not to better himself physically. Thatwould come later.Balyn stumbled through a mysterious portal into a swirlingvortex. Around all sides of him he saw Nature in its purestessence- fields of snowflakes and animated snowmen, thedeserts of the burning sandstorm, the beaches of the arctic.He approached the mountain first, spiraling high abovethe clouds past an old wizard and an odd octopus of ice.At the apex of the dark mountain, his eyes fell upon adark snowbeast- some kind of Guardian demon that seemedto protect a portal. Upon further investigation, it seemedas though the Guardian was nothing more than a creaturewho hadn't the slightest aggression in its heart. Withthis in mind, Balyn strided through the portal to seewhat other creatures he could embrace and learn about.Balyn stepped through the icy portal to be greeted withthe talons of the Guardian's brother- a fellow demon ofice. The cold-blue claws ripped and tore through Balyn'sflesh until he was forced to flee.Unfortunately, Balyn fled north, directly into the waitingmaw of a snow demon. Plagued with excruciating pain andwithout any equipment to protect him in his battle, theyoung adventurer plunged further into the cavern, not knowingthat this was his real mistake.The depth of the caverns led to a powerful Ogre Mage,gripped in its clutches the legendary SoulEater, a weaponof mysterious power. Flanking the magi were two more ofthe infernal snowbeasts. It was the only glimpse Balyn wasafforded of his surroundings before his body was completelytorn apart and pillaged by the triumvirate of death.Escape impossible, Balyn acquiesced to his fate and diedthe death of a warrior at the hands of his enemies.The Church of Nirvana greeted him with a church prayer.He may have temporarily lost his wealth, but Balyn neverforgot the lesson he learned that day- in the unknown,power is necessary to adventure.**Softwind is a Native American that enjoys songs, dance, stories and music. She joined the Bards for this reason.One night she asked Kezef, who is a ranger, for some help killing some monsters that were terrorizing Angel Grove Park. They enter the park and were attacked by Soccerdillo. Now Soccerdillo is an insane armidillo like creature that likes to turn people into soccerballs. Keeping a cool head we advanced and laid the smackth down. We made short work of this weak creature.Next on our agenda was the powerful Goldar. Which in spite of the fact that he looks like a gaint monkey with wings, he was actually quite powerful. He had a tendancy to fly into the air and dive bomb my friend Kezef. I found out when he flies into the air all I need to do is play my bagpipes and have a lightning bolt strike him down. After Kezef blasted his smoking fried carcass we moved on and set our sights on Lord Zed.Lord Zed is a very elusive creature. We had to search the wild lands for clues to his location.We were close to giving up until we came upon the famed Morei Oshi. He told us that Lord Zed's lair was quite close to where we were. All we needed to do was enter the cave to seek him out.;   We entered this dank cave and followed its winding path deep within the mountain until we came to a glowing portal. Drawing a deep breathe we passed into Zed's lair. Now Zed's hard to describe, he's big,red and UGLY. He also likes to hold a staff with a big Z on top. We went on the offensive, but his power was too much until Kezef called out," Metalic Armor, power up" and also "Power Kali Sticks." He began fighting Zed with more vigor than before. His final blow smashed into Zed almost decapitating him. He drew his blaster and vaporized Zed's body until only his staff remained.;The End **The trials of the faeries can be dangerous yet no one knows it is an illusion but when you see it, it will not be, i was dead scared of what might happen when i take it yet i do no fear it, i run head first for a challenge which i know i can take and i run with fear for i know this will be cake,so this is my story about how i prepare for something i have been unawarenow i go into the darkness unware of what i might face but i know i will ace**Once upon this dream I dared to dance with you.To the trees I listened while the winds blew.Merrily we sang and vastly we grew...Up and into one, me and you.I am Autumn, your sister - your kin.Once upon a darkened stone I walked,and on a narrow path I skipped,but do not fail to recall...everyone is bound to fall.No more shall blindness lead the way,A bard forever, if I may.**Born in a small village bordered on chaos and tribulationa young boy grew into a fierce 'warrior'.

This was a time of peace and happiness. The Gods were content with all their mighty doings and enjoyed watching things progress. But alas, as with everything, the Gods soon bored with the same old thing century after century. There was much chaos that ran through the lands as the Gods struggled to entertain themselfs.Until one God descended secretly from the heavens in order to seek some entertainment. Of coarse, disquised as a mere mortal he was. All around the land, he played tricks and sought out ammusement with the creatures of the land. This lasted quite a length of time before the Gods in the heavens became curious. You see, it was not odd at all for those times when a God was to go missing for a while. Every God that exsisted had dissappeared just like this. But never this long.. there was something amiss this time. This had turned to be an absence too long even for the Gods most known for dissappearing. And in the continueous chaos, none of them had even noticed what had happened. None of them even knew the impact, until it was too late.You see, up until that point mortals lived their lives in peace. They were mostly left blind as to the workings of the Gods. Every day, odd things would occour, or miricles would happen, but to the mortals of the land this was normal. Every day, just like the last. But now, now there was a God among them. After a long while of playing, the day came that he got bored living down with the mortals as well. Only the best of times did he seek. That is when his plan came to him. A plan so clever and so wise. Why, it would provide ammusement for him for years! Now, I must note that when I say years, I mean God years of coarse. Quite the difference that isfor a God's year is quite significantly larger than 10 of men's entire lifes put together. Anyways, where was I? Oh yes.. the event. The most magnificent plan that would ever come into creation..In retrospect, it was quite simple of a plan. The God was quite ammused that he was the first to think of it. But then, he was the first to go down for so long into the mortal world.. He started upon the plan at once. It would be quite the task though, for things needed to be set just right, or it would not have the affect he wanted. And alas, he needed something special involved to achieve this plan. Something quite special indeed, and yet hidden even to the Gods themselves.You see, Gods of that time were able to bestow powers to the mortals. It was a gift every God knew about, but there were limitations to this power. Oh, none that actually existed really, but you must understand that even the Gods are not absolutly perfect. It's just that as far away as we are, we simply see them as that way. No, their limitations to this ability was only that of imagination. But the God down in the mortal world, well, he was able to see this plan right in front of his own two eyes because he was down there for so long.I must tell you right now, that the description may lack some details. That, I'm sure of. But then that's what you get when you perform a trick so good even the Gods are fooled. The "Mortal God" was able to bestow upon the lands a new gift. It was that of the mind. After the bestowment, the people of the land actually had some control over the heavens. Beliefs were formed, and the Gods noticed changes in the Heavens. Thus began the great commotion. Gods themselfs started fading away. So they did what they had to to survive. Each God had to start their influence on the mortal world to gain believers. For it was now the belief of the mortals that kept them alive. Yes, as legend has it this is true, we now control which Gods exist, and which vanish. And thus Religions rose, the knowledge of Gods came down to the mortals, and the wars began.- Brak**bright as day banishing lightmorning breaks ending the nightwarmth it brings with comming spring**What if there were a poem that could save a life?would you write it?Or would you let it fade from your mind,Never to be remembered again?What if there were a saying,What is said to often,Or has not meaning to that you can understand,That could change how you feel...Would you say it?If there was a piece of advice,That you think no one cares about,That could change the world,Or even a soul...Would you say it?or forget it forever?If there were a life that you are supposed to save,Only you can save,would you?If you were the only one that could save a love, would you?Or would you let it die?What woulpd you do if you were the only one to save these kinds of things?Little or big everything needs someone to save it,Everything has a meaning...Everyone has a meaning...So what if you were that someone.Would you?**     Many years ago, in the streets of Ryllian, a nameless young orphaned boy struggled to survive.  Stealing food and clothing from the merchants of the town in order to survive, the young street urchin quickly learned how to fend for himself.  He discovered early on that people liked to hear him sing, and some would even offer him gifts of food or clothing if he would sing for them.  But, even though he had the voice of an angel, the merchants would not willingly part with enough of their wares for him to keep his belly filled purely by song.  As a necessity for survival, he had to continue stealing what he needed.       As the years went by, the boy grew to a young man, and became bolder and more blatant in his thievery.  Instead of only stealing clothes and food, he began picking the pockets of visitors and running scams to con them out of their coins.       One day, as he was watching several new faces mull about in the market area, he spied a woman dressed in a brightly colored tunic. The condition of her clothes and the size of her coin purse convinced him that she would be his next target.  As he watched her mull about the marketplace, he could not help but admire the way her legs and hips filled out her leather pants.  He had been noticing such things more and more lately, but regarded them as nothing more than distractions.  Through force of will, he forced those thoughts out of his mind in order to concentrate on the task at hand.       As he made his way toward his target, he saw his opening and quickly reached to relieve her of the burden of her hefty coin purse while her back was to him. Just before he could get his fingers around the leather pouch, she said in a loud, clear voice without turning around, "That would not be so wise, my young friend."     He quickly turned to run as several heads in the crowd wheeled in his direction, but before he could take a single step away, the strong hand of a town guard had him by the collar and was forcefully turning him back to face his would-be victim.  "Get back here, you.  Youre not getting away this time," the guards gruff voice rumbled.     As he was struggled to free himself from the guards iron grip, the woman turned to face him and his will to escape completely left him. From afar, she had appeared rather shapely and attractive, but coming face-to-face with her had made him realize just how stunningly beautiful she truly was.       "Just say the word, mlady, and well see to it that the no-good cur gets what he deserves, " spat the guard.     Her eyes fixed on those of the young man, a hint of amusement dancing within them, as she studied him a moment.  Finally, she looked to the guard and said, "I dont think that will be necessary."     Furious, the guard shouted, "But he must be punished!  We cant abide this behavior!"     She turned her gaze back upon the young man, a slight smirk accentuating the smile still in her eyes, as she calmly said, "Release him to my custody, and I will ensure that he pays a...proper penance.  Yes, when I am finished with him, he will be completely reformed. A new man, you might say."     "Have it your way then," the guard grumbled. Then to the young man he growled, "Heed my words lad. If I catch you thieving in this town again, not even she will save you from my wrath!" And with that he stormed off into the crowd.     Silently, the woman motioned for her new charge to follow her. Still stricken by the beauty of this woman as well as the events that had just transpired, he found himself obeying without a second thought as she led him out of the market and away from the town. As they walked, she asked, "What is your name?"     "I do not know," he replied truthfully.     Perplexed, she pressed, "Well, what do they call you?"     "Boy," came his response.     "Oh, that will never do," came her reply.  "We shall just have to give you a proper name, one that fits you and lets people know who you are.  This will take some time of course."      And so it was that she took him under her wing and began to teach him the ways of the Bard.  Throughout their travels she taught him an appreciation for music as well as fine wine, food and clothing. She also took him into her bed, taking him as a lover.  This turned out to be an integral part of his Bard training, though he was unaware at the time, as the lessons she taught with her body beneath the covers would directly influence his music. She taught him to manipulate her body as though he were playing a musical instrument, his ministrations evoking a symphony of ecstasy from her.  She then showed how those same tender caresses could be used to elicit similarly beautiful melodies from various instruments.      She also taught him new and better ways to harness his extraordinary voice in song. He learned the lyrics and melodies of rowdy drinking songs to rouse the blood, ballads so beautiful and heartfelt as to cause fair maidens to swoon, and songs of lamentation and loss so heart-wrenching as to bring grown men to their knees in tears.  With such songs at his disposal, he quickly learned he was able to evoke any emotion he wanted in an audience.     Then one fine spring morning, she called him to her side and presented him with a finely crafted lute. The exquisite polished instrument gleamed in the spring sunlight and when he played a quick tune to test its sound, he found that to be just as exquisite. Under his lover and mentors tutelage he eventually learned to play numerous musical instruments, but he particularly excelled at the lute, as he cherished her gift above all other instruments.      She also presented him with a finely sewn white handkerchief with the name Percival sewn into one corner. "Who is Percival?" he asked.     "You are," came her reply.  "That is your new name, lover.  It suits the person you have become perfectly."  As she spoke, she demonstrated how to fold the handkerchief and stuffed it into the outer breast pocket of his tunic, a triangle of the white fabric neatly exposed above the top of the pocket, adding a touch of class and sophistication.     Then came the day that he had secretly been dreading.  As they lay in each others arms that crisp Autumn eve,  his lover and mentor softly said "I should be moving on in the morning."     He started to ask where they would be off to, but then realized that she had said I, not We.     Seeing the distraught expression on his face, she placed a hand gently on his cheek and softly whispered, "I have taught you all that I can, love. If you are to become a true Bard, then you must return to Ryllian and study at the guild hall.  You are ready and my path leads down a different road."     As he began to protest, she tenderly placed a finger over his lips, silencing him. "Shhh, lover," she cooed. "As this is our last night together, let us make it a memorable one."     Realizing that there would be no negotiating, he resigned himself to the inevitable and resolved to make the night one the would both remember for the rest of their lives.  And they both did just that until the dreaded cold Autumn sun poked its head into the tent.      He awoke to find himself alone for the first time in the two years since their affair had begun.  After a lengthy pause to compose himself, he packed his belongings and set off to return to Ryllian, the place of his birth, and metaphorically, of his death. He was certain once he arrived, it would also be the place of his rebirth.**Far from the Realms of Magic known as Nirvana, is a place of heavily forested woodlandsand within these lands are numerous settlements.  Life is never easy for those that dwellthere.  For the forests are populated with all manner of dark beasts.  The settlements are not without protection, there are a great many knightly orders which protect eachone and in turn the settlements provide recruits, foodstuffs and materials so the orderscan continue on.  This grim foreboding land is known as Kaliban.In a remote part of Kaliban sits the village of Endriago, nestled near a mountain fortressof the Knights of Lupus.  Endriago is a shunned place.  Few visit it for trade and evenless would willingly travel the long routes to get there.  The Knights of Lupus' fortressstands sentinel over the village.  The symbiotic relationship is not lost as one prospersso does the other.  Enter into this setting a lone knight and his quest, a quest to findand rid the lands of a rare but deadly Kalibanite Lion.The lion, if such a thing can be called one, is a great beast.  It resembles a lion inthat it has four legs, a tail, and a great mane.  But the similarities end there.  Theskin of the beast is scaled like a snake, and silver colored.  The tail is barbed and vicious.  The 'mane' is a seemingly endless mass of razor sharp blade like  protrustions.That is not to say that is the only parts of the beast that are deadly.  It also possessmassive claws that can easily rend platemail as if it were paper, and it also sports amouth of sharp teeth and a pair of large fangs, akin to a saber toothed tiger.  It is abeast with one singular purpose, to kill.Endriago had been suffering the predations of this beast for some time, endless pleas hadbeen sent to the Knights of Lupus, but to no avail. the knights had grown haughty and nowlooked down on the village they once protected.  The villagers were scared, they couldnot tend the meagre fields outside the village or gather wood or supplies for the lionwould always strike and slay all it caught.  But all within the Knights of Lupus were notturning a deaf ear to the plight of Endriago.  One such knight had more then just knightlyhonor and duty at stake there.  For within the village resided his bride-to-be, Rebekah.Like most of those in Kaliban, she had a mantle of black hair, though her features werestrangely untouched by the hardships of daily living there, and were as pure and innocentas if they had never known a single day of adversity.  He loved her so dearly and sworean oath to rid the lands of the beast.That very morning, in a full suit of armor, his blade at his side, a favor of his maidfair, tucked into his belt.  He set off to challenge the great beast and end it once andfor all.  Strangely though as he rode out upon his steed, there as no sign of the Lionthe forests were silent, not even the winds were blowing.  The knight was not at-ease forit was an ill omen.  Many days he searched for the beast, but to no avail, and his supplieswere beginning to run out, and he would be forced back to the village to gather suppliesand start out again.  He stopped, something up ahead grabbed his attention, though whathe saw was not a beast, but a diminutive figure in a dark brown supplice that shroudedit from head to toe, the head was bent down, and hands were tucked into the sleeves. Itwas one of the enigmatic 'Watchers in the Dark'.  Beings that were not fully understoodand often only appeared when something dire was about to transpire.The knight made to draw his blade, but his arm would not obey his mental commands.  He was literally frozen in place.  "W-what do you want with me?"  he managed to stammer out.A soft, yet meaning voice entered his head.  "You seek that which others before have alltried to find, and yet met the same fate.  You are not ment to slay it, nor could you.Your village is defenseless and you have left them so.""N-n-no! I do this to save them!""N-n-no! I do this to save them!""Do you really?  Then why has it been attacked and razed?""You lie!" He roared, though his words lacked conviction.He blinked and the watcher was gone.  Cold dread gripped his heart in tightening bandslike a vice.  He turned his horse about and set off at a full gallop riding with all possible speed toward Endriago.He could smell smoke in the air, and after riding hard his horse collapsed with the treeline in sight.  He lept from the saddle and ran in a near panic towards his villagebut what he saw, shattered his heart.  The village was a smoking ruin.  charred bodieslittered the ground.  No beast could have done this, and he saw that the bodies bore signs of arrows, maces and blades upon them.  His very own knightly order had done thisterrible thing.  Frantically he searched the rubble, as if swimming in burnt timbers andash, he made his way towards his beloved's home, offering up prayers to any gods that maybe listening.  But it was to no avail, her house like all the others were a charred ruin.But even worse was another grisly sigh that greeted him.  A large wooden stake had beenerected there, and bound to it was the burnt remains of his dear Rebekah, and carvedinto her head was the words 'Witch'.  Anguish like he had never felt overwhelmed him andhe fell to the ground, in anguish.  A dark shadow passed over him swallowing him up."Mikael... knight of lupus... everything you know, everything you hold dear is dead.""You failed your duty to them.  You failed in your oath.  Your order has taken your loveand branded her.""You are dead to them now, and only an ope grave awaits you there."These words came to his mind, not from an outsider, but from himself.  He tore off hisknightly vestments and armor and threw them aside.  Spitting curses and wrath to the veryheavens his anguish knew no succor.  He was dead to everyone he knew here, and now all he had left was his name, and even that he now forsook.  No longer Sir Mikael of Lupushe now donned the ancient title of Cypher.  Never again to utter his name and to alwaysremember his past but to travel abroad telling not of his past, and to hopefully findthe peace he so desperately seeks.**My eyes felt heavy and laden with sleep as I yawned and awoke.  This wasn't my bed, this was not even my bedroom.I had awakened in a strange bedroom.The room was richly decorated with expensive furniture.  There were paintings on the walls displaying an assortment of distinguised men.I recognized none of them, yet I felt as though I should.Standing, I stretched, yawned and of course like all men, I had to scratch certain areas I won't mention here.Walking to the door, I opened it and stepped out.  A very large man in a dark blue suit stood just outside the door.He said, "Good morning, Mr. President."With that my eyes popped open. Sighing, I murmured, "Just a dream."**A familiar chill permeated the air, and Fitz looked up, to find himselfstaring into the familiar but still disgusting face of a Myrddraal.  "Yourealize," he said with his customary grin, "that this is totally unfair,right?  We won the last battle.  There shouldn't be any more Shadowspawn."The halfman, with its kind's customary lack of humor, merely hissed."Fffffinally....  one of the so-called Heroes is alone....  helplesssssss."It blurred slightly, and its sword was in its hand.Fitz'z left hand dashed inside his fancy Cairhienin coat, pulling out oneof many knives he refused to give up, and threw it at the Mydraal, butthe creature's drawn sword picked it out of the air, with no furtherreaction than a contemptuous hiss."That would have worked once, you know," Fitz bantered, circling awkwardlyon his half-crippled legs, his blue crystal cane keeping him steady.  "Youdon't have any eyes, but a dagger through the eye socket still kills a Fade."The fade hissed, raising its blade and stepping forward.  "You know what theworst thing about you fades is?" Fitz asked, leaning to the side with thespeed of a man half his age to dodge a testing strike.  "No sense of humor.My quips are my best thing, and they completely wasted."The Fade struck out again, and Fitz reversed the dagger, raising it to block,only to draw his hand back, swearing furiously, when a cunning turn of thesword made the blade catch his hand, cutting tendons and sending the daggerspinning away in a spurt of blood."Maybe I should have taken your master up on his offer," Fitz said, leapingbackwards.  "If I wasn't getting old, you'd already have joined the dozensof Fades I've killed."Amazingly, the Fade hesitated.  "We could never underssstand why a human wholoved himself so dearly as you wouldn't let himself be turned...." it hissed."Even now, I would be rewarded...."Fitz snorted.  "Oh, I doubt that.  I'm pretty sure helping to reseal hisprison took me out of the running.  Besides, the same reasons as beforeapply.  Myra would NOT approve.  Wolves have absolutely no sense of humorwhere the Dark One is concerned."--------------------------"Myra, love...  " Fitz cajoled, "Look at me.  Please."  His voice gavevery little hint of the fact that he'd been making the same request fornearly an hour.Finally, the beautiful woman standing in front of him raised her tear-stained cheeks, meeting Fitz's eyes, and despite his resolve, he couldn'trestrain a gasp and a flinch on seeing that her sea-blue irises had somehowchanged to golden.  "Myra...  what....?""Oh, this is bad..." she said, a touch of humor showing through her tears."You're actually at a loss for words."Producing a handkerchief with all the overdone pomp of a gleeman, Fitzbegan wiping tears from her cheeks.  His face in a mock scowl, heresponded, "And you're stealing my lines...""So...." Fitz whispered, "Wolves?  The rumors about the golden eyes aretrue?"  He caught her chin, keeping her from lowering her eyes again."Yes.  I can hear them.  I can...  feel them.  I run with them in my dreams."Pulling away, she turned, sinking into a crouch and hiding her eyes again.Fitz knelt beside her, slipping an arm around her shoulders.  "It's all right," he whispered softly.  "No wolves are going to take my wife awayfrom me."**The fade hissed again.  "The hunter killed her...  she does not wait foryou in Tel'aran'rhiod...""Oooh, a sadistic lie from a Myrddraal."  Fitz let his cane fall into hisinjured left hand, pulling and throwing a dagger with his right, but to nomore effect than the first.  Dodging the fade's follow-up, he fell, andwas forced to roll several times across the ground before getting his caneback into his good hand, and regaining his feet.The fade glanced down at Fitz's mangled legs, its hissing sounding suspiciously like laughter.  "The Seanchan rewarded you well for betraying your country to them..."Fitz grinned.  "And that might bother me," he said, ducking another swingof the sword, but losing a thin stip of cloth from his coat, "If I'd doneit for a reward."----------------------------------Fitz stood facing the Empress of the Seanchan, his fancy Cairhienin coatlooking like a farmer's work wear.  "You don't know me, Empress, or howrare it is for me to be serious.  Or how hard it is for me to ask this, butI beg you.  Let me help you conquor Cairhien.""You claim to be....  Blood of this land, false though the blood of theselands might be."  The Empress's voice dripped with regal disdain.  "Is itpride, or greed, that makes you betray your land, as have so many beforeyou?"Fitz bowed his head.  "It's neither.  I've visited the lands you've takenhere in the west.  Farmers work their fields.  Children of families whohaven't read since the Breaking learn lessons in your schools.  No onegoes hungry, unless they can work and refuse."Fitz turned, toward a huge map on the wall, and walked toward his land ofCairhien.  "My land is in chaos.  We have no king, and most of the nobleshave become no better than bandits."He turned back toward the Empress, and dropped to his knees.  "I'm betrayingmy land because I love it, Empress.  Because maybe the Seanchan can save it.And I know it well.  I can tell you where to strike, who is still importantto kill or to keep alive.""And," the Empress said icily, "I suppose you think you should be King ofyour newly saved land?"Fitz's eyes bulged for a moment, and then he laughed uproriously.  "I'm...I'm sorry.  I'm doing my best to be serious, but that's funny in so manyways..."**"Not that you care," Fitz told the Fade, "but I'd do it all again, even the torture.  Cairhien is stronger than it's ever been.  We repelled the Shaidowith a minimum of casualties, and the same with the Trollocs who came inthrough the Ways."The Fade was deifnitely laughing at him now, despite general insistence byeveryone that they had no sense of humor.  "So you try to lessen yourmistakes by being proud of them.  Does that make you feel better abouttelling so many secrets to a Friend of the Dark?  Or about what you didto her even before you knew what she was?"Fitz stared at the Fade.  "Who.... or what, are you?"The Fade pressed closer, driving Fitz backwards, forcing him to use hiscrystal cane to parry attacks.  "Do not question me, human...  your pettyand temporary victories do not make you important."Fitz chortled.  "No?  I'd say surviving long enough to help lock up yourmaster is quite the victory.  And Myra was no Darkfriend.  Wolves, remember?They're even more unreasonable than Aiel."The Fade's hissing laughter got stronger.  "The she-wolf was not your onlywife, Fool..."Fitz, unable to help himself, stopped and gaped.  At the last instant, heraised his cane in both hands to block a downward strike of the sword, onlyto have it shatter into thousands of fragments, many of them cutting his faceand arms, and several cutting the Fade as well.Without the cane, Fitz was forced to fall to his knees, his intentionallycrippled legs collapsing under his weight.  "But I told Niobe everything..."His eyes widened.  "I told her about Myra..."The fade loomed over him, its hissing laughter louder and louder, despitethe bleeding cuts from the crystal.  "It was quite a triumph for her when you married her, never knowing she'd arranged for your she-wolf to die."Drawing its left arm back, it struck Fitz across the face, knocking him tothe ground.  The beleagured man spat blood, then grinned.  "Not so muchwhen she left me, I'd imagine...""No...  she was very nearly killed for giving up so valuable a dupe overan affair."  The fade stood over Fitz, its blade at his throat.  "And shewill pay the final price for her failures, soon...""She didn't stop me from helping the Seanchan take Cairhien," Fitz pointedout.  "Drawback of not speaking to me, I guess..."  He flinched, and groanedin pain as the blade twitced, and took him through the shoulder."It is past time for boasting, Fool.  You will gain no further triumphs overmy master.  You betrayed your country.  You betrayed your wife to adarkfriend, and then you married her.  Your intentions make no difference.Your time as a so-called Hero of the Horn is done.  No more will you bewoven back into the pattern."  The Fade raised its blade."Maybe you're right," Fitz said.  "Although if you're right about me beinga Hero, the Dragon did worse things and he's still around.  But you'veforgotten something much more...  immediate."The Fade leaned forward, pushing its blade down with agonizing slowness,piercing directly through Fitz'z breastbone.  "Then tell me, Fool...  ifyou can manage it through the pain."Fitz spat more blood, directly into the Fade's face.  "After High InquisitorTartha, even this is amateur hour...  especially since you've forgottenthat my cane was a ter'angreal.  Did you know it has a use besides helpingto unlock the relics to cage your master?"Hissing with rage, the Fade wiped the blood from its face, then paused,its blade actually touching Fitz'z heart.  "What....  use...?" it asked,almost reluctantly.Groaning with effort and pain, Fitz reached up with both hands to grab the Fade's sword by the blade, ignoring the feel of it slicing into his handsand the blood running down his arms.  "Whe the key's owner dies... itexplodes!"  With a final jerk of his arms, and a final scornful grin, Fitz pulled the Myrdraal's blade down, through his heart.Fitz's arms flopped back to the ground, though his rictus of a grinremained.  Swearing oaths only Myrdraal know, the fade tugged at its sword,having a little trouble getting it back out of the breastbone.Turning, it sought a shadow, only to find that there were none in range.The shards of the cane were glowing, brighter and brighter, until eventhe Fade's unnatural sight was overcome, sending it staggering to its knees."Cursed Fool...." it hissed, as the light consumed it, Fitz's corpse, andspread out to create an enormous sphere.The Seanchan, Andorans, and Aes Sedai all sent investigators to the scene,but there was nothing to find.  The blue light had scoured away all tracesof both Hero and Fade, then receded, leaving nothing behind but a fragile-seeming crystal cane.----------------------------------"And that, my Lords and Ladies," said Fitz, bowing with a flourish, thenstowing his Harp on his back, "Is how I ended my time on the Pattern, andcame to return to the Realms of Magic, which have always been my true home."He lifted and drained his tankard, then bowed deeply.  "And now, if you'llexcuse me, my wife was supposed to meet me here.  I suspect she's beencaught in all this bad weather, and as you've heard, I don't always havethe best of luck hanging onto them."**The sweet, mellow sound of Lyrics lute wove an intricate pattern through the busy chaos of Orins, the melody light and lively in contrast to the darkness of night already blanketing Ryllian.  The chill days of winter offered precious few hours of daylight, and far too many hours of enforced leisure for most of the locals.  Cognizant of how quickly idleness and boredom can turn dark and destructive, Lyric modulated seamlessly into different musical styles while scanning the growing crowd for any sign of trouble.  As her eyes moved around the room for what seemed like the hundredth time that eve, something in the far corner near the drafty front door caught her attention.  Her fingers faltered on the strings as her gaze came to rest on him, and only her countless hours of practice saved her.  It cant be. was her first thought, followed quickly by a simultaneous rush of joy mingled with a hot flash of anger.  Despite her schooled expression, her eyes sparked with emotion as they locked on his, and she had to blink back the tears that threatened to spill out from beneath her lashes.Exhilaration mixed with trepidation filled Lyric as he nodded once in her direction, then began to make his way through the oblivious crowd to where she perched on a stool near the enormous fireplace on the back wall of the common room.  He looked older, his thick, sable hair now sprinkled with the occasional strand of silver, but he still moved with the graceful confidence of years past.  He paused to order a steaming tankard of mulled wine, scarcely bothering to glance at the harried bartender as he tossed a few coins on the worn wood of the bar, then slipped into the sole unoccupied chair near the hearth.  Lyrics heart both ached and skipped a beat as he turned his full attention back to her, the golden glow of the firelight adding a warm cast to his smooth skin and causing amber fires to dance in the depths of his azure eyes.  **Lyric could remember falling headfirst into the depths of those eyes, being surrounded by their brilliant blue and drowning in them.  The sound of his voice, rising and falling as it intertwined with hers in phantom counterpoint to the music spilling from her lute, teased her awareness.  It was the recollection of the music  HIS music - more than anything, that opened the floodgates that held at bay the memories she had so carefully locked away in that secret place inside her mind, hidden and safe from the world.  Stolen moments washed over her  his fingertips gently brushing a strand of hair out of her eyesthe warm, deep sound of his laughter.his fingers tangled with hers as they walked hand in hand, the sun warm on their faces as the breeze teased their hair.the surprising softness of his lips, hot and insistent against hers.his unique, comforting scent surrounding her as he held her close..the feeling of helpless, hopeless desolation when she was parted from him.Lyric was halfway through the chorus of her next song before she realized, with some irritation, that her music had shifted to a minor key, somber and melancholy.  The homey scent of the mulling spices in his mug tickled her nose, and he smiled up at her as she wrinkled it to keep from sneezing.  The sight of his smile made her heart ache, made her feel clumsy and moonstruck, and drew another surprising flash of anger from somewhere deep inside her.  How dare he return now.now, when her heart had finally mended, when she did not spend every day missing him and cursing him and loving him in his absence, when she had finally found her life again?**Lyric began to sing, her voice carrying despite is soft, sweet quality, and weaving itself into complex harmonies with the music of her lute.  She sang of love and loss and the bittersweetness of youth.  He leaned toward her as she sang to him, listening intently, his expression full of life and love and passion, an expression she had longed to see even just one more time.  Knowing it to be a mistake, but unable to help herself, Lyric gazed directly at him and sang, her voice breaking on the last chorus:	Tis better to have loved you	Though my heart will neer mend	Tis better to have known your touch	Though youll not be back again	Tis better to have heard your laugh	Though silence echoes while were apart	Yes, far better to have loved you	Youll live ever in my heartThe tears that had threatened to fall now blurred her vision, spilling through her lashes to cascade unfettered down her cheeks.  As the last haunting notes of the song hung in the air between them, Lyric closed her eyes.  A single involuntary sob escaped her as one last memory forced its way into her mind: the memory of freshly turned earth and a bright spray of wildflowers glistening with her tears.  Her own voice screamed its anguish somewhere in the depths of her mind, shouting NO! to the universe.  The universe did not answer her, and when she finally found the courage to open her eyes, he was gone, leaving Lyric once again utterly alone in the busy winters eve crowd at Orins.**A young journeyman awakens in a field after a long sleep, his eyes slightly blurred as he looks around. The Breeze softly tugs at his hair as the sun warms his skin.He stands up and looks around as he remembers what task he has been sent to do, he ventures down the path in which he began the day before. Walking down the road he reaches into his pack to grab a cool drink from his camelskin.As he ventures down the road he comes across a deep dark forest, fears of the darkness flood his mind as screams and odd noises flood his ears from within the forest.As he takes his first step into the woods he steps on a branch as a loud crack echos through the wooded area as it grows silent of a sudden.A rustling of leaves comes from the right side of him as a small flash of light shoots in front of him and floats around his face. At a closer glance he notices that this is a fairy of the ancient realms.He asks himself could this really be..... is this what really is in front of my eyes right now. As he stretches his hand towards the faerie it seems to lead him through the path of the forest as if to guide him away from danger.Every turn on each side of the darkness growls can be heard as eyes glow in the shadows, stalkers just waiting for the wrong step to end his life with their gnashing teeth.As hours seem to pass he comes to the end of the forest to an enchanted meadow. The faerie slowly drifts down behind a huge mushroom and disappears.As he looks around searching for his ever so blessed guide he looks behind the mushroom in which the faerie went, A mass group of faeries fly up from behind the mushroom and encircle him in dust as he collapses and faints.Soon after awhile he hears singing in the surrounding area which awakens him to the sleep in which was induced by the dust of the faerie magic.Gasping in astonishment, to his eyes what does he see the kirin of ancient myths and tales in which he was sent to take the horn of and bring back to his elder in his small tribe.Seeing the magnificant beauty of this mythical creature he cannot bring himself to kill such a creature as the kirin slowly approaches he freezes in fear.The kirin softly walks up to him and lowers it's head and touch him on  the forehead with his horn. A warmth spreads up his body as he is blessed by the kirin.Reaching to run his hands down the kirins mane, the kirin rolls him on it's back and rides off into the distance taking him to an unknown realm of peace.The Kirin teaches him all of the abilities of nature and balance as he has the connection of telepathy to this creature through the blessing that was given to him.Several years pass as he grows and learns to control and balance his inner powers and powers of nature and the elements,  the kirin finally takes him to the place in which it had taken him from.He takes the journey back home and wanders back into the tribe with no horn in hand. The elder of the village questions him of the horn and why he came back with his task not done....The elder raises his hand to start to cast him from the village as the boy shows his inner powers of nature and magic and the elder collapses in fear as the elder bows to the young journeyman. Becoming the new leader of the tribe he brings balance and peace with people and nature amongst the years to come.**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
