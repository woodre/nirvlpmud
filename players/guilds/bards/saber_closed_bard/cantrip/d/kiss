The cantrip kiss curse is a minor magic of the spheres of enchantment/
alteration.  When this enchantment is placed upon a creature, it becomes 
the carrier of the dreaded frog curse.  From this point on, any person 
that kisses the cursed creature will become a frog.  Not a cantrip for 
the weak of heart or overly affectionate.
