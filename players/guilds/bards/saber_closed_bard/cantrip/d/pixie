The cantrip pixie travel is a minor magic of the sphere of summoning.  With 
the subtle tracing of a rune, the bard summons a single pixie.  The arriving
pixie will take one item (of the bards choice!), and spirit it away through 
the realms of magic.  The pixie will deliver this item to a random player.
