The cantrip tease is a minor magic of the spheres of illusion/enchantment.
When cast, the tease cantrip mixes its influence with an insult in an attempt
to get the target to attacks the caster.  The sharper the wit of the Bard,
the more successful the cantrip.  Useful when trying to attract a monsters
attention away from a comrade.
