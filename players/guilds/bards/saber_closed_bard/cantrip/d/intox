The cantrip intox is a minor magic whose sphere has be often researched.  As 
of yet there is no dominant theory - some argue that it is summoning, others
that it is conjuration, and still others that it is evocation.  (Some just 
say that no decision will ever be reached, since a decision might put an end
to the years of painstaking research done (in the name of science!) on this
rather tasty topic.  These Bards are usually peg'd with baubles.)  Whatever
the sphere, when the runes of this cantrip are traced, the Bard will
immediately become pleasantly intoxicated.
