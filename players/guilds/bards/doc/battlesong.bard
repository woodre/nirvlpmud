The Song of Battle, or Battlesong for short, only works in a
party- and the larger the party, the better!  The magic of
the Song of Battle makes every party member in combat more
effective.

The strength of an individual Bard's Song of Battle depends
on the strength of the Bard's mind, and his or her experience
in the Realms of Magic.
