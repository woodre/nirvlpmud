The Devil's Snare

Rank: 10
Uses: devil_snare
Mana: varies

Summons the Devil's Snare to attack your current
opponent in combat.  The Devil's Snare requires
a Bardic storm to grow, and will wither without
one.  It will also wither if you leave combat.

The strength of the snare (and the amount of mana
used) depends on the strength of your mind and
your experience in the Realms of Magic.
