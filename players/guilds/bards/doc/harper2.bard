  The ensuing chase is the subject of many stories
  and fables, including the famous opera "A Woman
  Scorned."  Finally, in a desperate plea, Harper
  appealed to Crysea for aid.  (Ed. Note: Many 
  bardic lore masters, myself included, speculate
  that it was this instant in which our Cloak spell
  was developed).  Crysea guided Harper to Ryllian,
  City of the Eternal Night and hid him there from
  Hadinea.  In time, Hadinea's rage subsided and she
  made peace with Harper, although the patron of the
  Bard was forever changed to Crysea.  Harper's
  leadership was inspired, if erratic.  Eventually,
  Harper vacated his leadership post to, as he put
  it, "pursue a task of great importance to the
  Bards of Ryllian."  The next morning he was found
  in a hayloft with a massive hangover, but insisted
  he was "just about to begin."  As Harper left
  Ryllian to wanderlust, Saber took over the reigns
  of the guild.
