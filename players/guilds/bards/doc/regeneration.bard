Words of Power: The Rhapsody of Regeneration

Rank: 9
Uses: regeneration
      regeneration <player>
Mana: 100

A potent healing spellsong which grants a mortal
the ability to regenerate much faster than normal-
though it works best for Bards.

A fading regeneration can be strengthened before it
fades completely by performing the spellsong
again.
