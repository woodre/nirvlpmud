Words of Power: The Dirge of Digestion

Rank: 8
Uses: digestion
      digestion <player>
Mana: 100

An odd spellsong which assuages a mortal's belly,
digestion works best for users of Bardic magic.

A fading digestion can be strengthened before it
fades completely by performing the spellsong
again.

Lord Ficke lunged at the minstrel Bosco with a
quick stab from his rapier.  Chuckling as he reached
for his own arm, Bosco tore out another bite from
the mutton shank. "Even if I shall fall to hell,"
he bellowed, "I'll be well-fed before I do."
