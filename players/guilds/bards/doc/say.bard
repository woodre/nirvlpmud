Bard Speech

Bards speak uniquely, and as such when they speak 
people listen.  Your standard speech commands, say and
' have been replaced with the Bard method of speech.
There are some convenctions you should know about
when you speak that will assist you in getting your
point across to other people.  

The standard say defaults to a magenta color and puts
your statements in quotations for a better appearance.

When you put a exclamation point at the end of a
statement it becomes an exclamation and is color
coded red.  Putting three exclamations(!!!) at the
end of a statement makes it a yell and colors it
bright red.

When you put a question mark after a statement it says
that you "ask" and color codes in blue.  Putting three
question marks(???) will change it to wonderment and
color code in bright blue.

Use this knowledge to enhance your communication with
the rest of the MUD.  If you need to speak in the
standard method, use " in place of say or '.  Some
quests outside the guild require a standard form of
communication.
