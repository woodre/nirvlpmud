Leaving the Bards

Rank: 1
Uses: leave_bards
Mana: 0

This command will allow you to forever forsake your
Bardic kin, and the way of Harper.  This will cost
you a significant amount of experience, and you will
never be allowed to join the Bards of Ryllian again.
Be absolutely certain that you know what you are 
doing when you type this command.
