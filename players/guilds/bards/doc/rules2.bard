Bard Rules and Limitations (cont.)

5)  Bards work for the good of the realm.
      Bards are the champions of light, and should
      work for the betterment and good of the realm.
6)  Bards value style over substance.
      Bards are flamboyant and like to show off.  They
      usually value appearance more than actual
      effects.
7)  Bards are social.
      As a bard, it is your DUTY (!!!) to talk a lot,
      hang out a lot and be an all around social
      person. (Have fun!).
