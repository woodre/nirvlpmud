  One of the only current Bards who remember Harper,
  Larenth is elderly, even for an elf.  He retired
  long ago from the adventuring life to dedicate
  himself to the great Bardic Libraries as their
  chief archivist and lore master.  Larenth is also
  a master of divination magic, a talent he uses to
  foresee possible dangers for adventuring Bards.

  Although he is sometimes criticized for being too
  liberal with the scrying practices, Larenth
  insists that supervision is critical to the
  long-term security and safety of the guild as a
  whole.
