Bards can add these special arguments to the Nirvana 'setmon' command:
&dist&  -  Shows disort
&regen& -  Shows Bardic Regeneration
&bat&   -  Shows Battlesong
&digest&-  Shows Bardic Digestion
Add a -b to an option to only show a letter instead of showing the
full word.  For example, &dist-b& shows a D if you have a distort.
If you do not use setmon, the status of these spells shows up
below your prompt instead.
