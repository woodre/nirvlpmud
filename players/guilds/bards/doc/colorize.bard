Bards of Guild level 5 or higher can add ansi color
to say, bt(e) and farsong(e)!  All they have to do
is insert the codes as they type.

Of course it goes without saying that they should
be very careful with this ability, especially when
it affects all the Realms...  Right?

The codes are:
`red`,`green`,`yellow`,`blue`,`purple`,
`cyan`,`black`,`white`,
`RED`,`GREEN`,`YELLOW`,`BLUE`,`PURPLE`,
`CYAN`,`BLACK`,`WHITE`
`bold`, and finally, `off`
