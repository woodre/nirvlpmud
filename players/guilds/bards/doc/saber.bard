  Saber inherited the leadership role of the Bards
  after Harper left to explore new worlds, having
  recently ascended from his vampiric body to join
  the Gods.  Although Saber accomplished a great
  deal of important goals, his single greatest was
  no doubt opening a dimensional rift between the
  city of Ryllian and Nirvana.  The exposure to new
  peoples and new lands to explore was a great boon
  to the guild, and Saber was quick to guide the
  Bards in such a way as to ensure they were always,
  if nothing else, the most stylish group around.
  Saber hand picked the first few generations of
  Bardic leaders to best reflect the principles he
  thought the guild ought to hold dear: Alustryx,
  Devon, Delicate, Alexi, and Mythos are just some
  of the names of lore from this era.
