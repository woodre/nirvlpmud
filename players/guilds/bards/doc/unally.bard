Banish From Alliance

Rank: 10
Uses: unally <player>
Mana: 0

This command allows a Guild Commander to remove a Bard
from the Bard/Knight alliance permantly.  This is to
be used if a Bard's actions run contrary to the 
purpose of the Alliance, but not necessarily contrary
to the purpose of the Bards.  An example of this would
be assisting a Alliance Criminal, an act that is not
necessarily contrary to the Bard laws, but that would
be against the laws of the Alliance.
