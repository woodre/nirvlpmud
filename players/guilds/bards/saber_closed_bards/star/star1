From the quill of Star, Bardic Mistress of the Occult

    Bardic friends, fellow guild members and blessed of Crysea, it behoves 
me in this time of growing shadows to speak to the guild as a whole, that 
you might all understand, and with understanding moderate your actions, as 
to the rise of this new guild/coven of dark magic practitioners.  Normally 
the source of this information would come from the current guild master,
Saber, but as he has been questing, it falls to me, as Occult mistress of
(the Bardic One) (for what he quests I shall write soon, o Bardic friends!)
the Bards, to carry on in his stead.  As has ever been our tradition to
encourage the free flow of information, let me now detail part of my past
    (and let this tradition continue!)
which is relevant to our current situation.  Know that while I am one of 
the original seven, I was not always a bard.  I was born Star, last of the
 (remember them with honor!)
daughters of the Arch Necromancer ________ and first of the seven immortal
             (who by abandoning his name has forbidden me to speak it)
