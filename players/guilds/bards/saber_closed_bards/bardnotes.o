tmp_text "  Welcome, members of the Bardic Guild of Ryllian.We of the first circle of seven welcome you to our guild.This book is to be used for notes, talking, chatting, ideas, ect.  Feelfree to write about stuff you want to see, stuff youwould like changed, or even just stuff you like.And remember.  Have fun!                                          -- Saber**The Bardic Guild of Ryllian was founded by 7 people.Harper:  Founder of the Guild.  Nothing is known of his current location  or condition.Saber:  Current leader of the Guild.  Person to complain to if you  got trouble or can't figure something out.Johnathin de Oro: Master spy of the Guild.  Johnathin knows almost all there is to   know about the city of Ryllian.Star: Occult and Lore mistress of the Guild.  She is rumored to have been  a magi before joining the guild.Laura: Quartermistress of the Guild.  She will sell you bardic items, and  can store equipment for you.Tuyen:  Song Mistress of the Guild.  Her duty deals with the preservation  of music.The final founding Bard is the one whose name may not be mentioned.**Ok, I need those of you with special titles to mail me them.I will put them into the guild proper, so that you don't loose them whenyou die, or when you advance a level.  For those of you wondering about all this, you get a special bardictitle if you find a bug in the guild AND TELL ME ABOUT IT!!!!!It needs to be a real bug, not just a myspellled word or something.If you find one and tell me, however, I will let you pick your ownbardic title!  Cool or what!!!							-- Saber**An interesting little qoutish thing I wrote:		-=Normality=-Normality is but a term created by society forthose whom conform to it's rules and restrictions;I follow no one's rules but my own.And if I am abnormal due to my unconforming to society,I embrace it with open arms.			Chris Hill (Psykosis).Routed from talks with a friend of mine of what is normal. :)**While Larn is the god of life and protection, Crysea is the patrongoddess of the Bardic guild.  Therefore, it is she who protectsour pets, as it is she who shields the guild hall.**  Just wanted to leave a note to 'yall to say hi.I've been working on 2.0, and it is moving along verynicely.  Look for it in the next month or so.  And remember, be nice to each other.  We used to be thatkind of guild, and I hope that we still are.,  Take care...     ;p**      First of all, I'd like to welcome you to the bards.  Secondof all, I'd like to give you a few important survival tips.    1.  Don't party with Shardaks, Cyberninjas or any othernewbie killers.  Granted, not all members of those guilds arenewbie killers, but it's better safe than sorry.  Also, don'tgo into the wastelands.  I'm told some parts of Pain's castle arealso pk, but I haven't seen this in practice.    2.  Pets can only be summoned from the bard teleport chamber.This is the number one question I hear from newly inducted bards.    3.  Wear as much armor as possible.  You can fully outfityourself at the marketplace in Ryllian.  The bastard sword isa tolerable weapon if you can't buy a bardsword.    These are just general commonsense ideas.  Ask questions.Party with people.  The more you learn, the better fighter you'llbe.  btw- I'll try to update this in the future with some moreinfo.Later,Feldegast T. Bard**Hi guys!!!  I thought it was a good time to try to get in touch with y'all, but I guess y'all don't stay up as late.  I'll give you my e-mail address... Henry57@matrix.newpaltz.eduWrite me!!!  I love it!!!Gotta go!!!  Bye!!!Fraggle :)**Hiya Bards :)  Just wanted to say hello and thank you for allowing me to join yer little familyIn times past I was a killer, but my heart had grown heavy with sorrow at each stroke of my Naginata....I hope that you will all forgive me for my crimes, even tho I will not forgive myself.heh...enuf of that  :)  I'm a Bard now, it's time to have fun  :)Cormac**Hello there Bards,Some of you might have seen me about here, but as others might note,this is my first post. The reason I'm here, is because I'm getting a bit worried about our alliance, or our future alliance with the DMages? Nobody except Saber and Mythos know about this I guess for sure, but it would be nice to know. If the Bards lore isn't going to be rewritten in alliance with our friends the Dark Mages, I would ask if we could add people to our existing alliance. This could be done by level 10 players and higher(Bard level that is)The existing alliance is dissapating slowly, and there are players in otherguilds who have shown the loyalty that our old allies the Paladins hadshown to us. These are the people I would like to ally with.Thanks for reading the babbling of a tormented soul,- Blazzer.**I've been recieving a lot of questions about theBardlist of late.  So I thought I would answer itin a medium that everyone can see.  I have changed internet providers and at presenthave not gotten permission to set up another addressas of yet.  I am working on this and as soon as Ican I will set it up.  The other possiblity I amalmost to the point of just setting up my own sightoff of ISDN to run it myself.I will post it here when it is complete.Yours in LoreBambua**One thing to say:w00 w00 w00 w00!!!!!Well guess that was more than one thing. =)Bambua**Must be the Holidays, everyone's popping in...and so here I am tooMy fellow bards, old and new, my kin...Long have a journeyed, far into other realms, even to places where magic does not exist...I have learned much, and in my wisdom would share...As I traveled, I met Saber, who moved with Harper himself...and they reminded me of home...and so I have returned...           See ya more often, I hope...                    Love and Music...                                 Alexi**This may not be my place but I'll say it anyways.I'm not sure if you are aware but the Darkmages areBOUND not to attack us, this means they cannot fightback.  So please do NOT chase after them with lightwe've had this problem before.  A darkmage will never kill you so don't do the same to them.Just my 2 cents.Bambua**1. I'm sorry I haven't been on lately.I've been sick and I got 19 hours this semsterI'll try to be on to recruit those newbies.As for the Dmage thing......I got care what is said about them or us.We don't pk and sending light to a Dmage is pking.I will not support or tolerate such behavior.As for people whining for help and such.......[AWe can take good care of ourselves and the guild is well balanced.We are not weaker than any other guild on here.Since we can't pk, we got a few benifits from it.Like double regeneration and the like.People have gone from lvl 1 to 19 or more in a week in the guild.So take care of yourself.Storm the Bardic GC**I agree completely storm, from beginning to end.And the reason that I brought it up Blazzer isbecuase it IS a player matter ;).  And yes they cankill a bard, but blieve me the consequences being what they arethey do NOT want to do it.  so please yesdon't be a baby Bards can take care fo themselvesbut also there is no need for a Bard to pk.Not just because it is agaisnt our guild, butbecause it's not something that we do.Ok I think that about does my soapbox standingfor a week ro soTake care family.Bambua**  True name works again - streight damage for now, but it works  So does agony, elemental and bind - thoughbind is still weak - i'll check that out and seewhat i can do.  -- Saber**Any bard who is interested in who the Bardic Knight really is, check out his webpage at.....	http://home.hiwaay.net/~prentisIt is not much, but I am working on it *grin***Well the name is new but the Jester is still the same. Some of you oldies but goodies may remember spawn... Well im back in a nPrepare yourself for a look at the lighter side of being a Bard.Juggling, pranks, and serenading galore. The old guard is back and hes a wise a@# crazy mother jester.  BTW In spuite of all this craziness i still plan toi help out any bard in needEver JOkingThe new versoin of spawnAkira**note I'm back....hello everyone...i would just like to say that I'm back, I didn't die or have any horible accident happen to meI would also like to tell you that all those nasty roomers about me and Rosie Odonle are NOT NOT NOT true...I hope you all read this and make sure to say Hi when you see me..**Bards,    For all the bards that still remained through our timeof trial while the bardic one was away, I give thanks foryour patience and family spirit.  I would like to say a fewthings that I've tried to promote myself while I have beenlucky enough to be in this guild.    First I'd like to say what I believe this guild is aboutas Saber invisioned it.  This being only my own interpretationmay not reflect his own.  But, as I was chosen by him longago to be a guild commander, I should think they aren't faroff.  My number one reason for joining this guild was forknowledge; to gain the knowledge with the skills I've been given and to spread that knowledge unconditionally.  The bardsare the loremasters, the ones gone to for information and soundadvice.      Now that should be the only reason.  My philosophy is to follow very simple, very broad, guides.  Everything that comesafter is in effect of that one rule.      As to the means of gaining this new knowledge, there area few guidelines which must be kept to best achieve it.  I willtry to convince all of you of them. *smile*    It is generally known that all bards are good and must stayso.  For myself, it would be better placed in the neutral cate-gory with strong good tendencies.  We must remain good so thatthe public will look to us as friends and be more ready to givetheir own knowledge to us, that we may pass it on.  I will bethe first to admit that I've shied away from the standard of good in order to gather knowledge, but only with much thoughtand foresight.  In my time as a player I was widely regarded asa friendly figure throughout the mud.  This became very usefulin taking a jaunt through the wastelands without any worry ofattack.  I was very powerful, not only in ability, in skill, butwith the knowledge I was able to gain from so much freedom. What I am saying of good is not righteous good, but the good oflife and knowledge.    We must be strong as individuals and as a guild.  Don'tforget the lessons of Crystal the Gypsy.  If someone is though of as being a weak character, they will looked down upon, ratherthan the reverence that should be shown.  Begging for equipmentor money left and right is not showing that we are strong.  Idon't mean strong as in killing the biggest monster on the game.That is might, not strenght.  The mighty fall the hardest, whereas strength will bring you back from the fall.  Be strongin self-reliance, use the knowledge to make yourself strong.    I realize that sometimes there is that wicked thing calledlife which intrudes upon us here.  I only ask that when this unfortunate times arise, that you keep it detatched from the guild.Please don't associate any actions you may take with our guild.Any bardic abilities used reflect what we as a guild are.Think about what a bards abilities are.  Singing on gossip shoutsthat you are a bard, something I'm more than proud to shout inmost situations.  Our dear pets are bardic abilites.  Don't use themto harm anyone unless in self defence.  There is always selfdefence.  There is a difference between defending yourself, andusing defence as an excuse for aggression.  Be patient: one ofmy favorite bard trials.     There is also the second most important rule to beinga bard....  Have FUN! And may the force be with you.                                     Llew**Hi ,     I wholehearedly agree with you Llew, it is not in our nature to ack likeidiots. My definition of an idiot -:One who whines about lack of coins over public channels/guild channel  The tell is a useful command, if you're stuck bad for coins, try askingsomeone, the worst that'll happen is they'll say now.One who is afraid to fight on their own, Parties are fun, but relax a bit,    does it have to be a high level char who you party with? two level 15's cankick ass, and it works out good. You have good abilities, use them andlearn how to use them well!One who sends Dark Mages light just for fun, or because they don't like theperson! This is sad, I detach myself from you. This is a pk action, whichis not in our vocabulary and a misuse of our abilities.We are a guild of brothers and lil' sisters, help each other. Listen to       each other and learn from each other. You have the ability to harm others,but it is your bardic duty to control your abilities. You have a mind ofyour own, don't screw it up with hatered, that's for Shardaks.Saber has done his best for us, and is working on bettering us, I do not  see why he should put so much effort into this, if there are those amongstus, who just belittle his idea of the bards, and shame the rest of us.I hope you see this as an expression of my thoughts, and not a personal insult.We are good.        - Blazzer the Celt.**     So....I leave for a brief time, and look what happens...you all have lessfun than when I am around...Just joking!  Of course, I have a few comments, asresident know it all Master of Lore...Firstly...     As a fairly ancient member of this guild (going on what, five years real time now?) and a friend of Saber's, I must agree with what has been said aboutwhat being a bard is..."Style Over Substance" our dear guild master used to sayall the time, and this is ever true of us...we are a noisy, flashy bunch of performance addicts, and we all know it!  Secondly...     The traditional role of a bard was to spread knowledge, teach, learn, andentertain the masses.  This is the perfect excuse for 'gossipping' if you askme, but know also that we should be known for our wisdom as well as our wrysenses of humor...we should teach by example, not by force.  If someone doesnot care to listen, that is his/her perrogative, and no one should be 'judged'simply for ignorance...although, for those people we all know are somewhat less than cordial, I find sarcasm, judiciously exposed, generally stopsmost problems...Thirdly....     I am an understanding person, and I live by what I speak, but I must saythat if I ever, EVER see or hear of any bard pk-ing, or insulting someoneuntil they attack (the "it was self-defense" argument), or sending thingslike light spells to those who are harmed by light, I shall be most vexed.I have always taken a rather extreme view of this particular bardic restrictionit is true (ask anyone, I have never even been in the Wastelands or any otherpk area, just so that I would not be forced to kill a player), and I will continue to be this way.  Bards do NOT player-kill. Period.Fourthly...     I love you, my family, my friends, and I couldn't leave forever, I missed you all too much.  So forgive me if I sound like an elder sister(or gods forbid a matriarch) at times, remember it is only because of thefeelings I have for you...Sixthly...     Akira, Spawn, whatever....did you think I would forget ?**well ive been back in the guild for about two days now and it is timei posted a note.. :)i have gone on a wonderous journey.. finding star's fathers and playing with the dreaded power that lies behind blood..the power is great and consumes some ppl but it also open awareness to thingsaround ones self.. i have returned from this journey wiser and strongerbut i have come to regain my rightfull place among the bards...it is only a shame that i beat harper back.. for he has yet to return as well.. let your hearts be free of hate and your eyes aware of theconstant wonder that surrounds you in a world of spelndar... :)               and above all SING AS LOUD AS YOU CAN!!!!!!!       LOOD<-----------there is a wocket in your pocket (white lord)**I posted the wrong address *DOH*http://www.pobox.com/~bambua/bards/Have fun all =)**it should be http://pobox.com/~bambua/bards/Sorry for the problem**well i got this little thought. which i think might be fun and not to hard to code..im kinda tired of sitting by the fountain.. and not being able to spalsh ppl like star.. :) i get all wet and she stays dryso i propose a splash cmd.. where you can spash yourself, otherplayers, andstar of course,.. maybe it would give an added description to that player likeIs drenched from a splashing by <this_player>then we could get watergun fights wher you have to fill up at the fountainjust plan good old bards stuff. :) :) :)welp                 back to trying to level                                    -wocket the ________**Isis mailed me and asked me to post this for all ->Hey everyone!As many of you know I'm moving to Seattle and as a result do not yet knowwhat kind of access I will have, nor how much time I'm going to have togive to the mud.

I admit my part incontineing this sad trend.  It is a terrible thing tosee.  I can only hope that the paths that haveled my wandering foot to other worlds of latewill once again lead me home to my family.And now excuse the ramblings of a sometimes cranky bard.  Love to you all my first family.Isis.**Hello folks, I was inducted into the bards today...I was the only one on while I was here, but I hopethat will change.  I like what I see, and I thinkthis will be fun.

Okay soenough of my babbling....The Bards Rock and we will keep it that wayas long as we have our family....Love as Always...The Kitty Bard**	We are a great guild, but even I have to admit we are in the midstof a slump...it appears that many of the old family have moved on to otherthings in their lives and either have retired or come on sparingly.  Thosethat remain often are alone or playing other characters because they don'tlike being the only one on.  Hopefully things will turn around and we can getsome cool new members..then maybe some of the old ones will play more too.It might help if some of us who can maybe try and find real newbies (Iknow they are hard to come by) and give them some help and try to impress anycool ppl we do run across.  Or try and get some rl friends addicted tomudding if you know any that aren't already ;)  We need to figure some way toget a number of cool ppl in the guild...if we can do that and getthe fun discussions and whatever going on like there used to be, when you'dnever log on without several bards being on...Recruiting used to takecare of itself back when we had the numbers because this was one of the hotguilds, but now those of us that can might want to be discreetlyaggressive so we get a few new members. Of course make sure they will fitin with our guild and all..but remember not to let people think of our guildas wimpy...even though we have lost some of our ablities we canstill kick if we know what we are doing...we don't want ppl who would otherwisemake a fine addition to our family going elsewhere simply because of thisperception.  I know that most of you who are reading this probably know all ofthis, because not too many people read this anymore except devoted bards...Now that I'm back in school, I'll try and do what I canIcepick**Hey folks, it's the almighty g.c. Alexi(good thing no one believes THAT!!! :> heehee)anyhow...I have been trying to get ahold of Saber for some time nowregarding the guild problems...if you could each go through our spells, see what's working/not, etc and mail me here, I could give him the scoop...also anything else you find out is going on would be good too...hopefully I can harrass the man into fixing things...:> see you laters...                     c'est moi**The only problem with that icepick is becauseof bugs we can't let anyone new in right nowso it wouldn't help even if we did recruitmyslfe or the other gc's can't let anyone inYou'rs in LoreBambua**I finally get to log in today to check in on my Kin, and what doI find? 24 Players, 1 of which (me) is a Bard.
