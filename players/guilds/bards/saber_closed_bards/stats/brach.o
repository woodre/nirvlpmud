description "stands tall and pround as he roams the land. He has loose dark brown hair which curls slightly at the back. His light brown eyes sweep the room, catching every detail. A small blue tattoo in the shape of a hawk is on his left cheek. The friendly smile on his lips appears to be permanent and lightens your mood when you see it. Llew's attire consists of deep black pants with silver trim running the length. His tunic is a dark river blue decorite with sky blue whorls and spirils. A golden torc surrounds his neck. One end a hawk, matching the tattoo on his cheek,the other end, a wolf. Brown leather boots with bardic runes cover his feet.Firmly held in Llew's hand is an elm staff, symbolizing generosity. By his nature, you feel he would do anything you ask of him. Llew is compassionate and honorable. The most exquisite redwood mandolin is slung across his shoulder and a wooden recorder is hung by a cord. The bowl of the mandolin is covered in dark runes that give off a very pale white light."
