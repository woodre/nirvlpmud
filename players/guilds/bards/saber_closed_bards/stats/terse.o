description "is, by appearances, a rather young woodland elf of moderate height and build.She is, in fact, much older than she looks, but her cheerful smile andbright-eyed countenance belie this..(Elves are good at that.)  She isclad in a loose-fitting leather tunic without a belt, and she wears herlong, curly blonde hair down around her shoulders, held back from herface with a customary wreath of flowers around her forehead, the elvendenotation of a lifemated woman."
