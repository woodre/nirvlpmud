Not About a Girl(sparrowhawk, May 15, 8)
I was lost, and I didn't even know it.
I was anxious, but didn't care to show it.
I was wondering down the road, where I've gone, and where I'll be
And was wondering if the plans that I had chosen were for me.
And that
Is when I saw Her

There she was, dressed in blue,
And I never thought I'd seen anything as beautiful as you.
I picked you up; I held you close;
I sought to know you well.
And I know you've in my heart a special place to dwell.
