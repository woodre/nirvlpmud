>> UPDATES!
  Right now there is'nt much visible going on. The guild core is
  currently being furrowed out to fit the new morph forms. We are
  going from 5 levels, with roughly 13 (?) forms, to 15 levels with
  at least 60, and possibly 20 more. You should not run into problems
  with the existing command set, existing morphs (except blobel), and
  any existing code in the jello. The only new stuff that will be
  buggy (in the motd) will be NEW stuff. Before I can add any new
  forms I HAVE to make sure that the kernel is stable and can fit
  the new infrastructure and features required for them bulletproof.

  I have finally found the breakthrough in legalizing the extremely
  hard hits in combat caused by higher level forms. Tetrapod was already
  pushing the limit, and going higher was a huge stumbling block
  in making heavier morph forms.
  What is the price paid? Experience. Some atomic morph form like
  dark tetrapod, hydra, or the other multilimbed/headed forms will
  suck exp out of you if you land hits with severe excessive force.
  Why do this? Well its simple. I hit the legal hp/round limit with
  tetrapod. There was no way I could keep anything higher legal or
  even interesting without some sort of drawback. If you guys hate this
  idea let me know. I need some feedback or i'll just assume its ok.
  
  Feedback? Questions? Comments?
