>> GUILD WARS

  As fun as they can be, I expect members of the guild NOT to
participate in any sort of en-masse genocide of other guilds.

  If you are found to have started a guild war, dragging us into it,
you will be _expelled_ from the guild. This sort of thing will be
dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

  If you are on jumped, and on the defensive, and can explain (more
importantly prove) what had happened, then that is a different
story. Keep your feuds on the personal level, and don't drag other
unsuspecting guild members in.
