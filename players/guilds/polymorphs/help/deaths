>> DEATH AND WHAT HAPPENS


Polymorphs do not 'die' like normal players. Here is what happens
to normal players:


  You take too many hits, and hitpoints goes negative. You die.
  You now wander the mud as a ghost, and then go back for your corpse
  once you have prayed in the church.


This is what happens to polymorphs:


  You take too many hits, and hitpoints goes negative. You die.
  Spuck bails you out and reattaches your soul to a physical form.
  You awaken in the guild room and can go back for your corpse.
