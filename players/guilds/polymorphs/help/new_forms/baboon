[BABOON] Level [6] 200 charges (+sta, -int, -mag, +str, +ste)

  The baboon is a smart, tough, somewhat fearless creature that has a
  tendency to throw its own feces at enemies. Excellent. Baboons work
  very well when other baboons are present, as additional polymorphs with
  the same form will find that their combat effectiveness will improve
  tremendously when hunting together.
  
  Baboons have an ability to strap an extra weapon, and can apply charges
  directly to their clay.
