[TREE] Level [2] 200 charges (++sta, --int, --mag, ++str, --ste, --luck)
       (loss of total mobility, cannot retaliate in combat.)

  As this polymorph, you can produce quantities of healing fruit,
  and being a hybridized plant, a whole bunch of varieties as well.
  However, you cannot do anything, except remain planted in one spot.
  This polymorph can become extremely handy in team combat.
