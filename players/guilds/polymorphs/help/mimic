[MIMIC] Level [5] 50 charges (stats unchanged, no weapons, no armor)


  By taking the form of a mimic, you can imitate the likenesses of objects
  that are in your inventory or in your immediate environment. Of course
  you will not be able to imitate other players, but pretty much anything
  else goes. Please note that you will be able to "say" but not emote or
  anything else while in this form. REPEAT - EMOTES DO NOTHING!
