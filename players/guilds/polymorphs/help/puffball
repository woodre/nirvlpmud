[PUFFBALL] Level [4] 400 charges (--sta, ++int, ++mag, --str, +ste, +luck)
           (cannot wear armors)

  The puffball is a creature that exists in a near pure-energy state.
  Able to cast a devastating array of offensive spells, and deal with
  energy-matter reactions much easier and faster than a normal polymorph,
  the puffball is most fearsome in combat. Its main drawbacks are
  a severely weakened physical form, in terms of its crippled
  constitution, and inability to carry almost anything.
