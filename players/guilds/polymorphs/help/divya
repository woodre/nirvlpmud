[DIVYA] Level [5] 760 charges (-sta, +int, ++mag, -str, -ste, ++luck)

  fighting prowess and grace. Their roles were primarily as secretive
  personal bodyguards and enforcers of the KDY Sisterhood.
  
  Also gifted with awesome cunning and versatility in hand-to-hand combat,
  the ability to channel extra-dimensional forces, the Divya is most
  feared indeed. Note that this is a FEMALE GENDER ONLY morph form.
