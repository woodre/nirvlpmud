>> Welcome To The Polymorphs!


A Quick Primer to get started:

Use the command 'vibe <msg>' to talk to other members of the guild.

Use the command 'guild who' to see who else is logged on.

The command 'guild' teleports you back to the guild hall but it has
limited range and may cost some spell points.


For guild abilities type:                'info abilities'
