[DARK TETRAPOD] Level [6] 840 charges 
                (++sta, -int, -mag, ++str, -ste, ++luck)

  A more evolved version of the average tetrapod, the dark tetrapod has
  several major advantages; increased stamina and strength, better 
  bonuses in combat, night vision, and a cloaking ability second
  only to the Necromonger that provides for cat-like cover.
  Dark tetrapods suffer from the same difficulties that ordinary tetrapods
  face, such as an unstable duration of morph time, and a general
  ignorance of magic.

  Dark tetrapods can still wield up to four weapons at a time.
