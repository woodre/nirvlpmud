>> GAME CONDITIONS

The state of an LPMud is inherently random, and things both good and bad
are bound to happen. Please read and understand this document.

MUD CRASHES

The mud is bound to crash. This will take away all of your existing
equipment. Sometimes you will be reimbursed by the game driver for 'shop'
price value on items. This is usually not worth the amount of the items.
Wizards can choose to reimburse on a case-by-case basis. Do not expect it
unless a guilty wiz comes around after crashing the mud :)

GUILD BUGS

The guild is not perfect. We are trying constantly to improve and tighten
our code. Mizan is the coder but needs feedback from the members as well
to spot potentially lethal or equipment-robbing bugs. It is with the
teamwork and coordination of the Guild that we succeed! Be mindful that
reimbursements are strictly on a case-by-case basis. Same rule applies
as above. Do not expect nor rule out the possibility of some reimbursement.
Talk to the wiz and if they say no, respect that and move on.

DESIGN RESTRICTIONS

Sometimes bad things will happen that seem like bugs. Accept that some things
are meant to be broken. Keep in mind that there are theme and design limits
across the mud. These things deliberately hinder certain actions while
enabling others. This guild in particular does not try to be an 'Uberguild'
with all powers being omniscient and omnipresent and 100% reliable.
There are places in the guild where certain things may fail. Things are
not absolute, and usually by design. Please bear that in mind.

COMMUNICATE AND LISTEN!

This is a two way street. Try and talk to me, and I will listen. I expect
that if I say something you will listen. Note that listen does not mean
'to blindly follow'. It means to absorb and integrate the knowledge being
swapped.

Thank you for reading.
