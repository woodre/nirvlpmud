>> GUILD COMMAND


	There will be no need for guild commanders/lieutenants in

this guild. GCs exist only to eromote/demote players' guild levels, or even add
experience when the need arises. In all the time i've played, I

have mostly seen GCs abuse the powers given to them. That does not mean
that all of them are corrupt, just that it fixing the damage they
cause is a waste of time, and not having them at all is more efficient,
provided the guild is coded as 'bulletproof' possible.
	As far as giving potential leaders in this guild figurehead
GC status, at least, something may pop up in the future. Ideas on how to
go about it are appreciated.
