>> TUG IN THE GUILD ROOM

  While in the guild room, you will be able to safely store certain
items between reboots. The commands for this are:

push <item>  Pushes things into the ether-muck to be stored. Anything
             which has not been pushed will disappear between reboots.
             Push does NOT cost any SPS. The item must be in the room.

tug <pos>    Recover things that may have been pushed into the ether-muck.
             NOTE THAT TUG COSTS SPS: 2 * your player level. This means a
             level 19 player will cost 38 SPS to tug per item.
             To see what items are in what positions, use 'tug list'.


   It is important to remember that things put into the ether-muck are
communal property of all members in the guild. If you take something
from tug, it is expected that you replace it with something of similar
function and value. It is highly frowned upon to take things from tug
and sell them at the shop. Constant mooching of this sort is enough to
draw a punishment of some sort.

   Remember that newer players are not expected to put anything in tug.
They are expected however to return things that they may find there.
Below are additional commands relevant to push-tug:


tug activity       Displays a log of recent push-tug transactions.

tug tracking       Displays a log of recent whereabouts of things that
                   have been withdrawn with 'tug'.

tug finger <plyr>  For example 'tug finger mizan' to see the history of
                   a player's activity with tug and push. The player does
                   not have to be logged in.

tug list           Displays a listing of what is currently pushed into
                   the ether-muck. The numbers of the positions are what
                   you would use to 'tug' items with.
