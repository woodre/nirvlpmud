[SPONGE] Level [3] 250 charges (++sta, --int, --mag, +str, -ste, +luck)

         (no weapons, no retaliation in combat)


  A sponge is an interesting individual. Unable to wield weapons or cast
  any offensive spells, or even fight back, it is useful only in team
  combat. Sponges can mean the difference between life and death for
  a teammate, since they are gifted with a tremendous hit-point bonus.
  Adventurers who party with the sponge will come to respect and revere
  its abilities to absorb a tremendous amount of damage.
