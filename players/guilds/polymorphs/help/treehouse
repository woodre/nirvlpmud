[TREEHOUSE] Level [3] 200 charges (no stat changes)

       (loss of total mobility, cannot fight in combat)


  Taking the form of a treehouse makes you an instant party. Fellow
  guild members and allies can take comfort within your facilities and
  both rest and entertain themselves. Note that you will be able to hear
  events from both inside and outside the treehouse. It gets a little
  bit weird to cope with that kind of text bandwidth but once mastered
  is quite fun indeed.
