[HELPME] (level =< 3) (7 experience)

  A strange command, uses the guild channel to tell everyone where
  you are, what you are fighting, and how many enemies are present.
  It costs 7 EXPERIENCE points, not spell points for each use, and
  after guild level 3 you cannot use it any more (Sour the milk).

Usage:  helpme
