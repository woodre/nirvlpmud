msgin "awakens.  Her mass seperates itself from the other ether, it soon shifts from colorless ooze to red, green and tan.  Quickly it assumes a humanoid form, details developing each moment.  The red shifts to long flowing hair, the green to her eyes, and the tan forms her body.  Jedra steps from the wall, ready again to explore the chaos about her."
msgout "grows weary, her form flows, the details running.  Jedra finds she can no longer support the effort of this shape, she collapses into the ether she was made of, the various colors fading into a mute grey."
