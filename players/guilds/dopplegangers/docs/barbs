The barbarians guild is disigned mostly around fighting rather than pure
spells.  They have strength in forging their own weapons and armor as one of
their many benefits and can do some rather devastating damage to any opponent.
They can also use their faction mark to store hit points for later use.
Also, their wolves can be very useful in helping you in battles and for
helping you scout areas.

For a list of the barbarian's help menu type "info bh".
