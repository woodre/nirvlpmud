    ************************** Guild News! *******************************

There is a little problem with movement.  It seems that at odd times it
won't let you move in any direction.  For some reason this is linked with
the morphing command.  The temporary solution (until I can fix it) is 
for you to type "change" 2 times back to back.  (strange bug if ya ask me)

** COMMAND CHANGE **  "WIMPY %"   is now   "WHIMPY %"   (so that you can turn 
off the other wimpy).

The problem of the "sw", "nw", "ne", and "se" short commands has been fixed.
(You can remove their longname counter parts from your quicktyper if you
put it in there ;)

One final note:  I would really like your suggestions.  I am running out of
ideas and anything you can tell me that you would like to see would really
help.  Remember, this is YOUR guild!  Let's try to make it THE best guild
online.

Hello!

I'll be doing some work on the guild, and changing some things around so
that they work more like I believe they were intended to work.  Specifically
Morphing, Pets, and 'Guard'.  Use the 'note' command to drop me a note, or
you can mail me from the Post Office!
