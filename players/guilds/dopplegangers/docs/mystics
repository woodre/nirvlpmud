The mystics guild is design around spells and magic more than pure physical
attack spells and such.  They have spells that can litterally cripple any foe
for a time, they can also enchant armor, dull weapons, and much more!
They can also use their faction mark to store spell points for later use.
Also, their imps can be very useful in helping you in battles and for
helping you scout areas.
