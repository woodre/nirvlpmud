new_head "Factions"
new_text "Hello!This board was already here, but I thought I'd take the opportunity to addsome comments on the guild factions.These factions and ideas were implemented long ago, and have since beenremoved.  I have re-added them, but the original ideas were never broughtto full fruition.You can join a single faction upon maxing the Doppleganger guild.  I knowit says that you can join another once you max that one, but you can't.You probably won't be able to ever, as it would just be too powerful.The factions are powerful enough as they are.  Currently there are twofactions, the Barbarians, and the Mystics, which I have recoded to tryand eliminate any bugs that have come up.If you have any questions, feel free to post here, or better yet, justdrop me a mud mail.Happy Factions  Rumplemintz"
