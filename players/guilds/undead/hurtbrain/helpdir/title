Spell Name: title
Guild Lvl : 2nd
Spell Cost: 10 Spell Points

Descript. : Let's you set you post-title however you want, until the string
	    you insert is not longer than 70 characters. 
	    Of course I trust that you won't set VULGAR titles, because that
	    would have effects on all the guilders, this command would be
            deleted.
