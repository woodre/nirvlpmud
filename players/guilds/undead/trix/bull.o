I hope this is just a bug, but it costs me many sps to try to tomb while hidden, realize i cant, then have to do it againLove,Chrys**Tue Feb 18 10:19:19 1997 | [Myna]: our situation:**Ok guys,this is our situation. A fuckin wiz modified our code and created Conan andwent around doing stupid and crazy things. Boltar closed us, but Pain toldhim he can revise the code. Now whe have all the spells up to glevel 4 active,but now feign costs 60 sps. I think that other changes will happen but Idon't know when and what they will be.That's all.                                           Myna**Wed Feb 19 09:45:07 1997 | [Ahira]: HIDE revisited:**Hiyas.  Just a quick note here.  In case you didn't already know, HIDE helps you regain some spell points and hit points when you arehidden (you get em back faster).  Also, if you are hidden, in a party and following somebody it tends to wreak havoc on the person being followed.  Then, when you look into an area you see :<your name here> the <your title here> (neutral)The morph of an undead.All in the same room.  I don't know if this is a bug (I hope not).  Also, if you hadn't noticed non-guild pets act funny while you are hidden : they enter and exit the room looking for the object.That's all for nowEternally yours, Ahira the Servant of the Bones**Tue Feb 25 00:38:06 1997 | [Francesco]: back:**hi do, fellow undeadsi have been away from the mud for several months, i will then ask some of my firneds all that happened in this priod. were we closed? whatabout the note of myna? i will start teaching spring semester in one week, but i am confident i will be ble to playnow and then, more than what i recently did. (diddnt  ** chuckle **)my way of play is always the same which means i am here to help my friends and expecially my guildmateshope meeting you all soonyour undead foreverf**Sun Mar  2 19:46:28 1997 | [Icebreaker]: guild powers:**Hi deads,that is, however many of us are left,I'm just wondering, now that we're back, has anybodyactivly begun coding for us, besides Pain helpingus out by bringing our abilities back.What I mean is, there are a few abilities that weren't finished before we ran into ourproblem., are they gonna be finished, orare we still waiting for someone to help us out inthat aspect.I'm not griping, just wanna know what's    happening.Sorry about any possible typos, I forgot tomuffle my channels.Laterz!Icebreakerps: if ya wanna clear up this message, mail me an' i'll clerr clarify it on here again.**Thu Mar 13 07:47:40 1997 | [Myna]: Re: New Guildmember needs Help:**When you are hidden your stealth is great so you can skip even the mostaggressive monster. And when you are fighting and you leave the room,if you come back hidden you will not be attacked.                                   Myna**Tue Mar 18 17:56:08 1997 | [Mathais]: GUILD WIZ!?:**I have spoken to Reflex,Some of you may know him, he has been a GC for the undead before and hesays he has time to work on the guild, at least to maintain and legalize it.If anyone else fancies getting our powers back and maybe improving them in thefuture let me know, and boltar too!Thanks, Math**Tue Mar 18 18:20:32 1997 | [Jb]: Guild wiz?!:**   Hello one of your GC's here with an important note.As you have seen, Mathias has talk with reflex about becoming guild wiz.I have talk it over with reflex and he is willing to take on the job.He said it would tke time but would revamp the guild and get the guild out of the stagnation it has been in.He does plan on changing some things and doesn't give any guarrentees,however I beleive that it would be better for the guild in the long run.I don't know the status on the other guild wizs but they haven't done anything for the guild in quite some time.So having reflex as a guild wiz would help solve our current problemswith stagnation and lack of powers.  Please post your thoughts on this board.Thank you for your time.  Long live the UNDEAD.  :)jb**Wed Mar 19 22:06:16 1997 | [Icebreaker]: Agree:**'lo all,I agree with Jb and Mathias about letting Reflex become our guild wiz. We have survived for a long time, for about3 years if I remember. Maintaining the guildand improving our powers would be a coolidea. I think Reflex would be an awsome guildwiz.LaterzIcebreaker**Thu Mar 20 08:05:00 1997 | [Myna]: My opinion:**Hello mates,I support Reflex as a coding wiz of our guild. I hate to see the situationin which we are and I think that Ref is the right person to rise it up.The oldest of us *poke JB* know that I am right.I will ask Reflex too and let you know what his answer will be.Your Undead forever                                          Myna**Sun Mar 30 02:31:43 1997 | [Mathais]: Guildwiz DENIED!:**Heyas,Been outa commission a bit but Im back in the saddle again...Reflex will not be considered for guild wiz until he completes an area,that is pains conditions, until then we have to settle for being asbadass as we currently are.  Look for supreme badassness soon to come.UNDEAD RULE!-Mathais**Wed Apr 16 15:38:21 1997 | [Fozzy]: Uh:**I left the CyberNinjas for a new guild, this is what I have chosen. heh none of our guild powers work *bog* I dunno why that is. But I hope they do this guild used to be cool, with people in it (matt was an undead) and it rocked, fog charm and all that, I had zombies and death dogs. it rocked, but now look at it, its in shambles We need a guild Wizard and I really want reflex to make his area and take this guild over I am confident that he will do a good job in helping us out. Although it will probally be a long time I think the wait is worth it to get the Undeads back, with their old and hopefully some new powers. Thank you.Fozzy The Pyschotic Fluffy Bear**Wed Apr 16 19:38:28 1997 | [Sith]: POWERS {fozzy}:**Hey foz...The powers work in this guild up to level 7 (but not all at 7)There is a bug that not all seem to experience but I and some othershave had to put up with.When you join, you need to renew before using your powers, each timeyou advance you also need to renew in order to use your powers. Some things that the help file say works don't, two that I know of aressp and shp (store hps and sps).Other than that I believe everything works.I don't know how powerful this guild is in pk yet but it is very defensivein pk areas.When hidden players dont see you and/or can't attack you.I have fended off several level 19+ players at once long enough to leave theroom and hide. Then you're untouchable.                                    $ith**Thu Apr 17 07:48:14 1997 | [Myna]: Re: POWERS:**Hello to all my mates.Our situation is the following.All the commands up to level 7 now works. ssp and shp are the bugged spellsbecause of which we were revised. I don't think they will be up soon. I reallyappriceate any note on everything that doesn't work properly, so I can mailPain to ask him to fix the problem. Thank you in advance.Also, after the revision the cost of many spells are changed respect to thatreported on the help files. I didn't make a cmpleat check, but I hope towrite a note about it soon. Again, this is not a pk guild so we haven't allthe 'tools' Cybers and Shards have. But hide is really powerful and when (andif) ssp and shp will be back we will be more powerful in every kind of fight,not only in pk.But I want to thank you all that come back. This guild really need animprovement and the more we are, the more our problem will be considered. ASto me, I like to see old players around, especially those who tested otherguilds. They are the proof that, even with all our problem, we still are oneof the best guild of the mud.Your Undead forever                                             Myna**Tue Apr 22 17:33:21 1997 | [Armadillo]: I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!!!!!:**Hi all you Undead freaks and freakettes!  Just wanted to post a note and let all know that I am back for a good while.  Been gone for almost a year nowand trying to get caught up on all the changes.I've been reading all the notes on the bulletin boardand assessing the situation.  Things look kinda low right now, I know.But you've gotta keep one thing in mind. This guild has been thru this beforeIt was totally shut down and had no members left, except for a handful of stubborn folk like myself.  But the main thing to keep in mind hereis that the Undead is more than a guild.  It is a family.  As long as we sticktogether as a family, we'll be fine.  The worst part about the last time we were closed, was that everyone was bickering amongst themselves and nothing could get done.  Stick together my brethren, and show the world that NOTHINGwill pull us apart, and the powers that be will take notice.Until I see you,UNDEAD FOREVERArmadillo**Thu May  8 10:35:22 1997 | [Mordread]: traiter:** hey all ,okay get this darkside came ot our guild and accepted my hospitality.the he quit ..

Here there are my results.LEVEL 1tomb = 50 (0 from church)Among the other spells I only tested utp and uep: they work and are freeso I suppose nothing else has been changed at this levelLEVEL 2title = 0I couldn't check qgm since it's free for GCs and speed since I already haveone. It was obviously impossible to check burn but I don't think this is abig deal :)LEVEL 3send = 50charm = 35Someone reported me that send doesn't work: well, it works fine :)LEVEL 4feign = 60aid has still the usual limitations.LEVEL 5shadows = 60Glare = 50LEVEL 6lightning = 80The spells tha allowed us to store and get sps/hps are no longer activeLEVEL 7Possess doesn't seem to work. I didn't tested revive.That's all. Please if you find some mistakes in the previuos valuespost a note here with the corrections: we will appreciate :)Have A LOT of fun around.Your Undead forever                                              MynaP.S.: about level 1 spells, I tested also hide: it's still free.**Thu Jul  3 11:25:29 1997 | [Myna]: BUG!!!!:**DeadHeads,as many of you already know, there is a bug that prevents people from joining the guild. The life is transfered in thei inventorybut none of the commands work.Till the bug will be fixed please don't let anyone join or,if they join, ask a wiz to get rid of their life clearlystating the situation: some of them knows the existence of the bug,some don't.I told Pain about the bug and he will do something as soon as he can. Iwill post another note when the bug will be fixed.Thanks                                            Myna**Tue Jul 22 03:34:42 1997 | [Myna]: Reflex:**Ok DeadHeads,this is the time. Make a poll among the active players to count ourself andsee how many of us want Reflex to work on the bug of the new lifes. If itis the (hopefully large) majority, then each player should mail Pain aboutthis subject. I did mail Pain, but I need the support of all who agreeswith me.Hugs to you all                                             Myna**"
