*****************************
Necromancer Guild
*****************************

As far as I can tell, this guild was originally coded by Sebastian.
The code then fell into the hands of Daranath, who updated and changed
the entire code.  After Darnath, Wocket recoded the guild and changed
it yet again.

Then I ported the guild over to be compatible with LDMud driver. I recoded
most of it to use strict_types, and took out unecessary code in some of
the files.

I took out all of the code in the 'defs.h' file and converted that over to be just
defines.

After all was working on LDMud driver, I then tested and made some changes
to make the code compatible with the old LPMud as well.  It was then moved from
Wocket's dir into /players/guilds/necro and updated accordingly.

Some code remains from Wocket's, (example, the room inherits) and should
remain until /room/room has been recoded to incorporate that.  All mention
or path's to wizards actual dir's should be recoded/removed.

Update - Sept 3, 2010 per mail from Wocket
Hey, I just read your readme on the history of the necros and there was
some mistakes that I wanted to correct.  The guild was originally created
to Daranath who got the code to beta before he left the mud.  Mythos then
gave the guild to  me and I was originally intent on just doing some quick
fixes to get it to a release state, but being me I had some artist things I
wanted to fix and one thing lead to another and basically did a complete
rewrite of the code and design of the guild.  The character sebastian was
going to be an ingame character that I played who was going to act as the
'scribe' of the guild and impart the lore of it to the other players.
Unfortunately inactivity made that not as good as a goal as it originally
sounded.  That character was eventually wiped and I since  recreated it,
but have never brought it back to the state it was before.  I thought I
would just share some of those tid bits about the history of the guild.  I
also wanted to thank you for keeping it up to date.  It is always a shame
when things wither just because of lack of simple maintance.  Keep up the
good work.   -wocket
