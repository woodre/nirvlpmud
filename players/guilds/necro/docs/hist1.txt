    [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]
         
     A brief history of the Necromancers guild here on Nirvana:

     A great many years ago, a man named Sagan was born through the
     union of a human female and a demonic prince from the Realm
     of Death. Sagan showed great magical promise and his mother
     went as far as to send him to a school specifically to hone
     and develop his magical abilities. A dozen years later, Sagan
     graduated from the magic academy with high honors. He then 
     travelled back to live with his mother. A number of years
     went by when a magical experiment accidentally killed his 
     mother. Sagan's hunger for the dark arts begins.
         
     Sagan left his mother's home and travelled to Nirvana, 
     joining the healers guild and becoming one of their more
     promising members. He believed that eventually he would be
     able to resurrect his slain mother through his learnings with
     the Hall. Frustration grew within Sagan, as this was not the
     case. Bringing the dead back to life after the spirit (or
     ghost) has left Nirvana is beyond theer power.
