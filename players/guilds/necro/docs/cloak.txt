    [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]
         
         Cloak of Confusion Spell (offensive)

     Raising a fog from the unearthly realms, the necromancer
     can disorient and confuse his apponent.  Upon the fog surrounding
     the necromancer's target, his opponent's attack sequences will
     be disrupted.  This should allow the necromancer, an easier
     battle, causing more and receiving less damage in the process.
  
     Note -> This will start a fight with the target
