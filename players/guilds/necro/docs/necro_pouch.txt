    [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]
         
         Necromancer Component Pouch

     The Necromancers carry a component pouch with then at all
     times. This pouch is with them when they log into the game
     and helps to keep track of exactly how many of each type of
     component the particular Necromancer has (see parts). Without
     the component pouch, a Necromancer cannot contact the Realm 
     of Death in order to cast any spells. A component, after being
     cut from a corpse, needs to be stored within the pouch for
     use.
