    [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]
         
           Wither (offensive)

     Once a necromancer has mastered all aspects in dealing with
     with the realm of death, and communed with the spirits on a
     regular basis, he gains the special knowlege and ability to 
     utilize the power of a captured soul from a former adversary.  
                    
     A soul is the very essence of life itself, the culmination
     of all one becomes or ever will be.  To use such a component
     in the casting of a spell is a powerful and potent endeavour.
 
     Using the soul of another, combined with beating hearts, you 
     can drain the energy of the living.  They will begin to wither
     in front of the caster as the captured soul is then released to 
     the Realm of Death.
