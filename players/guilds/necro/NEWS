  Welcome back to the death realms fellow Necromancers!
The necromancer guild has undergone some changes.  Most
of these changes are in the realm of death, and will
hardly be noticed by most.  Please be sure to utilize
your 'nbug' command to report any problems.  The powers
of the necromancers are all receiving udpates that should
not be noticed, and powers that have not been accesbile
in the past may be updated and included into the knowledge
that many necromancers of the past have been waiting for.
