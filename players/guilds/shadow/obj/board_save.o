Think about itHowdy**As trail is one of the first few skills available, Iattempted to set up a simple trail from the entrance of the shadow guild to the village greenhowever, whenever I would type 'track forward' itwould bring up this message:Usage: 'trail' to drop trail, 'trail <back or forward> <number> to move back or forwardon the trail.  If no number the trail will be followed as far as possible. followed as far as possible.**Alright, here's a wierd one.  Sometimes when I typedrain on a mob, it will give me the message,"you are now hunting 'mob'  I have triedseveral different things to try to determinewhat is making it do this, but it isn't consistent**Alright, I've tested enough by now to know that this is quitea different guild from anything we have on now.  However, I thinka few things could be added to make it a 'cool' guild.For starters, having some color to the 'shp' monitor would bea plus.  Or, as an alternative, being able to put the shp intoyour standard monitor would cover the same ground.Also, I think a whole slew of guild emotes would be cool. And notjust added on ones, I'm talking about superceding emotes for thingslike 'bow' and 'nog' and 'smile' and 'grin' and 'dance' and 'chuckle'and that sort of thing.  I believe that this will add an element ofdistinctiveness to us from the outside that would be good.Furthermore, when I joined for beta, I had (<SHADOW>) for my alignment.Now, I have no idea if this pops up with the 'shadow' command (which I'mnot big enough to use yet) but if it doesn't, I think it would be coolto have that as a constant alignment,On a strange note, I think it might be interesting to have guild pretitles,and leave the titles to be the standard mud ones.  I think that might add aninteresting touch to us, yet again.     Probably more thoughts than can be taken care of quickly. . .                 Iso**Alright, while I appreciate having a guild monitor with the shp in them,it isn't a functional monitor.  For one, there is no 'intox' field in it,which leads to some guessing.  I have a custom monitor which still pops upwhen I fight, but I can't view it, becuase the guild monitor has the samecommand as the mud standard monitor.  Now my primary suggestioin (as I mentionedeariler) would be to allow us to add the shadow points to the standard mudmonitor.  As an alternative, you should change the id tag for the guild monitorto something like sh_mon, just so we could make a distinction between mud and guildmonitors.     Iso**Just got the servant, and two things stuck out at me.  One, was thatthe servants hps were put into the guild monitor, see my above thoughtson the guild monitor, and apply them to this situation.  Also, the samebug that was reported eariler, hold true for me.  I have my servant rightnext to me as I type, but 'sc' says I don't.   Iso**Heh, yet again I have things going wrong.  As a side note, Iam testing a pregenancy while I'm betaing, just to see if thatmakes any differences.Anyway, I had just loaded up with my gear, and headed into the kale'sin order to make some extra coins.  the first room I appeared in containeda white kale, but I knew I couldn't last a whole battle with it, so Imoved around in search of a yellow kale.  Upon finding a yellow kale, Ifirst initiated combat with 'kill kale' and proceeded to try to type'drain'.  However, nothing happened.  No error message, not anything, itmerely accpeted the command, yet did nothing with it.  I left that room insearch of a different kale.  I found a different yellow kale, and typed 'drain kale' but it gave me the message 'you drain the energy from WHITE kale'.I then attempted once again to start combat with 'kill kale' and succeeded, butthe same problem with the drain command happened as with the first yellow kale.I believe that the guild spell was targetting the first kale I ran into in the area.I'm not sure exactly how to address this problem.As soon as I had those two failed attempts at killing the kale's, I typed 'update_me'which updated me, and cuased my ability to see in the dark to go away.  Iunderstand this has happened before, and wanted to let you know that it is stillhappening.Iso**Um. . .I logged in today, and my pearl had disappeared.  Before I hadleft last, I had changed it from the servant, into a pearl.  Not surewhy it disappeared.  btw, I am testing a pregnancy while I beta   Iso88**Okay, now that I've had some time to fight with my servant,I have a suggestion about how it displays.  I jokingly nameit after something common from the mud, like a monster, or an itemjust to get some wierd looks.  However, when I fight, the messagestill calls it 'servant'.  It would be cool if the combat displaywas the name that you called it, sort of like Eurales demon, orthe Wocket pets.  Iso**Okay, there is definitly a bug with monsters of the same name, andit spans areas.  I was fighting the absyntian centaur in the keep,and was doing my standard 'drain' not 'drain centaur' and hadcast it successfully several times, when it suddenly changedtargets mid battle to a colored Plains Centaur, which exists inMaledicta's old area, the new continent.  I left, and came back a fewseconds later and when combat started back up, I used 'drain centaur'but the target was still all wrong.  This is a buggy spell, and needsto be watched.    Iso**I've determined that the pearl stays with you over a quit, and adisconnect, but not over a reboot as your help file says.  Eitheryou should fix it so that it stays over a reboot as you said, or sayon the help files that it doesn't.   Iso**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
