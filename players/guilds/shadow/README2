New guild functions:

 /players/guilds/shadow/testshadow.c:
      scan <monster> (scan_monster()) - 
         scans a monster to get current % of hps
         level 4, cost 20

 /players/guilds/shadow/obj/pearl.c
   pearl.c is the control object for the servant functions.  It defines
   commands called to (same path)/servant.c.  These commands currently
   include:

   change -   Causes the pearl to "change" into a servant/vice versa
              Actually just clones a servant object and assignes it the
              remembered hit_points and short_desc, or destructs the
              servant object.  The pearl has no short() when a servant exists.
   attack <monster> - Causes a servant to attack a present monster.
   guard <monster> - Any monster not being attacked/attacking anything can be
              guarded.  The servant stops following the master and waits in
              the room.  Any non - shadow that attacks the guarded monster
              gets attacked by the servant.   The player gets warned that the
              servant is under attack.
              Cost - 30 sp
   wait -     The servant will wait behind in a room until called.
   come -     Brings the servant out of wait/guard mode.
              cost - 20 sp (if not in same room, else 0)

   slook -    See through the servants eyes what is in its room.
              cost - 10 sp

   All servant spells are 6th level.  The only dubious one is guard.  I could
set the servant up to have a wc of 9 or 10 when guarding, so that a newbie
wouldn't get wasted for attacking a monster.   
   The pearl auto loads, remembering the servant's name, hp, and the masters
name.

The pearl/servant would cost 125 sp to get new, and free to autoload

I've updated this file 11:16 Wednesday night....please tell me if you read the
