POINTS

For using guild spells, you have spell points and shadow points.  The shadow
points are like a spell point storing system.  Your max shadow points are 
seven times your guild level.  By default, shadow points are drained first,
then spell points.  You can transfer spell and shadow points ( see 'info 
transfer' ) or heal yourself ( see 'info cure').  You can also set spell points
to be drained first ( see 'info toggle').
