TRANSFER

usage: 'transfer <number of points> <sp spell points) or shp (shadow points)>

This allows you to transer one kind of points ( shadow or spells ) to the
other.   The number must be a positive integer.  Not all the points get
transfered;  the higher your guild level the more get transfered.
The transfered ratio is (shadow level) / (shadow level + 2) or
3/4 which ever is larger. 

You may not use transfer to exceed your maximum spell or shadow
points. Maximum shadow points are equal to seven tumes your shadow
level.
