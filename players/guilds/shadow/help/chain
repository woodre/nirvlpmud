CHAIN

Usage: 'chain'

'Chain' is an area attack spell.  It attacks anything in the room except a
player, an inanimate object, and a shadow servant.  The damage is 5 times 
your level, and the cost depends on how many creatures are in the room (the
more people to attack the cheaper it is).  You will cast a fireball at the 
first monster in the room, then the next, until you run out of points or out
of monsters.

Note:  All the monsters that you attack with this spell will then attack you.
