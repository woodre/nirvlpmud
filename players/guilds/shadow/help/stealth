STEALTH

usage: stealth <movement command>

This command allows you to move without making any sound.  As of now, because
certain rooms are programmed certain ways, most places in town and some
castle rooms will not work, but most places in castles should.  The command
must be listed in the 'obvious exits' part of the room description.

Your stealth stat and your shadow level influence the chance that someone 
in the room you are leaving or entering will see you.
