FORGE

usage: 'forge <item>'

Forge allows you to create weapons/armor.  The strength of the weapon/armor
depends on your level, and the spell cost will vary by weapon.

At present, the items you can make are: dagger, sword, blade, and chainmail.
Generally, these items will be a little heavy, but they are a good place to
start when you need something to start with.
