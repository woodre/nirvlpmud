usage: summon <player>

Summon will allow you to summon another player ( who must be a shadow ) to 
your location.  You and the player must be allowing summons ( see also
'info allow' ).  This spell is particularly useful if someone is in trouble
and out of spell points, or isn't high enough in level to 'fade'.

Abuses of this spell (i.e., summoning a new player into a room with "A Huge
Grizzly Player Eating Monster" ) will NOT be tolerated and will result in
demotion or banishment from the shadows, with a loss of experience points.
Mud-mail Blue if you have any problems with people summoning you.
