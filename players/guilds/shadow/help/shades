usage: 'shades'

'shades' creates a pair of sunglasses, your shadow shades.  These handy things
will do many things, but for now have only the following commands.

-'shades < on | off >' Turn your glasses off.  This makes it as though you 
                       didn't have any shades. ( You will grin evilly. )
-'new'                 Gets you a new pair of shades
-'SAY'                 Allows you to speak in BOLD type.  Costs 5 sp/shp.

   There are also special messages for emotes like 'grin', 'smile', etc.
   There will be more commands in the future.
   If you have ideas or improvements for any of the emotes, or anything, please
mud mail Blue.
