TRAIL

usage: 'trail' to drop a trail mark
            'back' to set the back direction
            'forward' to set the forward direction
            'track < forward or back> <number of markers>'

The trail commands offer a way to keep track of where you've been if
your in an unfamiliar area, or a way to leave an are quickly if you get
into trouble.  You can drop a marker in a room, set the 'back' direction
( the way to leave ) and a forward direction ( the way to go forward ).
If there are a string of these markers, you can use the track command 
to go forward or backward any number of markers.   Remember, when 
tracking, it is as if you were typing the directions to the computer, so if
you set the back of a marker to "eats" instead of "east", it will stop the
trail.
