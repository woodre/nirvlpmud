  The path of the circle is not an easy one, it is filled with hardship
and question.  Power will come slowly as you advance, and often times
you will feel lost.  The price of great power is great cost, do not
expect this forgotten path to be a simple one.  There are limits to
compensate for the excesses.

  Someone who chooses to follow this path, in order to focus and advance
their power, will not be able to use weapons.  Nor will one be able to
wear shields, or any armor which is too heavy, for all of these hamper
too greatly.  It requires great focus and endurance to master the
knowledge which lies within the circle.

  If you have further questions about this path you may seek out those
who already follow it, however do not expect a warm welcome.  This is a
guild of loners, of outcasts.  It is advisable that you have a strong
knowledge of your environment if you wish to succeed, for ignorance is
the death of every fool.  And always remember, everything has a price.
