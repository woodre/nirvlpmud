=New Beginning----

  For many years their society grew and prospered.  Never did any of their
former human opponents challenge them in their new home, as thus they
felt secure.  One man however, was destined to change the Order of the
Circle.  This man's name was Auseth.  He was a powerful wizard, a descendant
of the original elders who conquered the Mages of Darkon.  As time passed
he grew to hate his fellow man, as he felt they restrained him from the
ultimate powers of the circle.  This led Auseth to conceive a simple plan.

  The plan involved some of the darkest magic Auseth had ever dealt with,
magic that he had been forbidden to practice by the Elders of the Circle.
However this did not stop him.  Auseth discovered a powerful spell that would
allow him to cast a mighty curse on the lands, which would open a portal
into another plane filled with dark demons and evil beings.  Those
creature he knew would cause an upheaval among the humans.  But, that in
itself wasn't enough.  So Auseth sought the gurthers, journeying
beyond the great ocean..  searching..   until he found them.

  The gurthers had been constantly threatened by the humans, and when
Auseth found them their first inclination was to kill him and be done
with it.  However they feared retaliation, and so they listened to the
offer in which he presented.  He told of the powers in which he had
gained control of, and of how they could be used.  With the gurthers
fighting during the chaos that would ensue, he believed the humans could
be destroyed, and thus the gurthers could reclaim what belonged to them.
After many days, an agreement was made that would change the history of
the planet.
