You touch the symbol and seek within...


              The first symbol -   Power ----

  All life begins with power.  Without power there is nothing.  The
knowledge we have sealed within this circle is a path towards power.
We must have it, and thus, you must have it.  Should your body ever
be too weak, you will automatically sacrifice your own strength
to regain that power.  This can often be fatal to those who do not
listen, so always feed the hunger for power that dwells within you.
