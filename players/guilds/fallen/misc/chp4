  After that battle, peace settled over the lands again.  The curse
which had been cast still had the planet in its grasp, however the demons
only preyed on the weak.  They were not much of a threat to the gurthers,
who could defend themselves easily.  Auseth was a sort of hero to the
gurthers, however it did not matter to him.  There was a darkness deep
within him, that haunted his very existence.  It was a part of him he
could not deny.  Another strange side effect of such a powerful magic,
Auseth has aged timelessly in his tower ever since the war.  And there
he remains today.

  Those humans that survived up in the mountains turned away from the
ways of their ancestors, ignoring the teachings of the Circle.  Magic
became part of their history.  As time went on, the humans began anew 
in the mountains, and the gurthers once again were the dominant species 
of the planet.  Auseth remained in his tower, forever secluded with his 
madness.  According to the stories, the circle still remains somewhere
in the forests of the Fallen Lands...
