I coded something else for the fallen.  Originally it was just a cool emote
but I turned it into a spell.  They get it at 50k gxp.  For a sp cost of
10-59 they summon an obj to the room that slightly heals their endurance
if they're outside of combat.  Max endurance gain is about 8, or 10%.
Duration is directly related to gxp.  The goal with this is not to give
them a sp->end conversion spell, so if the numbers need tweaking (although
I don't think they do) then I'll certainly tweak.  Never did touch Vigor
and players seem to like it, although I had a helluva time using it as
a player.  Well, let me know.
