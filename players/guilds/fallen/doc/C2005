06.11 - added a new spell 'siphon' at 8m guild xp.  this channeled dmg
        spell also increases regen of hp/sp/end while sacrificing the
        ability to cast other spells in combat.  Requires a component
        which only Auseth carries but is storable and must be held in
        the inventory (approved by Verte).
06.11 - increased sp regen from 1+r(gxp/1.6m) to 2+r(gxp/1.6m) to somewhat
        compensate for their lack of increased sps (from years ago).
06.11 - added a new ability deweave to accompany shadowweave.  players can
        now remove the weave from a weapon in order to store it.  small
        sp/hp/end cost to cast.  not a learned spell in and of itself.
06.12 - Forbin added locker save code to the pouch so that a Fallen can
        store components over boots.  I see no reason why this shouldn't
        be in the game as it encourages the use of less common spells.
06.12 - Reduced dmg of siphon from 24 to 20 a hb and hp/sp regen from 18
        to 16 a hb.
06.19 - Added a hp check in hb.h so siphon wont kill a target
06.25 - Forbin rewrote the embrace code cause it wasn't working right.  It
        still seems to be broken, however now his version is broken instead
        of mine.  That's an improvement, right?
06.25 - Added a call_out to ~/realm/OBJ/siphon_stone.c that drains
        spell points from Fallen who carry it outside of combat.
06.26 - Modified Siphon / Siphon Stone.  The stone itself now drains
        sps when the owner is out of combat, anywhere from 25 to 78
        every 34 to 62 seconds.  Amount drained is based on level and
        the number of times siphon has been cast with the stone.
        Nerfed the initial dmg of siphon from 20/hb to 15, however
        with every 90 casts of siphon (excluding recasts) it gains 1
        total damage for a maximum of 15 + 11 = 26.  Made the stone
        store the variable and made additional cosmetic modifications.
        HP/SP regen also increase by 1/hb with every 180 casts of siphon,
        so they each start at 16 and max at 21 with 900 casts.  Also
        changed end bonus from 9/hb to 7-10/hb with every 270 casts.
06.29 - Per Forbin's suggestion I added a 'heat' variable to the stone which
        increases as the stone is used and decreases with time.  When it gets
        to over 36 it drains hp at the same time the stone drains sp.  Max dmg
        for one set of 7 dmg cycles, which is also max, is around 500 dmg.
      - Modified ste contrib to rage dmg formula since Fallen no longer get 30.
07.04 - Removed the new who2 spell.  can use mud who2 now.
