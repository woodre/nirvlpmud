Blood tells you: This, yes is a complaint

Blood tells you: I can't fight cost effectively with this drawback...i'm
using 1-2 more heals every fight just to cover so I don't
die when the mob is at 0/10

Blood tells you: maybe, we could get some sort of deathblow..because if I
have to cast focus just to finish a mob off

Blood tells you: as well as a magic spell

Blood tells you: It's next to impossible to keep up fighting, if you want to
make good forward motion in the guild

Blood tells you: (I.e killing worthwhile mobs)

Blood tells you: I consider myself a very experienced fighter, and that is
where the problem is coming in

Blood tells you: If you can't cast, you cast be effective, if your using mass
amounts of heals to be effective, that negates it as well

Blood tells you: Obviously I can't ask you to remove it, seeing as it

Blood tells you: is very effective in killing me

Blood tells you: I'm not sure who the players beta testing are

Blood tells you: Or how they are doing it

Blood tells you: But suggestions are welcome, cause i'm blowing upwards of
10k a kill lately

Blood tells you: I'm not exactly positive what i'm askin' here...right
now...yes i'm enjoying the guild

Blood tells you: But in the future, when i'm maxxed in it

Blood tells you: If the death continues like this...it's going to get old,
extremely quickly

Blood tells you: Now I don't know if i'll have this figured out by then

Blood tells you: But if I don't soon, i wont find out

Blood tells you: Does it have to be quite so severe?

Blood tells you: somthing like possibly taking the hp's and cutting them in
half of whatever they are

Blood tells you: don't get me wrong, I love the guild...but everything about
this one fundemental fights all of my fighting style

Blood tells you: Anyway, I wont lie and say i'm looking out for future
members, I'm just having a horrific time with it...and if
you can believe it, it really isn't the xp's and levels that
are bothering me, it's that it's totally ripping me apart
and I don't feel I can control it
