************************** Year 2002 *****************************************
4.16 - Added a pk sort to the who2 command that shows location.  Approved in
       advance by Maledicta.
     - Made it so you can focus while using a weapon.  Adds a wc bonus based
       on duration of focus remaining.  Also approved by Mal.
4.17 - Added some combat messages relating to focus + weapon usage.
     - Vigor tweaks: hi/med/low (wc +6, +4, +3), (end bonus +10, +6, +6)
4.18 - Tweaked vigor a bit more, updated vigor help file in this dir
4.19 - Added spell delay code and embrace spell at 7 mil gxp.
       Approved by Vertebraker.  Updated help.h, seek.h.
     - Added news history file for general info players should have.
       This is accessed through the guildhall with 'seek facts'
4.22 - Modified shadowcloak to take -1 sp/hb 1:2 after 5.2m and 1:3 after
       7.8m gxp rather than -1 sp/hb every hb
     - Modified rage to cost up to 20 sp less based on guild_exp.
       New sp cost is 90 + random(50) - (gxp / 400000)
     - Modified dark assistance to have a 1:8 chance of ending once the
       player is out of combat rather than 1:1, and made it so there is
       a 1:2 or 2:3 chance of the player gaining 1 endurance while it is
       active based on gxp.
     - Modified teleport to take arguments.  Players can teleport to 7
       different locations within the Fallen Lands.  If used within the
       Fallen Lands teleport is unaffected by NT rooms.
     - Added in a 'stop casting' command.  If they are casting a spell
       and they run it will end, however they will take damage as a
       result.  If they stop it manually there is no penalty.
4.23 - Removed the ability to teleport from NT rooms in the mist circle in
       the Fallen Lands.  Verte pointed this out, as it was something I
       had overlooked.
     - Added in Verte's component pouch which lets fallen merge 2+ pouches
       in their inventory together into 1.
5.08 - made spell failure less likely to occur.  added +20 to the formula.
       also raised the minimum chance of failure from 30 to 45.

       in the guild with 8 mil gxp.  excluded[] is an array for testchars

6.12 - added ~/heals/delaa.c to the grove, which heals endurance slightly
6.13 - doubled endurance regen on shadows.c (from 1 to 2)
     - increased shadowblast endurance cost from 1 to 1.5
10.31 - commented out increased attribs from advance.h due to changes
        to the way attribs work on Nirvana.
