DERVISH ABILITY - SANDBLAST <enemy>

Cost: 40-70
Level: 19 + 10
Delay: Small

Function:

The ultimate Master ability is attained only by those who have given themselves
completely to the Sands. Those enemies who have enfuriated the Master will find
a torrent of sand ripping through any protection.  Indeed, armors may even
become weaker as a result of a fully trained Master.
