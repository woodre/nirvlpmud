LORE OF THE DERVISH

Part 1:  The Whirling Sands

Sands. The sands are eternal.
Whirling, whipping, screaming their desire.
Embracement.  Strip away all vestments.
Rip away the past.
Initiate. Impuissant delicacy.
Through pain, learning.
Mystic. Pain is overcome.
Screams rise again, healing.
Master. Whirling.
Blood sprays.
The sands are eternal.
