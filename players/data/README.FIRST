These are LPC Manuals I picked up from a WWW site. 
they explain lpc coding basics, etc. They were not 
written for Nirvana but for other muds. Any rules etc
mentioned in these files do not apply here, rather 
refer to the Nirvana doc. If the subject is not covered
by nirvana doc ask Boltar or Sandman.
