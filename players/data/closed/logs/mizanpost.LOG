     The Grand Hall of the CyberNinja lies before you.
Columns of raging fire stand along the sides of the black
marble floor.  Gigantic red statues of past ninja warriors
cast their flickering shadows upon the high white walls.
The Hall is circular in shape, with the ceiling tapering to
a glass dome overhead.
    There are five obvious exits: north, east, west, up and down

The note is titled 'Polys, neck faces, and other randomness(mizan)':


Doodle is correct. Just because polymorphs are my guild does not mean they
are automatically getting favored treatment. They are fair game if you want
to blick them in PK areas. I neither encourage nor discourage you from
targeting them. The only thing that would annoy me is if a Poly somehow had
the ability to initiate combat. They are not supposed to.

It does not mean i don't care if they die- it just means i am aware about
finer game elements such as character separation.

Speaking of character separation, i do not appreciate wizards who on guild
lines that are dictating guild policy. If it did not come from Puppy or myself
then it should be checked with us in order.

That sort of neckfaced activity will get squitted faster than a fecally
enriched EEPROM chip burnt with buggy code.

I am still a newbie at this. Please feel free to comment about things.
I do read your ideas and am taking things to heart. A lot of issI do read your ideas and am taking things to heart. A lot of issues are still
in the air and once work settles down a bit i'll try to restart serious work
on the guild.

Thanks for reading.
