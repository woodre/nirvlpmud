The Paladins are subject to the two drawbacks as
described in the Overview.

1)  Once a Paladin chooses an alignment, they must
    abide by that set alignment, or their powers
    will fail.  So, if you choose to be good and
    suddenly find yourself neutral, then none of
    your Paladin powers will function.

2)  When a Paladin receives over 50,000 coins, the
    amount over that will disappear as a sacrifice
    for their power.
