The path of the Knight is that of the most well-rounded of 
warriors.  They excel in defense, offense, and the ability 
to size up an opponent and destroy them.  The Knight is bred
for war and glory, seeking this relentlessly at any chance
they see.  A Knight is a knowledgeable commander also, leading
the troops into battle with near flawless strategies. War
is for Knights.
The following skills will be of great assistance when 
attempting to move into the Knight's path:
1) Edged/Blunt/Polearm - Weapon skills that will assist greatly
              in a knights future.

2) Block - A shield is a Knights best friend. Use it.

3) Strike/bash - Two fighting abilities that set up a Knight to
           succeed.
