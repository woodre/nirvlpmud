The Berserker is the Warrior profession to the extreme.  It has the
ability to summon the powers of rage, allowing them to rip apart
opponents and ignore physical pain.  As an offensive killing machine
this path is one to be feared, however, defensively the Berserker
has a 24/7 deathwish.  It is believed that the rage is almost magical
in nature, being impossible for anyone to even survive such an
emotional maelstrom.  
The following is a listing of skills in the Warrior profession that
will assist in the Berserker path:
1) Any Weapon proficiency

2) Charge  - A necessary for the Berserker path.

3) Strike  - A nice assist when dealing damage.
