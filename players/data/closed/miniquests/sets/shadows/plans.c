set of Shadows
meant for basically pking, modeled as an assassin setup

armors
 

Tunic of Shadows- Increases stealth when worn by 3, but takes 5 dex and 2 sta to compensate
                 


Cloak of Shadows - With hood up it will say for your name, a dark figure wrapped
                   in shadows,
                 kinda like fred's black circle mages. Theme wise an assassin
                 doesn't want to be recognized out in the open. 

Gauntlet of Shadows - defense specials

Boots of Shadows -  sneak around, no exit/enter messages

Ring of Shadows - Let's you see how hurt your target is even when not in the same
                 room. Must be 'hunting' though.

Talisman of Shadows - heals sp every hb



WEAPONS

a knife, not sure what to name it yet
type small, knife

This knife is only meant to use on a player's corpse to cut off something, I
dunno yet what, but what is cut is meant for providing proof that a target
has been assassinated, or kept as a trophie. I want to make the trophie savable
and to keep the short description so if it says "blah of data" before stored
it will say it after a restore. This way if the person who "hired" the hit will
have their proof that it was done. However I must somehow make it so that only
way to obtain proof is from a player's corpse, and the assassin has to of been
the one to kill them or else it wont work....no pickin off of a person's corpse
from dying to a mob. 

Fang of Shadows
type small, dagger
ability to drain corpses to power up
energy used for certain things such as poisonings, increased speed (hit
multiple times in the same round), life drainage from the poisoning and infused
to the wielder (endurance for warriors/bloodfist also if ok with higher ups).
secondly, it will be impossible to wield two of these weapons since a player
can only earn one of these and any others they may find won't belong to them. 
somewhere I want to also make it so that if a person attempts to "flee" such as
leaving manually, portaling out, running, etc will hurt the person, they will
have a chance of running but while poisoned it may slow them down until it wears
off. So if a person thinks they will run from green to their lockers for safety
and they just mash the keys without paying attention they can get turned around
or even lost while the pker finishes them off. 

Abilities as listed

lifetap - power, set, activation/deactivation
venom - power, set, activation/deactivation, but low chance of going off
speed - power, set, activation/deactivation
flee prevention - 
                  wielder -  no power,set or no set, no way of turning off, 100%
                  unable to flee, 
                  
                  fighting against - power, set, activation, theme wise the venom
                  and power of the dagger attempts to prevent them from running. 

corpse drain - powers up, set, command

As for life force max, I will leave undetermined for testing purposes, and once
ability life force cost per round, how much is gained by draining corpses, and
the weapon's max is figured, ill set the max, for testing purposes all costs
per round will be 1 while corpse will be set at feldegast's stone. max will be
thousands, when items are ready and it is time to figure the costs then the 
values will change. 

How to get

Idealy I will set up a system similar to the quests, called mini quests.
This is for questing of items instead of questing for points for wizardhood.
This will be located in the wizard's keep (yet to be created). A wizard mob will
tell the player about the set and any "key" words to look for. Afterwards the
player has to search the libraries of the wizard's keep for hints on where to go.
I might even make a couple "hidden" libraries in my areas like in the land of
the nightwhisps to give special tips or even directions on how to use the items.
The items will be scattered throughout my area, some easy to find, others hard depending
on how good the item is and it's theme. For example the mrswith cloak can only
be obtained in the hagen woods from a mrswith, finding it will be hard as the
mobs are "invisible", and move freely. I also might make it so certain items
can only be obtained in certain weather/seasons if I create a weather system
for my area. I want to make getting these items difficult, but well worth the 
effort to get, and to be used as a badge for their exploring/fighting skills.
As with the wizard's keep, many books are kept there to give players ideas on
where to look for what, but they also have to find the info themselves. All that
I ask is that the same penalties apply to quests in terms of wizards and their alts
divulging information about these mini quests to keep things fair. Further more
when a player earns the items he can never go into those areas again thats designated
as miniquest areas, this will prevent them from assisting others in getting the
items like weakening a mob down to 0 and having the other person finish em off.
Also whoever defeats the mob will gain ownership of the item in question, making
it so that only the owner can use the weapon or armor, let alone pick it up. 
this way no guild max level maxed polymorphs who think their bad asses by 
blicking everything in the game in dark tetrapod mode handing out death set 
items like its candy to low levels....(no names)....ok so im talking about one 
of my alts so sue me. This way the players have to actually earn it and not beg
me...errr sin for it. As for replacements incase of accidental loss or being
unable to get their sets back a friendly wizard at the wizard's keep also cast
a spell on the items called recall, if the items can be brought back, meaning
not in a locker system, then he will cast recall and they can have their gear back,
but not without a significant price and this is as follows.

First another miniquest, simple but thematic as you are searching for a spell
component for the wizard. This miniquest can be done more than once.

Secondly, the price is 2 million coins, which of course normally a player can't 
carry that much at one time, but the bank of nirvana can....so something will
be set up there, since right now all its really good for is buying land, why not
something else?



Other sets to come as my area grows, each with its own theme and uses for most
of the guilds, the ones that can use armor and weapons anyways. Ill brain storm
ideas for those that can't, and ideas are welcome. 

Thinking of something for healers since they are weak in fighting. Somehow create
a hack that might make it easier to gain xp for them with a set of their own.
To obtain the set instead of fighting, they must heal things in my areas with
items specific to my area...such as finding herbs and using them correctly to heal
the mobs, the mobs can be sick, hurt from broken bones, require stitching, etc. 
The healer must learn what they need to heal these mobs correctly. After they
are healed the mob will offer clues on items, some might even offer the item
for graditude for saving their life. To learn about herbs and how to heal in my
area they must go to the wizard's keep and read the required books.
