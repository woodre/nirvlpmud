As for the mini quest portion, to get started you must first "make" the fangs,
you do so by first killing a mob that I have yet to plan, and you take it's fangs.
Then other items to imbuene it with powers and such, which you will have to take to
a wizard mob to cast the spells and create the weapon. Once done and you obtain
possession of the dagger it will speak to you in your mind, telling you that if
you want additional power, you must earn it, and will then give you hints on
the rest of what you need. In each part where you gain an item at this point
the fangs will act as a key unlocking doors, or warning of traps until all items
are obtained. Furthermore for items you have to kill for the mob must be killed
by the fangs, or else the key items will destruct. 

After all the items are obtained, you take them to another wizard mob, and they
will tie all the items together, making them more powerful when they are all
used. 


For individual items themselves there will be level restrictions, some items will
only be usable from a higher level. Eventually though I want to create a mud wide
mini quest for the set of legends, meant for level +100 players and only useable for them.
Just the ability to even start the quest you have to have the level, as entering the
mini quest portions will be blocked without it. To start the legends mini quest
will require the legends test, something similar to etest so that they can choose
their weapon type. I want to be able to make this particular mini quest for all
so some ideas would be useful since not every guild can wear the same armors. 
Such as guilds with dual wield would prefer to dual wield than to have a shield
for any reason, so to them there is no point of doing a particular mini quest. 
As for guilds that dont wear armors or use weapons....someone else can think
of something for them to mini quest for...im pooped.


I want to make it so that most of if not all the items can only be gotten once
per player, and that the items can only be used by the owner...but what if that
person loses his hard earned items? In that case he can go to the wizard mob
that tied them together and will use a "recall web" to bring the items back, in
either cloning new ones to replace ones lost in boots or in actuall transport of
the items to the room, either case it will be quiet expensive to do, the more
powerful the set items, the higher the cost. The cash portion with hopefully some
help from other fellow wizards will get deducted from the bank of nirvana. This
is why I said a very high cost, 80k is easy to get, but 500k, 1 million? that takes
effort, and unless the person already has the cash in the account, he will just
have to rearmor and weapon himself the hard way, make the money and save up. 
In this way, by denying the ability to get new replacements by redoing the 
mini quest, it also makes it unable for them to get it for other players, so there
won't be level 10's going around with a set that they can't get on their own.
I might also have it so that there is a mob with a spell component that the
wizard mob will need to cast his spell, as the wizard mob won't of had much
reason to do this very much and won't bother to keep stocked, this component
won't be saveable.  



To make things a little easier though for the high prices I want to somehow
make it so that if the person dies those items will drop to the ground
instead of being moved to a corpse, they will also be unable to be put into
a bag, this way no one can steal the gear and put it in a hotel room where
the person cant get it or trash it. Likewise the owner won't be able to give
it to anyone or put into a bag.
