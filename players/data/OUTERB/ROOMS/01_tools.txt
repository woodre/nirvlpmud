I may or may not be your sponsor, so if this conflicts with
something else you have been instructed or have been told by
another, do it their way. A lot of differences that exist from
coder to coder are stylistic and do not have a lot of bearing
on the way the actual code works. They do have importance
though, in the areas of readability, documenation, etc.

The first things I would suggest involves things only
indirectly related to coding, namely: finding and using a
good text editor and learning how to ftp your code to the
mud. Editting your code offline, on your own machine is much
easier to start with and makes tracking down errors easier.
[opinion: mine]

Text Editors:

    If you are using a unix box [linux, Free/OpenBSD, etc] I
    can't recommend the emacs program highly enough. It handles
    syntax/language coloring, indentation, reformatting, etc,
    etc, etc very well. [included in most default installs]
    
    For MacOS I would suggest the very good and very free,
    TextWrangler. It offers syntax/language color, powerful text
    tools, glossaries, customizations out the wazoo and can edit
    files remotely via ftp.

    For Windows I would suggest an good program called "Crimson
    Editor" and has auto-indent, colorizing reserved words and
    good search and replace functionality necessary for a good
    text editor. It is currently located at:
    <http://crimsoneditor.com/>
    
    Another excellent text editor for use is called PFE. It's out
    of production, but it really is a nice text editing tool. It
    can be found at
    <http://downloads.zdnet.co.uk/downloads/download/1003-2352-
    904159.html>

    Additional free text editors can be found from this page:

FTP programs:

    If you are using a unix box you probably don't have any
    trouble getting a ftp program working to your specs.
    
    For MacOS you can choose from several good shareware ftp
    clients. The freeware market is bit more sparse. Only the
    RBrowser Lite is worth its salt.
    
    For Windows, CuteFTP is the best, but shareware. There are
    several free ftp clients that can be found online.
    
    The ftp login is similar to the mud, but port 3000. So from
    a command line you would type: ftp nirvana.mudservices.com
    3000 and then login with your name and password as usual. In
    graphical ftp client you'll probably need to check for an
    option to create a passive connection [it may be listed as
    [PASV] to the mudftp server.

All this and I still haven't helped w/ any coding...ha... sorry

Next installment will have actual code!
