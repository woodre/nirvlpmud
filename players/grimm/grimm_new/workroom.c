/*   This is a generic wiz workroom.  It has a number of examples
	that should help you get started. Before you get too far along,
	you should change 'your_name' to your real name. (i.e I would
	change 'your_name' to "eurale")  I've tried to include things
	that most people want to add so look through and if you still
	have questions, contact someone for help.  Enjoy  -Eurale
