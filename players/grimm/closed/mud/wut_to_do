To instate the quest_ok stuffs just:
  1.    cp /players/grimm/closed/mud/quest_ok.c /obj/quest_ok.c
  2.    ed /room/adv_guild.c
  3.    insert the line:
               #include "/obj/quest_ok"
        at the top of the file
  4.    insert the following at line 254:
               if(!quest_ok(next_lvl)) return 1;
  5.    exit the editor, load, and update the adv_guild
this will take care of advancing and a bug found on another mud where the
player could get their exp high enough, die, and pray to SKIP the questing
part.
