Coolant is used to cool the truck's engine, gun barrels, and nuke launchers.
If you run low on coolant your truck will begin to sustain damage and may even
blow up.  During normal sitting (with no shooting or nukes) 1 canister of 
coolant will last you for 5 minutes, but every bullet that is shot you loose
1 second off of that 5 minutes and for every nuke that is done; you loose
100 seconds.  The remote will alert you periodically when you are below 30
seconds worth of coolant, just "buy 7" to get another canister.  You start
with 1 canister of coolant and can have up to 10 canisters.
