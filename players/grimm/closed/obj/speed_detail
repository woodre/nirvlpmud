Speedster v.2.0  (c) Grimm Enterprises, Inc.
 
The idea behind the speedster is to let you the player speed up your normal
direction running (i.e. if you go from the pub to somewhere in the mud 400 
times in a session you can do it in a flash (and avoid the lag that may
occur)).  A suggestion for using the speedster is that you may want to turn
"brief" on and let it run its path and then switch back to "verbose" mode
(do this by typing "brief" (it toggles between the two modes)).
 
An example of using the speedster:
Go to the church and type "learn shop s,e,e,e,n"
then type "go shop"
finally type "backtrack shop"
 
this will let you run the 3 main parts of the speedster.
 
NOTE: This is version two of the Speedster.  You may enter any command to be
      executed in the learned path, but the backtrack function will only work
      if ALL the commands in the path are cardinal directions.
