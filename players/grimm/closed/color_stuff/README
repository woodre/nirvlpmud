To install the color online you only need to:
  1. read and do what is noted in "put_in_player.c"
  2. read and do what is noted in "put_in_inherited_files"
  3. copy the file "color_func.h" to /obj/color_func.h
  4. copy the file "color_help" to /doc/efun/color_help
       (which will be added later on, once all this is approved and tested)
