The line:
  #include "/obj/color_func.h";
should be put in the folowing inheritted files:
  /room/room.c
  /obj/treasure.c
  /obj/weapon.c
  /obj/armor.c
  /obj/monster.c
  /obj/monster.talk.c
  and any others you can think of that are inheritted on a normal basis
  ("special" files made by the wizzies can have the include line in it
  on the initiative of the wizz (more will be noted on that in the help
  file included in this directory))
