    [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]
         
     Within his first couple of years as a member of the Healers,
     Sagan discovered how to contact the Realm of Death through the
     sacrifice of body parts to appease the spirits there. He
     built a couple of secret chambers deep within the Hall, to
     expirement upon the fresh corpses he dug up within the 
     graveyard of a nearby town. Sagan also discovered a thick 
     and ancient tome, detailing the use of necromantic arts to
     cast offensive and defensive spells.

     It wasn't long after Sagan began his delve into the necromantic
     arts that Rose Vyr discovered the secret chambers and banished
     him from the Hall. Sagan tried to give a weak explaination as  
     to using the abilities he gained to further the power of the
     Healers, but Rose would not hear of it. A great fight broke
     out, with Sagan being banished from the area of the Hall on a
     permanent basis. Sagan swore vengance upon both Rose and the 
     Healers and then set out to further his power.
