    [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]
         
     If you are reading this I'll assume you have managed your way
     into becoming a Necromancer.  Very few have found this path
     until recently, so much of its history was lost through the
     passage of time.  Not to long ago, though, I decided it needed
     to be written down.  Hopefully setting the record straight, but
     also to maybe start a thirst for more to seek out the truth of
     what really happened.

     You see, much of what I know is only hearsay.  Scattered thoughts
     and memories of mine and those whom I have taken from.  But even
     as I piece them together much of the story is untold and perhaps,
     lost forever.  I might emplore you to search out and find the 
     things that I do not even know, but if you are unwilling to do
     that you may at least find some comfort in the knowledge that I 
     can bestow.
