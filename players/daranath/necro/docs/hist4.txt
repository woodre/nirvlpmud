    [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]
         
     Sagan ruled over Qual'tor for almost 80 years, passing off
     any questions of his age by letting the populace know that
     he was of elven decent. Qual'tor grew into a strong and   
     powerful city within Nirvana, although they were continously 
     plagued by holy warriors and clerics looking to stamp out the
     evil that dwelt within the city. A man by the name of Tarkos
     arrived in Qual'tor soon thereafter, and he was able to convince
     the citizens of the dark arts being run by Sagan. This led to
     a general uprising, people who were tired of Sagan's dark 
     ways. Sagan was forced from power and fled the city with
     his life barely intact. Sagan was gone...

     Now, over 300 years later, Qual'tor lies in ruins. The once great
     city stands only in memory, blackened buildings and the burnt
     out husk of the great keep is all that remains. The necromancers
     kept their stronghold intact through the years, even though
     thier numbers grew smaller and smaller over time. Today, they
     grow in number again, bringing the dark arts back to Nirvana.
