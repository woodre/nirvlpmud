    [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]

     In the following pages are a list of the spells gained at 
     certain levels as was dictated by what Sagan wanted.  After
     striking a deal with the Realm of Death, he soon convinced them
     to allow mortals, willing to follow in his path, these steps
     of power.  The Realm of Death finally saw the wisdom of this
     in an effort to gain more power for themselves. While there are 
     spells that fall outside of these plateau, those are much harder 
     to discover and are only granted by truely impressing the Realm
     of Death.
