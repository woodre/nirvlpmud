It has been a refuge and place of peace for my tortured soul.  The realm of death has taught mewell....and I have prospered.  You too will do well to learn from the RoD. (Realm of Death)  All you need is contained inthis chamber.  Search it out.  If you find problems or errors,you may notify the RoD using 'nbug (message)'.  There is no one other than the RoD to guide us.  We each must find ourown way.  There are no rules, only the books.  If we chance tomeet in the realm of the living, so be it. **[1m...                                      [2;37;0m ( Sickness ):**I have finally found a way to be one with my deepest of torments.Thank you Mantis.SKNS**[1mKnowledge                                [2;37;0m ( Sid ):**Others can not give you the knowledge.The knowledge must come from the realm and from within.**[1mDeath's Dagger                           [2;37;0m ( Sagan ):**The dagger that you can claim from the Realm of Death is not mainly for the killing of foes, but more so for the ability to remove those precious components from theirliveless body.  It is for that reason that the Realm of Death supplies you witha very small and precise harvesting tool.  -Sagan**[1mLibrary of Knowledge                     [2;37;0m ( Mikoyose ):**The books are in the library for reference, for everyone.  Please refrain from toteing them around for extended periods.  Also the information contained in the books is for necromancers or those that would join us.  Therefore, please do not simply leave them sitting out in other parts of the realm.  Leave the books in the library if at all possible, for the sake of everyone involved.May death come swiftly,Mikoyose**[1mGuild Hall                               [2;37;0m ( Sagan ):**The guild hall has become more unfriendly to all.  -Sagan**[1mDark Honor                               [2;37;0m ( Grog ):**I am proud to have become a member of the Order of the Necromancer.I wil always uphold the Dark Honor and will never disgrace or leavethe Order.
