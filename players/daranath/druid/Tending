basic overview of tending

Guild hall comes in a main groves and private groves that are connected. Players can use the tend skill in both of them, to get Touch of Nature points. The main hall is the same for all the players, with the board...  etc   The main hall also randomly spawns "items" that players can take to thier private groves.
 
In the private groves is where players get the most power. There are 5 slots that can be filled buy Items, which can be a tree, bush, plant, flower or waterstone. They will show in the guildhall long. Players tend (like your monk meditate) and build touch points, plus the Items grow and age. These private groves do not reset, but stay active all the time, wether the druids are online or not. IF a grove goes untended, the druid will loose Touch points, and weeds will pop up in the slots and kill the Items
 
Also, while tending, the individual Items (except for trees) will give off spell components, so a druid must pick and choose the Items to plant. There are 7 different components, and they are needed for the butt kicking spells. This whole process will take a HUGE beta to get balanced, but in the end, it should wind up pretty cool
 
Game Stats: Every 5 hbts, Chance of Touch point = (30 + (plant skill *5) + (total tree age *2) as a percent
 
Trees can age 7 slots....   all other items (except stream) can age 3
 
Everytime a touch percent is successful, there is a 1 in 500 chance of a random Item gaining an age category.

Items that can be planted: Tree, Bush1, Bush2, Plant, Flower and Waterstone
   Trees have 7 age categories, which add to the success rate of Tending
   Bush1 is mistletoe bush, with age 1 and 2 giving lesser comps
     age 3 giving greater comps
   Bush2 is berries bush, with all ages giving comps
   Plant is herb plants, which can be harvested into components
   Flower is useless right now, just looks good
   Waterstone can be planted into private groove to make stream for Pure Water comp
