Future dir of the Gundar Wastes

Newbie/Low level area. Randomly loading monsters in most rooms, no shop to 
  purchase anything, although a merchant will take stuff for sale.
Players greater then level 15 cannot enter the area. Area is realm() NT too 
  prevent follow from players higher then 15.

Wastes are split into 3 sub-areas, each with its own race
  Caves are goblin infested
  Lava Pits have evil Salamanders
  Gundar Cliffs have Faerl problems

End of Caves and Lava pits has boss monster with AC2 item (helm for pits and
  ring for caves). All other armors ac1, save for a couple of 'armor' type ac3
  items on random monsters. No AC2 items found here are savable.

Players can find heals on some monsters after they kill them, but all are minor,
  low-powered heals of little value.
