The mines on the southeastern corner of the Warlord's mountain

The mines go down a total of 5 levels, with level 1 being the
first and highest level, as well as the easiest for players
(i.e. low level) - where as level 5 is the deepest of the mines
and also the toughest for players to make it out alive from.

Level 5 of the mines also connects to the fortress of giants,
which will be in progess soon.

Level 2 of the mines connects to the UnderDark (level 1) near
the myconid farm.
