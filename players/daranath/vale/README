Lotus Vale, second of my new areas after the Gundar Wastes (/wastes)

Lotus Vale is a vast wooded area with a large lake in the east. The monsters
  randomly load into the forest, with a couple of set areas including a gnoll
  encampment, druid circle and the island itself. A group calling itself the
  Cabal has a citadel set up here, for players to invade.

Lotus Vale will house several items of my forthcoming quest, to restore the
  ancient king of Qual'tor. The vault of the citadel will have the Catalyst Stone
  which the Cabal is using as a magical power source.
