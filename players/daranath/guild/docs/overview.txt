              NECROMANCERS
---------------------------------------------------------
     Necromancer Guild Overview

The Necromancer guild here upon Nirvana is one of the dark and
most disturbing of the guilds to join. Not necessarily because
the Necromancers run around the world killing other players and
kicking babies in the face, but because of the way that guild
members gain thier powers. The spells and powers of the guild
are obtained through the sacrifice of body parts that have been
harvested from a corpse. These parts are then used to open a
magical channel from Nirvana to the Realm of Death. The Realm of
Death then grants the Necromancers their spells which can be used 
offensively, defensively or for other functions while adventuring
upon Nirvana.
