TotalCost tracks the total spell points it takes to cast each
spell for the Necros. The true spell points are added to the
effective cost for the spell components. Spell comps are 
figured by the following values:

1 part Blood  2 Spell Points
1 part Skin   8 Spell Points
1 part Eye   20 Spell Points
1 part Heart 30 Spell Points
1 part Spine 30 Spell Points
1 part Soul  40 Spell Points

Example - Chill costs 10 sp plus 1 Blood, TotalCost of 12
