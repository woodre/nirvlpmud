              NECROMANCERS
---------------------------------------------------------
     Value to the Realm of Death

One of the important things that most Necromancers forget
about is that the Realm of Death allows a Necromancer to use
power that truely belongs to the spirit world. Thusly, the
Realm keeps track of the various spells that are cast and
when a Necromancer shows proficiency with those spells, 
then they are allowed to move onto the next level. This
is shown within your Necromancer score (nscore or nsc).
When the Realm of Death is pleased, you are allowed to 
advance your guild level, provided you have enough experience
saved up....

Note1 -> The Realm of Death favors certain spells over others
         It especially dislikes those spells that do not come
         from the Realm of Death itself.
