     Summon Harvesting Tool (miscellaneous)

In order to collect or harvest the parts properly from a
corpse, a Necromancer needs what is commonly refered to as
the harvesting tool. The tool itself is a wicked little blade
with diamond making up its curving edge. This spell allows
a necromancer to summon his tool to his side, no matter where
the blade currently lies. Basic Necromancer Spell.
