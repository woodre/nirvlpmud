---------------------------------------------------------
     Sphere of Anguish (offensive)

Sphere of Anguish was the follow up to Spectral Grasp in the
Necromancers efforts to defend themselves. The Sphere tears
through its target, regardless of armor, making it an effective
spell against more 'civilized' opponents.
Basic Necromancer Spell.

Note -> This spell can be used against other players
Note2 -> The Realm of Death is not always pleased when a 
         Necromancer abandons its spells for others.
