     Joining the Necromancer Guild

Joining the Necromancer guild here upon Nirvana is a very simple 
process indeed. There are just a few requirements...

A player must not already be affiliated with any guild

A player must be at least level 5

If a player is greater then level 5, they will then be asked to sacrifice all
their experience already gained past 10k, and have their level reset to 5.

Any player who meets the above requirements can join the guild. Upon joining,
every player agrees to the few guild rules (see rules).If a player does not
wish to be reset to level 5, or abide by the guild rules, they do not have
to join.
