              NECROMANCERS
---------------------------------------------------------
     Roleplaying within the Necromancer Guild

Roleplaying within the guild is not something that will be
forced upon anyone who joins the Necromancers. However, if
another character wishes to roleplay his/her necromancer
throughout the time they are on Nirvana, please do not 
interfere with thier wishes. They only time that roleplaying
will be encouraged or discouraged will be if it comes in 
conflict with the base rules of the guild (see rules).
