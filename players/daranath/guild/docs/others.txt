              NECROMANCERS
---------------------------------------------------------
     Necromancer Opinions on the Others (nirvana guilds)

Necromancers have not been around long enough to form solid
opinions on most of the other guilds here upon Nirvana.
However, a couple of current guilds do not mix
well with the Necromancers...

Healers - The Healers are the antithisis of everything the
          Necromancers stand for. They threw Sagan out from 
          the "Hall", when he was just trying to increase
          thier power (see hist1 thru hist4). Healers are
          not liked throughout the Necromancer Guild.

Knights Templar - The templar knights take a high opinion on
          what is 'right' and what is 'wrong' here on Nirvana,
          despite the fact they don't seem to know half of
          the time themselves. Its always fun to show one
          of those walking tin cans the true meaning of
          power.
