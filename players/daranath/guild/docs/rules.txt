              NECROMANCERS
---------------------------------------------------------
The Rules of the Necromancer Guild, per Daranath

1- I will not allow a member of my guild to swear or use any
   language that in not allowed upon the gossip channel. It
   is not something I like, and I will not stand for it.
   The same goes for emotes and talking over the open channels,
   except for on risque or the star channel.

2- A necromancer will not steal a corpse from another 
   necromancer. A corpse is the source of the guild's power, 
   and is the most precious thing to the guild. 

3- If a bug within the guild is discovered, I will reward any
   necromancer that reports it. This goes to typos, spells or
   anything else that I might have missed or overlooked.
   NOT REPORTING A BUG IS A VIOLATION OF GUILD RULES

A player will be warned once, then thrown from the guild. If
you cannot live by these simple rules, you should not be here.
