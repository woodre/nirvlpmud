     Spectral Grasp Spell (offensive)

Spectral Grasp was developed long ago by the Necromancers as a
defensive spell for use against the many holy warriors and 
priests that wanted to abolish all contact with the Realm of
Death. When used, the grasping spell causes a Necromancers
hand to grow insubstantial, ignoring armor and other defenses.
