tmp_text "Greetings...The Necromancers are currently in Beta Testing, which meansthat the guild is open, but only to 5 members. Those 5 membersare gonna help me determine if the guild is balanced andhelp me to stamp out all the bugs...  I will be adding more flash and substance to the guild as time goes by...  do not worry. New spells will also make an appearance, as theguild grows with members and in power.Any suggestions and/or ideas will be helpfull. Mail me orpost here upon the board...   -Daranath ColdsBlood, Lord of the Necromancers**The componets do not have any direct value to a non-necro. But they do have a value to each other. I was asked to postthis listing.Assume that the standard unit is 1 blood4 blood = 1 Skin10 blood = 1 eye15 blood = 1 spine15 blood = 1 heart20 blood = 1 soulI hope that helps, especially during harvesting times   -Dar**I am indeed taking suggestions for more portals in the chamberto the north of here.  Post them, mail me or tell me if I amaround...   -Dar**Couple of things are being changed/added1 - Command word for Jester's Caress of Shadows will be 'shadow'   instead of 'caress'. This is so it does not interfere with   other caress commands.   (they are out there)2 - I am adding a command into the pouch called 'store all'.   This will allow you to put all the components into the    pouch all at once. Saves time and your keyboard3 - RoD = Realm of Death, just so no-one is confusedMore to follow....   -Dar**I am very happy to have this guild up and running. I've waited a long timefor this guild to open and it's the best guild on the mud as far as I'm conserned, I've completed a list of things that I've seen that might aidin the advancement of characters and the guild...1. take time to stock up on all things in your pouch, it saves time later  trust me.2. remember to watch your wform, if it goes out in battle that sucks very  bad. 3. I think there should be some guild emotes if there's not already. I love   guild emotes.4. Daranath is the bomb!5. I would love to hear about the adventures of yourselves via, other players  and other guilds. My take is that we dislike the healers. But I'd love to  here your take on the subject.6. maybe insteed of a store all there should be an auto store command, just  a thought.more info as it comes :) bye necrosLord Tallos**I think its a great idea that the guild has a series of emotes,or at least changing the current ones so players know you area Necromancer. If you have any ideas, examples or specific emotes you would like to see, let me know. I'll give it a coupledays to let you give some input...   -Dar**Things that I am currently working on for the guild...Store all with the component pouchnew spell -> Plague (probably level 3)new spell -> Minor Animation (level 4?)new spell -> Major Animation (level 8?)new spell -> gravepact (level 1)new spell -> Dark Intrusion (level 10)Couple of other things too...     -Darbagger, badder, better....**Spell has been increased to 100 spell points for right now...It will be reset soon  -Dar**posting on this board does now that i know ppl will post illcheck it.  The spell it does give you something but the benifits arenteven close to the sacrifice.. so no..             -wocket**could you post up a current list of costs for the spells?**These are the spells that i have updated and changed.    Bloodmoo - 10sp 1 heart 1 blood    Chill - 10sp 1 blood    Consume - 20sp 1 blood    Drain - 20sp 1 eye  Embalm (formally preserve) - 2 blood  Grasp - 15sp 2 blood (currently offline)  buryme - now takes 3 skins to enter an open grave (still under construction)That is the current uptodate list of the ones ive changed so far.   -wocket**i need to know why i can't advance my glevel when i have the exp necessary to do so.... also is it possible that we can get a peace spell of some sort?**with the bury_me command gone and the dig grave in use i think it would be great if we could get a shovel coded into the guild so we could bury ourselves in our graves.**is there any chance we can get an updated list of spells and component costs please.... getting up with all the new differences in my head is starting to get annoying.  thanks**It occurs to me that a useful feature would be a guild storage system.Instead of having a locker, we can have some other way to store stuff.I thought of 2 things: 1) buy a safe for some amount, and it can hold afixed number of items. But since it's your safe, there's no per-item costfor storage or retrieval.2) We use a variant of raise to create a "valet" out of a preserved corpse.It doesn't move, it just quietly holds your stuff. The amount it can holdis related to your guildlevel, how many comps you used to create it, whosecorpse it was and how many comps you 'feed' it. This version might require10 blood per item held (after all, swords are heavy). In any case, there isan upper bound on each valet's capacity. Multiple valets are permitted.If someone tries to steal from a valet, they get a (tough) angry spirit todeal with. I doubt that'll happen, but since the RoD is generously donatingthe use of a spirit to animate the corpse, it will look very harshly upon anecromancer attacking or otherwise betraying it.Good? Bad? Ugly?**It occurs to me that a useful feature would be a guild storage system.Instead of having a locker, we can have some other way to store stuff.I thought of 2 things: 1) buy a safe for some amount, and it can hold afixed number of items.
