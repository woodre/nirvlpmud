NEW HEALS

Listing of new heals available within qual'tor. Unless otherwise noted, they
are all available from Randals Shop (/newstuff/potionstore.c)

cheese2 has extra charges, and is available only on a monster (fog giant)
grapeshot2 has charges reduced, and is available only on a monster (ant)
chocolates are available in Chadndra's Shop (/newstuff/femstore.c)
