     Bidding

Unless things change drastically (this is Nirvana) this is how
the Mansion bidding is going to take place.

If you wish to place a bid, you come here and type:
bid # (# = the number of the lot you wish to bid upon)

Then you will get a message saying:
The current bid for lot # is XXX,XXX
Do you wish to bid upon this lot? (y/n)

If you wish to pass on this lot, the simply type n
If you wish to bid, then type y (go figure)

When you bid, you must have the coins already deposited.
No deposits will be taken the week of Sept 4th to Sept 11th.
After that time, additional deposits will be taken for mansion
improvements and such
