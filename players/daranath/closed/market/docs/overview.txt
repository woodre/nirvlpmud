We here at the Bone Market value rare and exotic corpses above
all else. To encourage you to bring them here, we give out 
credits based on how rare the kill was. These credits can be
used at the Bone Shop next door to purchase weapon, armor and
even several types of exotic heals.

In order to obtain credits, you must first Join the Bone
Marketeers. Membership will cost you 20,000 coins. This fee
not only gives access to the market, but also will get you a
magical badge that allows for communication with other members,
no matter what realm they are in.

What you do with your membership is up to you from this point.
The Bone Market can be a powerful ally here within the wilds
of Nirvana, use it wisely...
