Being a Bone Marketeer is high work and reward. 

By bringing corpses (preserved or not) to the Bone Market you can
exchange them for credits, which can be used to purcahse items,
including several heals at discounted prices. Xion will look
over corpses that you bring to him, decide on a value and give
you the appropriate amount of credit, which you then take to 
Dralgos in the Bone Shop (1 east of the market) and spend at
you leisure.

Several powers help you in your corpse collecting activities.
You can preserve a corpse for transport at a later time.
You can consider a monster to see how valuable a corpse they
     would leave behind.
You can also Identify items to help you during your battles.

In addition, the Market Badge helps keep track of stats that
are important to any risk taker, and lets you know where 
you stand in comparison to other Bone Marketeers.
