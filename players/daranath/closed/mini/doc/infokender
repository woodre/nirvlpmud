Kenders are the diminutive race straight from Dragonlance.  If you're a
Kender, sign up here.  If not, don't bother.  If you don't love them already,
you'll hate the mini guild.  For those of you that don't know, Kenders are
very innocent little people with no fear and overactive senses of imagination.
They carry all sorts of items in their kender bags, and always have a hoopak
handy.
