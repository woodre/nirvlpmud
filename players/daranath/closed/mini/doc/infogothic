The Gothics are new on the scene of Ryllian, but have adapted well to the city
of eternal night.  Gothics are often moody, depressed and have tendencies to
dress in exotic forms of black apparel.  They have no real powers (isn't that
depressing?), but often are very good dancers.  They can also be quite evil
when angered.
