item_long "A waterproof hiking GPS made my Garmin with a nylon wrist strap.  Only|4 inches by 2.5 inches it is small enough to fit comfortably on your|wrist, but yet big enough to see clearly.  The high-sensitivity GPS|receiver will keep working even in heavy cover or caynons.  Perfect|for avoiding Walker infested towns and keeping track of your way off|the main roads.  No survivor would want to be without this device."
