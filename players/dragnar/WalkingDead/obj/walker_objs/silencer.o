item_long "A black matte suppressor made for a Glock 9mm pistol to reduce the|noise of a round firing from the pistol to just a few decibles louder|than the hammer hitting the bullet.  The cylinder is 6 inches in|length with its diameter slightly bigger than the barrel of the|gun it will attach to, with small holes drilled into the outside.|This is an almost priceless item in the world of Walkers who are|drawn to loud noises."
