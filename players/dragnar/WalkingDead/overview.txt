Walking Dead Overview
-----------------------------------
Loosely based on the Walking Dead TV show.
  - Walkers roam the forest.
  - Walkers will join into larger mobs if they are in the same room.
    - When joined, 1 mob is destroyed and level of 2nd mob increased.
      - Increasing level increases stats, spell damage, etc.
    - Walkers range from level 20 to 26 depending on number of walkers in the mob.
    - Walkers are aggro
    - Walkers will follow a player slowly, they can easily be outrun, but dangerous for wimpy
    - Groan spell will call walkers in adjoining rooms
    - Corpses must be "searched" to find items, which can be sold in the survivors town
  - Players can see how badly the area is infested at the entrance.
  - Corpses in this area will of course re-animate into Walkers
    - Zombie corpses do not re-animate
  - When player dies in the area their information is forever saved in a .o file
    - Corpse will re-animate into the walker within 2 mins, including lost gear, coins
    - They have a random chance of being cloned as a walker at any point in the future.
  - Walkers are controlled by a daemon object so when max reached corpses will no 
    longer turn into zombies. Players cannot overrun the area.
     - Max is set to 21. A level 20 mob counts for 1, while a level 26 horde counts for 7.
       Ex: 21 level 20 mobs
       Ex: 2 level 26 mobs (horde), 1 level 25, 1 level 20
