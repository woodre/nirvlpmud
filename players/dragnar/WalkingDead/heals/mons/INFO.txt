Heals in this directory are found as treasure, not sold in a shop.

1. Heals have weight since they inherit from /obj/generic_heal
2. Removed heals from guard mobs.
3. Modified walker corpses to have random chance of getting heal
   instead of a walker obj. I substitute tier 2 items for advil,
   tier 3 for vicodin, and tier 4 for percocet.
   Tier 2 avg 2500 coins
   Tier 3 avg 5000 coins
   Tier 4 avg 10000 coins
   Chance of getting heal is !random(6)
   Only bigger walkers will have the higher tiers of items
4. Reduced the random charges
5. Modified aj.c to only get 1 heal and only has 1/3 chance of getting 1
6. Oakley only gets 1 heal, but left gear the same since his value can be
   as high as $30k
