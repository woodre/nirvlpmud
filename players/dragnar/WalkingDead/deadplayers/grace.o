description "studies you with a curious intensity, unmistakable intelligence burning in the depths of her wide, aquamarine eyes.  Her modest thigh- length tunic of dark purple silk with silver embroidery over her simply cut low-belted blue silk gown mark her both as a scholar and as a member of a high caste, as do her soft, ink-stained fingers that  have obviously never seen rough work.  Thick, shiny curls of honey- blonde frame her fair fine-boned face before tumbling carelessly down to her hips.  A rare, fleeting smile transforms her from lovely to breathtaking as she inclines her head toward you in acknowledgement, then turns her attention elsewhere. "
