description "has the high cheekbones, pale skin, and delicately pointed ears common to elven nobility.  His eyes are a blue so pale they're almost lavender, and his shoulder-length hair is almost perfectly white, as are his eyebrows. He wears a high-necked jacket, worked with silver, and left open to show the silken tunic underneath, with dark breeches and a pair of boots perfectly matched to the jacket.  He appears unarmed, but moves with perfect self-assurance, if not outright arrogance. "
