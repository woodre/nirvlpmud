You tell deathblow: what's up?
->> Deathblow tells you: was idle in the sandstorm the minute I came out I started
sacrificing blood this shouldnt be happening Ive played a
dervish now for 2-3 yrs and this is the first time this has
started happening since I hit level 19
Deathblow tells you: soon as I find another guild Im done with dervish and as
soon as I find another mud where I can get comfortable
playin Im done with this one because it seems I can do
nothing right and Im always the one getting punished if I
step outta line yet let someone else step out of line and
there arent any consequences so fuck you fuck the dervish
and fuck nirvana because its not worth the frustration
anymore and people wonder why we have very few NEW people
this place has become a place of bullies hanging out
Deathblow ( player 13 ) has left the game.
