SHARDAK
	The guild hall is protected by a level 16 monster.  Breaking
	in to the guild is therefore relatively easy, and since most
	of the guild is pk/fight_area, other guilds have besieged the
	guild.
	In most of the guild rooms, members can summon shardak to aid
	them in combat against other players. Shardak is a high level
	monster, but has been `killed' on several occassions. For some
	guilds it is easier than for others..
	Shardak can return from death/banishment by the guild members
	sending sps. 1000 sps is need to break the banishment.
	Recently, when the guild took a severe drop in members, Shardak
	has begun to prowl the guild and attack intruders. It is still
	possible to go undetected though.

MISC
	Weapon repair in guild, demon blade, ring of murder,
	practice dummy, entrance to sparring arena, borrowing money.
	Will elaborate..

NICHES
	These are guild lockers and the number of items that can be
	saved is derived from class and guild level.
