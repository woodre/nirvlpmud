* Bidding starts April 4th and closes April 14th at midnight.
* Only players who do not currently own land will be able to bid.
* The top three valid bids will win the opportunity to buy one
    of the new housing lots in the Walking Dead area.
* Your bid wins you the chance to select the location of your
    house and the size of the lot desired. The highest bidder
    will get first choice, and so on.
* The bid amount is only for the chance to buy the house. The
    bid will NOT be placed toward the cost of the house itself.
    Any costs to purchase the lot and develop the house will
    be in ADDITION to the amount of your auction bid.
* Lots purchased by the winning bidders are subject to size
    restriction based upon the purchaser's available funds and
    existing level requirements.
* Minimum bid is 100,000 gold coins.
* The lots will cost 150,000 gold coins. House cost will depend
    on the size of the house. View the help files in the Realty
    office.
* You must have the gold in your bank account to cover the bid.
* Gold will be removed from your bank account at the time of the bid.
* Players that do not have a winning bid will be able to reclaim their
    bids once the bidding has closed. They will have 1 week to reclaim 
    their gold.
* Players that have a winning bid must log in within 24 hours to pick
    out their lot location and purchase the land or their bid will be 
    forfeited. In that event, the next highest bidder will be notified
    by mudmail and will have 24 hours to choose their lot or retract
    their bid by reclaiming their gold.
