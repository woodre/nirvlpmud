  - Just a suggestion, add an action to the room that adds a message to the room about the automatic doors
    when the player leaves to the n or s. ASCII would be cool
  - Guards are pretty spammy when both are in the room
  - Guards not meant to prevent player from entering?

Mobs
-------
a_carmack.c - Good
t_hall.c
  - Not sure I understand the point of the bitch_slapped function being called from
    the spell. It looks like the room will get two messages for the spell, and
    the spell has an 80% fire rate. I'd suggest lowering the % and increasing the
    damage a bit, then doing the second message from the function only when the
    damage is close to the max amount.
guard.c - Good
s_petersen.c - Good
a_mcgee.c - Good 
keen.c 
  - Where is the GB packers helmet for armor?!
  - I think you should drop the % of spells firing and increase damage.
  - He needs 1 more special ability for this level
j_carmack.c - Good
romero.c - Good
  - Had issue with catch_tell with the dark order guild obj on me
  - Suggestion, add to the message something about John empowering his daikatana when switching to crit.
romero_proud.c 
  - Again I think you should drop the % of spells firing and increase damage.
    This keeps the fight a bit less predictable even though multi cast is on
  - He needs 1 more special ability for this level
romero_crit.c
  - Same theme for spells, lower % and increase dam. Spells should be in the
    60+ range for a mob this level, even with multicast on. If you wanted you
    could remove spells or reduce spell dam while shield is active?
  - Coin limit for level 28 is 23k, but he clearly meets requirements for level 29
    so you can bump level to 29 to increase max of 30k coins
  - Emp daikatana is valued at 23k which must be included in the mobs value. However
    the weapon only heals 150, and doesn't store, so I think you could drop the
    value of this wep to 5k which would require lowering gold a bit. You can
    either increase heal amount to make the weapon more valuable and lower coins,
    or keep wep as is, lower value of wep, and only lower coins a bit to stay under
    30k.
fanboy.c - Good

  
Note: 3500 coins can be 2000 + random(3000) but nice when they are not always max

Items
-----------
All good, only comments on daikatana value noted under romero_crit.c

General Feedback
-----------------
  - Very nice job Karash
    - Headers done, comments added, easy to read code, nice overview
    - Rooms well done with descriptions and items, grammar (coming from me take that for whatever it is worth)
    - Well done theme with nice humor adding to it, setup will for future areas
    - Obvious that you took the time to understand the base objects like monster.c and use the
      functions available from those objects.
    - Nice that your mobs don't all have max coins and gear isn't all 100% pushing limits, while your
      bigger mobs are still interesting and different from anything else.
    - Tied up a lot of lose ends I would not expect from a wizards first area, good example is resetting
      John romero during room reset but still knowing to ensure he wasn't engaged in combat.
