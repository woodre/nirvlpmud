Weapons
-------------------------
axe_new.c 
  -OK, weapon_hit to clone the poison obj would be cool, although it would have to be rare.
hammer.c 
  -Change non-fatal hit to 70-80 dmg.  Should be 2 handed weapon with weight of 4?
holy_mace_new.c
  -OK
invis_sword.c
  -OK
poison_dagger_new.c
  -OK
  
Armor
--------------------------
earcuffs_new.c
  -OK
shield_magresist_new.c
  -change resistances to 2. An armor special could temporarily raise them to 15
shield_natresist_new.c
  -same as magic shield.
  
Misc
--------------------------
black_opal.c
  -OK
courage_obj_new.c
  -OK
courage_wand_new.c
  - 3-5 charges or randomize 10 charges. Can reduce heal to 10% of you want. Increase value per charge accordingly. Or change mob
    mobs to load only once per boot.
frenzy_obj_new.c
  - Same as courage wand. 40% dmg penalty seems high, can reduce if desired.
holy_symbol_new.c
  -OK
mirror_new.c
  -OK
moonstone.c
  -OK
nomelee_obj_new.c
  -OK
onyx.c
  -OK
paralyze_obj_new.c
  -OK
parry_obj_new.c
  -OK
poison_obj_new.c
  -OK, add room message?
stun_obj_new.c
  -OK
topaz.c
  -OK
  
Rooms
-----------------------
  -OK since just fixing typos etc.
  
Mons
-----------------------
basilisk.c
  -Level 25 requires 2 specials, paralyze is 1, needs another. Best to list these in the header.
  -Suggestion, poison?
  -Max coins for level 25 is 11,000, coins are slightly over currently
captain2_new.c
  -I'll update the value of the cleaver when we move everything over.
captain.c
  -Optional: Not sure why we need 2 copies of the same mob? Understand that 1 is the real one and the other is the mirror.
   I would think the room could clone 3 of the same file and set the flags to know which is which. A lot of the code
   is duplicated in the files. If you want to have 2 files to make it cleaner maybe you should inherit from the other so
   all of the code can be in a single file. Just yell if you need help with this, should not be a lot of rework, let me
   know if I am wrong.
cyclo.c
  -OK
hook_horror.c
  -OK, can up coins if we reduce the armor value which is nothing special
imp_master.c
  -OK, why not use the poison_obj here? In fact adding suggestion to the axe to call this obj as well.
kargile.c
  -Level 25 requires 2 specials, stun is 1, needs 1 more.
  -Second special idea - have him use the hammers throw command when the player gets below 100 hps! Could manually set
    the required variables in the weapon so it would work, would be very cool effect.
ltng_elemental_new.c
  -OK
master_cleric.c
   -OK
  -Ignoring specials for the masters, since they force you to fight more than 1 and coordinate efforts, and each
   has at least 1 special attack.
master_fighter.c
   -OK
master_mage.c
  -OK
red_dragon.c
  -OK
master_thief.c
  -OK
  
Suggestions
-----------------
I continue to be very impressed with your code for the amount of experience that you have.  You make it very easy
on me to do your approvals. Your unique mobs/objects really add something to the game, and you really push the
boundaries of what you've done before. I'd say one thing to try and focus on is creating functions when
you have similar code in multiple places. For example in the cleric where he heals the other masters, you have
a function for each one. This could be a function that maybe you pass the object to to heal it. The code in your
masters heartbeat, although I did not look closely, I think there are most likely places there that could be combined.
Or maybe you should even have a master mob that inherits from monster.c, and each master type inherits from your master
npc. Same with the captain, the mirror and the real mob are essentially the same, and I think they could be combined.
This are obviously not required for approval, but things to look for as you go on to the next project.
Again, a great job, I am especially excited to try out the dragon, he is very unique (masters a close second).
Congrats
