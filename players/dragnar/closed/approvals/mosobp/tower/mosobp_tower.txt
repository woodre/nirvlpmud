ROOMS
	* I didn't find any real issues with the rooms, but I have suggestions for future areas:
		o Room descriptions should be a bit more detailed.
		o Items in the room as well could use more flushing out.
		o It would be good to have more interaction with your rooms. If a player spends time 
      exploring and never finds anything interesting with the items in your rooms it won't 
      encourage exploring. Hidden room exits, hidden items needed for other rooms etc. make 
      it more interesting for the player.
OBJ
	* daura.c
		o Fix path in the header
		o I think a mage bonus should be added to match the original aura, if you need help 
      just let me know.
	* dki, gloves, pants, sarmor, sboots are all OK.
NPC
	* chiaotzu.c
		o Level 15 but with 500 hps, max gold for level 15 is 1000. Either raise level to 17 
      and raise wc/ac to 24/14, or lower gold.
		o Need to update header information.
	* garlicjr.c
		o Fix long, incomplete sentence: After escaping from the dead zone.
		o Looks similar to piccolo, needs the same changes we made to piccolo by removing 
      HB and adding spell to handle heals & room damage.
		o If you leave HB (not my first choice), debug messages need to be removed.
		o Total loot needs to be a max of 11,000 including gear.
	* korrin.c
		o Room has sign that describes buying sensu beans, but I don't see an action in the 
      room or the mob to buy the beans?
	* mustard.c
		o Coins are high for level 17, lower total value to 2100 including gloves (can lower 
      hps if desired), or change to level 20, increase wc/ac to 30/17. Spell damage is 
      already high enough for level 20.
	* nappa.c
		o  set_multi_cast(1) doesn't do anything since he only has 1 spell. 
		o Lower gold to max of 2750. 2750 + 1250 + 1000 for armor = 5000
	* piccolo.c
		o Gold is at max, needs to be lowered to account for armor.
		o Which version do you plan to use, the one I helped you with? If so the message 
      needs to be updated in heal_check function.
		o Remove the commented out HB.
		o I'm never fighting this mob :)
	* raditz.c
		o Level 15 max is 1000, armor is worth 1250 + 1000. Need to increase to level 17 stats.
	* salt.c
		o Should be level 20
	* tien.c
		o set_multi_cast(3); should be set_multi_cast(1); It is either on or off.
		o Change gold to 4500 + r(1000)
	* vinegar.c
		o Ensure value of gear + gold does not exceed 8000
	* yamcha.c
		o OK
