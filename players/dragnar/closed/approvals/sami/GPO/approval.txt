NPC
-----------------------
bvampboss.c
  - set_multi_cast should be either 0 or 1, 5 is the same as 1
  - Why the set_hp_bonus of 650? It is inflating his exp worth
  - Need to check the value of the grace and cube. Max coins for level 22 is total of 7k. You have 
    13,500 avg coins plus 7k weapon and 2 non-tox heals.
  - What is the special advantage?
    - obj/grace (7200)
    - closed/cube x2 
    - 13500 coins
bvamp.c
  - Max value for level 21 is 6k. Mob has 9500 avg plus
  - won't require it, but I'd prefer to see the updated add_spell functionality
    You cannot have more than 1 add_spell_dam, the 2nd call just overrides the
    first, same with set_spell_mess. This vamp will only fire the 2nd spell. That
    is why add_spell preferred. Also, you have tpn in the string of the
    message, it will never pull in the players name.
      - obj/vmace (1200)
      - 9500 coins
lvampboss.c
  - set_hp_bonus ? same as bvampboss
  - Long has a comment about a ring like mikal, but he doesn't have a ring?
  - "other|physical" is wrong, should just be physical. But that is the default so if you pass in 0
    it will default to physical.
  - Max value for level 20 is 5k. Gear as stated is over 20k plus nontox heals.
    - obj/necklace (5000)
    - obj/vsword (7200)
    - obj/pants (10000)
    - closed/cube x2
lvampire.c
  - Same comments about spells as bvamp.c
    - 3000 coins ok for lev 19
mikal.c
  - set_hp_bonus ?
  - set_multi_cast
  - Value is high with gear + nontox heals
    - obj/dring (3000)
    - obj/vmace (1200)
    - closed/cube x2
mikal2.c
  - not used, remove?
mvampboss.c
  - set_hp_bonus ?
  - set_multi_cast 
    - obj/pants (10000)
    - closed/cube x2
mvampire.c
  - set_multi_cast
  - Max value for level 21 is 6k
    - 7750 coins
overall
  - For each mob over level 20 please have a comment at the top of the file that specifically
    lists the "special" advantage requirements in the build rules for monsters.
  - Not sure what to do with the cubes. Snow demons are level 22 with high wc and only give 1 ice sphere.
    And ice spheres have a drawback of melting. You need to work on the value of your mobs, rethink
    it and let me know.
  - Your boss mobs should have more unique long descriptions, they each have
    pretty much the same description.
  - Some of the formatting is all over the place. Try to indent evenly, if you are having issues with
    FTP let me know.

    - 20% 3.5 hps
necklace.c
  - Max 2% reduction in dark/evil damage

    - -5% other|light
pants.c
  - Per Fred, +5 to both BF stats would be the max for non main armor
  - Over 40% chance to heal 5 sps with max luck. Need to fix the fire mechanism 
    for this bonus.
vmace.c
  - Max return for weapon_hit of 3 unless you add restrictions based on previous comments.
    - wc 15 + 3 other|evil
    - 20% chance of return 5
vsword.c
  - Avg wc of 25 is too high, lower % of special (see previous comments)
    - wc 20 + 3
    - 40% chance of return 5
Zan.c
  - Not used, remove?
overall
  - I like you use of luck stat in the pants, I'd like to see more variety in
    the gear bonuses and the requirements for them to fire, like use of stats or
    prestige level or other unique things.
  - I'd like to see weps and armor in their own dirs, but won't require you
    update it now. If not then remove wep/armor dirs.
    
ROOMS
-----------------------
ldeck5.c
  - add_action search added but function not defined. Search in room gives error.
  - Hint in room long says covered up door. However the item is "doors". You can have
    a item for door and doors by using the & notation. You don't want a better hint for going
    west?
    "lot", "A Parking Lot",
    "parking lot", "&lot&",
labpath3.c
  - search broken like ldeck5
abarracks7.c
  - 3 ways to go n. Search debris only works once, but pass and north always work, was
    that what was intended?
medlab4, medlab5, medlab6.c
  - newline messed up at the end of the room long.
medlab4.c
  - Room long map doesn't match exists
labhall.c
  - empty file, remove?
overall
  - Too many mobs in the area, try to randomize it? I'd suggest 30 / 20 / 12
  - Why using jareel's define.h? Dependencies like this causes maintenance issues
  - Avoid putting in the long the item descriptions ex: labpath3 the shelves description
    is in the long as well as the shelves item.
