The inspiration for the layout of these rooms comes from 
Maledicta's cont area. I always loved what he did there both
as a player and a wizard.

These rooms are generated using the ss_make_area command from
my wiztool. This function reads the map in this directory and
creates all of the room files. The long is set using a daemon
object that also reads the map.

The map daemon reads the map file, converts it to 2d array, and
uses the name of the room to identify the room in the map. The
rooms are named from the ss_make_area command based on row and
column locations. The map daemon converts the room the user is 
in to an X. The daemon then adds colors to the map based on the 
map key.

Please don't mess with these rooms unless you understand how
they work. The rooms can be regenerated but some rooms are modifed
after they are created that have special items in them.

Required Files in this dir for the mapDM to work properly:
  o map.txt   - Non color version of the map
  o map_key.o - List of keys and their colors

Required Files for the ss_make_area command to work:
  o rstart    - Template for the room files
  o map.txt   - Non color version of the map
  o map_key.o - List of keys and their colors
