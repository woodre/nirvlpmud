 I don't know much, but I will tell what I can...
Once when i was first summoned to this world, I ran into
a man in the town to the east.  He told me that there is a portal
that connects to the past, before the destruction of this world.
A key is needed to open the portal, perhaps the man in town
could tell you where to find it?
