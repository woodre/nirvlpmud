The guild theme is based on the Star Wars Jedi.  My original idea for the guild
was born from the LucasArts PC game "Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight".  Ideas also 
came from the movies, and some from the role-playing games.

A player joins the guild only when a Jedi Master seeks them out as an
apprentice.  A master can only have one apprentice at a time.  Training for the
apprentice is done through Jedi Masters, both players and NPC's.  Players can
advance the player's guild level, and the NPC's are used to train in specific
skills.  The darkside powers are damage based, and the lightside is more
defense oriented.  The lightside has to be weary of using darkside spells,
attacking kids/pets/lightside Jedi, or they will fall to the darkside.
