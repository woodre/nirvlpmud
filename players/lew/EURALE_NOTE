   I worked on the Keivjam quest to change it so the cheat sheets do not
reflect accurate solutions any longer.  I moved the meal ticket that was
located in ~/entrance to ~/commons and replaced it with an ID card.  The ID
card will still get you through ~/res_hall but not through the cafeteria to
the basement where Roomstalker is.  You'll now need the meal card to get
throuugh the cafeteria.  I changed the ~/easthall/basement so that only one
student is there and he must be killed to bring in the correct one with the
terminal to get into the area with Keivjam.  Lastly, I made access to the
summoning square ~/elof/vir_wrld13.c only two directions instead of the original
four.  The quest remains basically the same... I just added some twists.
