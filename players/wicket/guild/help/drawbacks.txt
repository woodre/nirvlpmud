		Drawbacks of the Elements
		
	 1. No Game armor will be allowed to be
	   worn. (There is only one exception 
	   though if you are wise to find this
	   information then very good. So suggestion
	   on reading ALL help files would be very
	   wise.)
		    
         2. No Ingame weapons will be able to be
           used as well. You will be able to call
           forth from the four elements a staff and
           this will be your weapon. 
		      
	 3. Your Stamina and your strength stats will
	   not be allowed to rise past 20. This is a 
	   guild of casting and power of the elements
	   your mind, magic and soul is your power.
		    
         4. No pets will be able to be used other
           than ones that can be summoned from the
           powers of the anicent elements.
