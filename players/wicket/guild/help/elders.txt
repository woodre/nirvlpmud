		Elders of the Elements
		
	 1. These are a group of four maxed
	   people within the guild. They are
	   chosen by the guild wizard. The
	   guild wizard will have chosen due
	   to they knowledge and leadership
	   skills that this person has.
         
	 2. NO ONE is to show any disrespect
	   to an Elder of the Guild Wizard.
	   They are of high rank and standings
	   in the guild and are there for a 
	   reason. If you have questionable
	   reasons of thoughts of disagreement.
	   then follow it up with the guild 
	   wizard and the name of the elder.
	 
	 3. Below The Guild Wizard Elders are
	   the law and ranked right under the
	   guild wizard. They have the choice
	   of recruiting as well as enforcing
	   the laws and standards of this guild.
	   
	   If at all Anything comes up please
	   mudmail me and things will be handled
	   with due to actions and what has been
	   done to bring the issue to me.
	      Thanks,
	        ~Wicket
