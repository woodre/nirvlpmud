			As a potential recruit for the Elementalists,
			you must obtain an item for each of the Elemental
			Masters. Once you have completed their tasks, you
			may go to Khnum and 'complete' the process and
			become a full Elementalist.
			
			As a recruit, the following commands are available
			to you:
				
			'teleport' to the guild hall.
			
			'check' to see which tasks you still have.
			
			'review' each task to see what must be done.
			
			'i_am_no_elementalist' to give up your quest
						for Elemental power.
			
			Any questions, please ask the recruiting Elementalist.
