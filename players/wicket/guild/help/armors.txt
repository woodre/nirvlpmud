	           Elementalist Armors
		
				
		The nature of this guild
		will not allow you to wear
		armors crafted and formed
		by someone else. You MUST
		forge your own armors by
		your own hand to protect
		yourself. The divine 
		assistance of the four 
		Guardians of each element
		have given you their powers
		to be able to shape armors.
		This is done through the
		power of the elements at a 
		cost. (elehelp kataprep)...
		All though it is rumored 
		that in legend if one is to
		slay the ancient elements in
		a test of might, endurance, 
		and fortitude you might be
		able to wear an piece of the
		ancient armor from that test.
