               History of the Elementalists
		
				
 Centuries ago, this world was the Utopia of its time. People were able
to roam freely without fear of being kidnapped, controlled, or worse,
killed. Bards lined the streets, playing music, dancing, and drinking
happily. Members of the Knights Templar would join in on the
celebrations. One night, a dark, fog-like mist overtook the world. Wild,
mysterious creatures appeared from the mist and began to wreak havoc!
The creatures began to attack the citizens of the world. They would
chomp down on their throats and rip out their vocal cords. Some of the
creatures would just infect their victims with a new disease. The
disease would kill the victim and then they would be reborn as a
pale, blood-sucking demon. Thus, the Vampires were born. Other
creatures evolved into human forms and began experimenting on more
citizens. Body parts were removed from citizens and replaced with
cybernetic implants. Thus, the Cyberninjas were born. Dark magic was
introduced to the world and the chaos began.

 An Ancient being who had been searching for intelligent life on other
planets finally arrived here. He watched as the creatures continued
their destruction and mass genocide of this worlds people. Anger grew
within him as he watched the people of this world suffer. Finally,
he could not contain it anymore and he leapt in to defend the world.
The Ancient being began slaughtering the creatures. Blood was
splattered along the sidewalks and buildings. Guts littered the streets.
The creatures eventually started to retreat back into the mist instead
of facing the fate that they would soon meet. The citizens rejoiced
at their new hero who fought off the mist!

 The Ancient being introduced himself as Khnum. Khnum explained that
he was searching for intelligent life on other planets in order to
research a cure for a disease that is killing off the people of his
planet. After searching for a couple of days in this world, he
determined that no one would be able to help him. The citizens
pled for him to stay and to help protect them in case the mist
came back for revenge. Khnum gave this some thought and decided
that he would find four worthy people that would help defend the
world. And so his search began......
