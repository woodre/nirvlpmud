in set_long it should say:
"He has been around for ages and is very knowledgeable"
"old, dusty, woven, red robe"

Since he is a level 27 mob, he has to have several powerful
spells (which he has 2.) Make one more spell.

He also has to have three "special" advantages.

1) He stops movement

2) None

3) None

You need to come up with 2 other special advantages. I
would suggest Gnar's idea of summoning a turtle that is
alive to come assist him. Then an additional one.

Weapon class should be no higher than 48
Armor class should be no higher than 25
Health should be no higher than 1500
Coins should be no higher than 17500

The only rule that Splinter violates as of right now
is the weapon class of 50 which is 2 over. Fix that.

load_chat fixes:
First one: Put a period after Chi. Lowercase "Clear"
Second one is fine
Third one: Lowercase "Must"
Fourth one: Lowercase "way", "master". Put a comma after "body"

add_spell changes:

cane_whack:
Splinter shakes his head shakes his head? Remove one set of "shakes his head"

hip_thow:
Put a period after shoulders not a comma.
