Wren 2003 (TM)

This guild idea is drawn heavily from Palladium Games "Rifts" system. Coalition,
dog pack, and many other ideas are specifically drawn from them. Skills and 
abilities and this particular group are mine. For priliminary basis check out
Rifts:Lone Star by Palladium Books.

I think guilds need history. If you don't give players an example of expected
behavior its hard to get them to do as you'd like. 


History for new guild.

                    Feral Brigade or (Feral Commandos) *not sure which yet*

Former Coalition animal squad created in Lone Star Complex. Got distracted in a combat zone and found a mobile infantry division flaming a mutant village. The armor division was not aware of the animal squad being deployed in the area and fired on their position forcing them to flee. The commander of the armor misreported the animals as defectors to cover his error. The leader of the animal pack, Master Sergeant Victor the Wolfhound took his squad into hiding intending on returning to the fold once the heat had passed. While concealed they intercepted radio messages from headquarters directing assault forces to exterminate them as enemies of the Coalition. They also recieved a mysterious encoded transmission from deaper afield. 

They investigated it origin and found it was a pair of squads sent out to find the rogues under the comand of Victor's son Aaron. They met under a flag of truce and it was laid out swiftly how the armor commander had played up the situation to further glorify his part in the recent 'successful' mission. The commanding officer of the animal forces back at base had recognized the deception and uncharacteristically took steps to protect his former charges. He sent the plans for the next military push and instructions on where to go for further assistance. The retrieval squads had been sent out with full gear and additional munitions to resupply the rogues. 

The three squads joined togethor and set forth to dodge their former allies and make a new beginning. They met up with the mercenary company as instructed and found serveral other 'ferals' who had found relative safety there. Provided with some disguises and no further plans of their own, they signed on with the company. Though slandered they intended to prove their worth. As highly trained soldiers they racked up scores of successful ops and quickly proved to be one fo the most profitable units in the mercs.

So it was this efficiency that led to them being hired as front runners on a big contract to assist in the forming of a trade route through a Rift. A Shifter contacted the mercenaries for a team to explore a stable Rift site. Normally the animal mutants are loath to deal with mystics or magics but Victor saw an opportunity to bring his 'ferals' to a frontier world to set up a base of operations well outside Coalition influence. This brough them to the rough edges of Nirvana. A rather primitive society which should provide plenty of employment opportunities as well as chances to hone skills. They have also found a great deal of supernatural evil that they intend to deal with for their own long term protection.

This is the backstory for the Ferals. They have a strong desire to prove their value to the world and a lot of training to achieve that end. They have an inherit dislike of magic and a violent loathing of supernatural evils. Trust is something difficult to earn but solidly backed once it is held. Their natural animal senses are augmented by genetic manipulation and psionic abilities.
