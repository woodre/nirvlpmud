tmp_text "               [A Test Poem]It is not fair...To only be a test poem.To know, that one dayI will be gone.They needed me nowThey said.But what is need?Yet just another word...for a lie.I suppose,this is how it must beto be here one momentand gone the next.Just remember...We all must go some day.and you my friendare next.                   - Anonymous**Your eyes light afire as they gaze into mine.As I hold you tight, our love is frozen in time.You looked at me and I gave you my heart.I knew we'd be together from the very start.We'll always be together, I have no doubt.The love you show has givenme something to think about.The touch of your kiss sends a shive down my spine.The moment our eyes met, I knew you'd be mine.I think of holding you, as you do of holding me.The love we have is how love is meant to be.The way you make me feel, I can't live without.Spending the rest of my life with you is all I think about.I dream of holding you at night, time and time again.That moment we met, I knew your heart I had to win.This bond we have between us is one of a kind.Since I've had you in my life, I've had peace of mind.The tender love I share with you, can reach any amount.Your gorgeous smile and sparkling eyes, I cant stop thinking about.The passion and tenderness you possess drives me crazy.Your faith and dedication does nothing but amaze me.Our commitment for each other will always remain true.For all of eternity, you can be sure that I love you.How we found each others love, I'll never figure it out.One thing for sure, my dreams of loving you is something to think about.**Oh!  The mighty warrior, with his well-used blade,long are the nights he keeps doom away.But lest ye forget, when you call for his aid,his is the blade of the despot`s sway.And clerics have a soothing touch.Healing dire wounds for members of the fold.But if you`re of a different mind, it doesn`t mean muchfor the Gods, it seems, require their gold.Mages, studying in their lonely towers of stone,can change the world with but a thought.But be wary of those who amass power alone;their harts are cold, tied tightly in an icy knot.Only the Bard, with keen rapier, tongue, and eyebrings smiles and hope to all under Soli`s sky.-Raphael**Upon nimble, skillful wingsMystically soaring overheadLooping, dodging; aerial acrobatsObserving in wondermentStranded on the groundYou yearn to take wingGliding high above the cloudsWith magnificent creaturesYou are truely content aloftSurely that is real freedom-BreezyApril, 1998**As I stand at the top of the world,I look down, and see people, like antsmarching on the ground below.Though I have struggled,I have managed to overcomethe troubles of the world. I feel a deep sense of satisfactionknowing that I alone have managedto make it this far.Overcoming obstacles is a part of life,one that we use to make us stronger.Has anyone else ever made it this far?Would they come back down to let others know?So after standing at the summitand rejoicing in the sunlight, I have decided to go back.I must tell others what I have seenFor what good is it to be at the top of the worldwithout someone to share the view with?-Dagger**Wanting to escape from the darkness into the lightWanting to stop wandering, searching for a place to call homeWant to love with a heart broken and tornWanting to find the passion in life when the fires burnt outWanting to find the one who truely understands youWanting a cure for all the pain and confusionWanting someone to hold you and say it's gonna be ok Wanting to believe today is just one day and tomorrow will be betterWanting to believe life goes on**He's the manSaber, Bardic OneWe miss himWe go onWe are bards againWe sing songsRememberKeep him in your heartRemember**The music of the Heart,The type that sooths the savage beast.A time of change, People changing,Which brings out a new era of hope.The rising of the sun,Bringing forth a new day.The patterns of the weather changing,The beginning of Life.        -Danimal**Some days i walk down the street.Bearing obstacles that block my way.In a light in which is too dim to see.Is my life that seems to be.As my light begins to shine, i sing and dance,And guide one eye to eye.Making foes become friends, and there anger is sure to end.Hopefully.I write of things soon to endSoon those things, will surely blend.**There was a man unskilled with sword.He had no skill at arms.He was not very big or strong.He could not work a farm.He was not rich and powerful.A plain and simple man.He had a skill and it showed whenA harp was in his hands.And when he played upon that harp,Such wondrous music came.It could make bold a coward's heart.Or bring the proud to shame.It could stir the deepest heart.Bring joy or sadness too.But like his song, he is now gone.His kind are far too few.**Here I am new in the world, not sure what will come.Why am I here, thats all I want to know.As I walk down the streets of life pondering my mission, as I watch life fill out their mission.I see many things yet dont know my way, always wandering, pondering, what will I be?When all hope, is about to run out.I meet a woman, who turns my life around.Everything about her, makes my heart go pound.As our lips meet, the world spins around.A few years into the future, is all it will take.As she labors hard and births our child, I get a glimps of what I was searching for.I look down at the small form of life, then I look at my wife.As I gaze into her eyes as I could not have belived, but at long last I have found my destinee.**Sollalon Spring's melody, renewal song,My memory of friends and places Since faded into mist,Remain with me, and always recallAffection lost, but well remembered.**I want to crawl threw your tides baby,feel your penetrating stare,If those lips, of those supple lips, I could taste...I would forever be guilty of countless crimes,I pledge devotion to your great, dogmatic whispers.**I was lost, and I didn't even know it.I was anxious, but didn't care to show it.I was wondering down the road, where I've gone, and where I'll beAnd was wondering if the plans that I had chosen were for me.And thatIs when I saw HerThere she was, dressed in blue,And I never thought I'd seen anything as beautiful as you.I picked you up; I held you close;I sought to know you well.And I know you've in my heart a special place to dwell.**Waiting and WatchingHere I stand, waiting for youYou know not why, nor who I amBut still I wait, knowing that you'll come to meCome back to meSeek me out as you once didThere you go, walking awayYou know your path, but not my wayBut still I wait, and wait I do,Knowing that your return is imminent.And when you return I'll place a ring upon your fingerAnd purple robes upon your back.We'll kill the fatted calf, and drink the richest wineThankful that you have returned.Thankful that you have retentered the brotherhood.The sisterhood.The family of one who is watching and waiting for others to do the same.**people say it is blind,yet it knows many people.when it comes you will know,no one can explain it they just know it exist.     ----- Love -----**Like the cool waves of desireThe serenity of the oceanThe lull of the moonThe warmth of an embraceAll dormant in HerShe is the root, the causePower hidden in a woman's eyesAll the world is capturedIn her net and in her armsAnd angels sing of her beautyThe undines glory in her loveTill the sun risesThe Fire is born anewWoman recedes to the nightShe waits for the returnHer power found in theArms of a man, not over himThrough him, his intensityMagnified through HerThe Goddess inside each womanGlroies in the essence ofThe elements, Nature givenForm on the Planes andMan seeks to control and masterThe Goddess like a tideWarm and flowing, fluid inHer form, given to her ownIntensity that we ignorePleasure, a contraction ofThe physical, and a releaseTension builds through HisAgents and they seek toExpel the darkness theyDevelop... They look to HerChildren to grant them peace.**A glance of Light,The Beams of the sundancing on the waterThe Souls Floating along, along their next steptheir next step of lifeFlowing quietly, Flowing calmPeace and Restit comes to Us allDeath is only another journeyjust more to seekOne more life to fulfillOne more dream**Love is the way to a person's heart.Love is the way to a person's soul.Love is the way to a fulfilled life.Love shows one how to care.Love shows one how to learn.Love shows one how to grow within themselves.Some say that love is blind.Some say that love is illfated.Some say that love is only for the weak.All in all Love is just love.All in all love finds everyone at sometime.All in all love is caring, feeling, and sharing.**To love without endis a love so purenever to endSo precious and sweetlike a childs first treat.the feeling so greatso undescribable....but yet soundeniable.to fall so helplesslyand without haste.is a love so pure a love never to end.**These adventure can be dangerous and fun while everything else just floats by i wish i could see that sparkle in your eye when i left to get to war and stay by your side also to see your face day and night i will always be by your side foreverI wish you could be here by my side here every minute with me while i cry i want you to be here so i don't die and have a reson to fight for and that would be you and i will love you forever**Pulled ever deeper by an undertowTo see what I could findMt angel skin is breaking looseI gotta free my mindStripped of all but what's insideFeels as though I should have diedMy angel skin is breaking looseIn the tears that you have criedAnd I start to wonder whyAnd yes and yes I wonder whyas she screams at the open skyAnd yes and yes I wonder whyAnd I start to wonder whyAnd yes and yes I wonder whyas she screams at the open skyAnd yes and yes I wonder whyOne lives...One dies...One screms...The other cries...Ever deeper but I still goFeels as though I should have knownMy angel skin is breaking looseIn the lives that you have sownAnd I start to wonder whyAnd yes and yes I wonder whyAs she screams at the open skyYES oh YES I wonder WHY...**All the furstrations of life,All your love all your fears,You must use them all, to live all your years.When you life all your years,Times seem like a blur,But you rmemeber.You remember the extremes,The goodtimes, the bad,But it's the times in between that are the toughest to grab.To grab them you must dig,Dig deep in your life, and find the small piece of life,The in between piece of life.In the between of life you'll find the little things,The things that make us who we are,The things that make us who we want to be.The things that dreams are made of,And dreameers are the things that make our world a better place,A better place for you and me.For you and me are the ones that make a difference,The average people,The between people.**Another tear.Another day.Another friend gone, wrenching away a proverbial piece of my dying heart.Take the pain, bury it deep inside. Keep digging the hole, dig until my muscles scream with pain,aching, burning.God, I wish the pain were real then it could be seen, touched, healed. Keep digging, keep pressing on.Dig up memories past. What I had thought was true love, but what turned out to be fickle fate just playing a prank.Adding even more to the torture known as life. Keep going, on and on, toss the memory of my family, all killed on a hellish night,lost to the bullet of reality, damn that bites. Wipe away the tears, and hug the blanket closer, wishing it would all just go away. Curl up into a ball, try to will it gone. Start dealing with it all at long last. Cut out the lies, hack through the hurt, slice through the skin. See the blood, crimson and hot, potent with ghosts and dreams. Look up to the skies, up to whoever listens, and smile softly, tears making silver threads down my cheeks and whisper softly, in a broken voice. I have made the pain real. Now, I can begin to heal at last. **Tattered and Torn despair is born in the darkened soul of what was once a man.Trying to find lifes plan now unable to stand finding the knife in my hand.Times stands still nothing i feel no emotions I conceal what is real nothing ?Nothing i feel but sharpend stell pressed in to flesh only to provide eternal rest.Deaths guest at the banquet of lost souls.My lifes storie told as i watch and listen waiting to awake from this nightmare that will not end as it begins again.Haunted by my own sin in the end not even a friend could save my soul.Tattered and Torn forever unwhole.ByRavennight11/7/01**When first in the dunes of sand,I glimpsed your beauty and grace,My thoughts were no longer upon the land,But on your angelic face.You wrenched my heart,Your beauty an insane torment.Your side i never wished to depart,You are my heart's contentment.I suffer both day and night,The gap in my heart yawns wide,But to the hope of seeing you i hold tight,That forever yours i shall abide.I plight troth, my love i sing,With all my heart, I hope to wear your wedding ring.**I was but a child when you came into my life.You were in desperate need of a home and I wasin desperate need of a friend.I remember those long summer days.I remember the games that we played.I remember the races we ran and the luches we shared.I remember the storms that we watched and the naps that we took.Even as we both got older, things didn't change.You were always there for me, a silent friend thathad no words, who had no opinions, and passed no judgment.You only listened and provided quiet comfort.Your spirit and energy was what I most admired.Even as the years went by you were always young at heart.Nothing ever changed in your attitude or in your actions.You were always the same high-spirited friend I had always known.Now you are gone, and never to return.You time of health and youth had ended, and thebook of your loving, careless life had come to a close.You left with pride in your eyes and love in your heart till your last and final breath.Each say without you is filled with even more torture then the day before.Tears fall every time I relive a memory orsee a picture that reminds me of when you were alive.My heart is broken, and shall never be mended.You took the pieces with you, and will carry them always.For you may be gone, my dear sweet friend,but your memory will live in my heart for all time.-In memory of PennyMarch 5, 1993 - May 30, 2002**I stand upon the threshold of the tavern of Ryllian, cloaked in apprenticeship, stricken with glee.  Upon the grasp of my consciousness I devour the thought, "I, Valiant of Ryllian, do solemely vow..." and yet my words fail me... I am not yet a Bard.I thirst for the light, gay sounds of others laughing from their breasts, cheeks a blaze with cheer, and eyes aflame.  To lust whole-heartedly for the sparkle in their eyes, the contentedness of their smile.Yet, a voice calls out to me from a long lost place, known only in legend as 'Babylon', with such a sweet, gingerly voice, full of life and vitality.  A tune fills my mind, yet eludes me, and like a rabbit I chase after it, clutching ever so in futility, and then it is gone.  Like dusk, washing away the rays of hope.  Tonight, I shall linger no more... Tonight, I stand on the threshold of Ryllian... I am home.**My life, my love i give to thee,Your soaring heart that set me free,On wings of love,And winds of change,Fear not my love, its all for thee.Tho time may change the way we look,With loveing eyes still we look,upon one another as not a day has passed,So in the end, through good and bad,And no matter what I say and do,Remember just one thing from me,I do it all for thee.**No fear, but feelings	Some willing, some notNo tears for crying,	Just dry, restless eyesNo breath for speaking,	Only pale, parted lipsNo feelings but fear,	Why give me this?**"Baby when you are gone I feel the pain that you feel when I am gone. But since you found someone else to be your princess I feel like I have lost you forever. Maybe one day we will meet again. But until then I will have to find another person to be my prince. I hope that day will come sooner then laterNow I know what I had in my arms. I think what they say is true."You never knew what you had until its gone".So for now I will say good bye. Hope we meet one day. Love you and never will forget the memories that we had shared together those days. **Dark AnthemMidnights Darkness at high noonFlying missles spelling doomLife taken in a rushAs the cities roar was hushedDigging for bodies in a huddleWading thru a pile of rubbleA nation driven by pride and greedIs the perpitrator of this deedA nation writheing in painNo on them will bombs rainDeath decay in the airThe lives of many were lost there9-11-2001Detecated in honor of those who gave thier life in detication to save othersThanks NYPD, NYFD your deeds are not nor will beforgottenby-David E Wilson**Comfortable.  Close.  Take me in.  Humbly accept my love.  Let the cinders ignite once more.  Search your heart, learn of it's passion.  You can see the heavens shine through that passion.  I possess nothing of value, not even my soul.  Please me, please not your own soul,  for I encompass the entrails of existence.  Having been said, shall it be so.**Tis' our music that lifts the soul,Tis' our heart that lightens the burden,Tis' our bravery that will not falter,And our courage rivaled by none that will take us further,The bardic ways lost for someStill burn in the hearts of a few,We sweep the land to help some outWe Bards are always True,Our music lifts the soulA moment of fun in the sun,For a lute, flute, bagpipe or violinWe play music all day for fun,Our hearts are as big as anyYet seen around this place,For whom all we help every dayIt always leaves a smiling face,The bravest of brave are we the bardsWho fight when we must,But never fear for we are bardsFor in us you can trust,Our courage comes out quick and fastWhen we are put to the test,But when pushed and shoved never fearFor we are not like the rest,Tis' our music that lifts the soul,Tis' our heart that lightens the burden,Tis' our bravery that will not falter,And our courage rivaled by none that will take us further.**My Mistress I beseech theeI call you for my fateI see the corruption about meAnd yearn for your cold embrace**poems poems on the walloh my! oh my! i see you allall so

of evil and death.She felt the essence of the tiny world fade...and slip away.Her white gown becoming crimson red as the blood ran forth from the thousands of wounds covering her body.Slowly unconsciousness came to her, while scenes from her past filled her mind.Suddenly death came to the small world, as the great goddesses fell into nothingness with her creation, forever.**Be still - lay down your troubled mindThe day is past and we are left behindAnd the wind sings soft lullabiesSo soothing, just close your eyesLet your arms surround usThrough the darkest nightOur love will hold usTill the dawn of morning light.Sleep - God watches over usAnd soon beautiful dreams will come trueCan't you feel his Spirit embracing your soul?Dream and in the secret of darkness your troubles shall unfold.**Bright as morning sun,Yet dark as midnight sky.Two faces that I wear,Showing only one to passers by.My eyes glow with an inner light,My smile warms you from within,Yet, darkness reigns inside my heartAnd sorrow fills me yet again.Once I was an innocent,Once my heart was wholeUntil cruel fate stole my love, Tearing asunder my soul.Now I live two lives in one,The secret mine to keep.Though the whole world hears my laughter,None other hears me weep.In the darkness of the night,Deep within my mindI often wonder of myself,Of the me' I left behindAnd I wonder, somedayWill my fear be put asideAllowing me to meet myself,The self I strive to hide,I wonder if my heart will heal,And if my soul will mend,Shall I ever find the courageTo accept fair love again?With a sigh I realizeI never can return,That all the lessons of my lifeCannot be unlearned.Yet hope still lives within my heartThat I shall find the cure,That my light will one day conquer my darknessAnd the two will be one once more.**It was easier to lieAnd hide the hurt and emptinessTo smile instead of cryI didn't want to face the factMy life is full of painAnd I long to stop my bleeding heartAnd maybe smile againCause I feel oh -so-forgottenSo betrayed and so aloneWithout a trace of forgiveness,And no soul to call my ownI didn't want to admit the factI cannot spread my wingsAnd my happiness meltedInto tears and other thingsIts hard for me to hide the factMy wishes have to home And return to anguishBow my head and cry alone..**A vision came to me from the skyAn image so beautiful it filled my eyeWith a wink and a glanceI knew I had to take a chanceSlowly I approched this image to beTo find out it was very important to meEmbracing this great vision, came a blastFor it was my father from the past**I'd been holding itAnd it seemed nearly to fall away from meAs though I was fleeing back to my first conditionWhile dreaming for my lastI had reached himIt was not even a questionThat his veins bore royal bloodDestruction, Madness, and Death waited outsideTrouble stretched above us longer then the skyI would perish in the flameIt's the only light we've got in all this darknessI moved into the light, His kingdom, and how I am delightedLaughing and gesturing and moving aboutFaces underwent a changeHe grinned, his teeth gleaming like a light houseAnd his laugh comming up out of himLike the beginning of an earthquakeHe immediatly began confiding in me"There's a lot you don't know.But you are going to find out the world hasn't changed.You can see the darkness."I was aware only a moment, that the world waited ousideHe wants me to live this lifeWhatever it isI let out my breathAnd it hasn't stopped til this day.         --}@ Zephy @{--**inside i am dying...thinking of what was...outside i am crying...what a lost cause...i don't really know what
