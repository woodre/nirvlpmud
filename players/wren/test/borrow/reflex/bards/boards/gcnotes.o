tmp_text "I guess I'll break the virgin-ness of our board here...*8)  I was approached a few days ago by Zidane about joining the bards...Sweetpeahad informed me that he had spoken to Storm earlier in the day...and sinceStorm happened to be on, I asked him what he had thought of him...apparentlyStorm had felt he may not be right, and asked him a lot of questions whichI guess Zidane could not answer to Storm's satisfaction...I spoke withZidane, and let him know that we did not feel that he'd fit right now, andhis response was that he would await our decision.  I tried to get him tounderstand that that was our decision, but for the last few days he has beenasking me now and then if we've made up our minds yet.As for my personal feelings, I can't remember what it was about, but I doknow that Zidane once said or did something that got my good German temperflaring and we argued...though, like I said, I can't remember what it was.I suppose that's the reason I have a feeling he may not fit in as well...Just thought I'd give ya all a heads up in case he asks any others...*8)Star**Ok...the background for the upcoming comversation with Zidane is this..From the moment I logged in today he was complimenting me, my stuff, mynew twins...then asked me to party...I made some excuse...I didn't wannatake him.  There was then a lot of knight bashing going on in the green..and Zidane cheerfully joined in the fun...Guenhwyvar says: blah..knights are just too full of themselvesGuenhwyvar says: its all about what can you do for them it seemsZidane says: they are goody too shosYou ask "Geez Zidane..and you wanted to party with me??  Fine way to showit..insulting my allies..."Zidane tells you: i never knew?!Zidane tells you: you are an allied knight???You tell zidane what?  That we're allies?  All bards are knight allies...Zidane tells you: i am soooo sorry, i am sorry for killing the knight gurdsand everything i am so sorryYou tell zidane You killed the knight guards??  Aren't they a bit tough?Zidane tells you: noooone-sence they are a bit hard but they pay upZidane tells you: they are 2k killsZidane tells you: they are actually simple reallyYou tell zidane You also sorry for tryin to get into the bardic guild andaskin Journey if Brian could be killed??Zidane tells you: forgot about that, he is an eaty kill really, but i am sorryfor that toYou tell zidane how would you know he's easy?Zidane tells you: i can consider him, marketeer thingI would think it obvious at this point that whether he can answer someone'squestions correctly or not...we don't want him in the guild.  I did ask Blade if he can be criminal'd for admitting it to me...but so far he's noton the list...dunno if he can be added by hear-say or not.By the way, I did edit the conversation, but only took out the rest ofthe knight bashing going on in the room around me, and my conversation withBlade.  That is the whole of what was said between Zidane and me.Star**Reflex has said not to ever let someone in again after they have leftthe bards...or, of course, anyone we had to toss out...so here's thelist of the ones who have so far left...he doesn't have it hardcodedyet, so check this, as well as criminal list before lettin someone inif you're not sure...*8)RavenknightMosobpShadowmanThx for your cooperation...*grin*Star**Bard GCs are first and foremost individuals, with different ideas of whatmakes a good Bard and what is best for the guild.  This is a good thingsince we all admit different types of people and that makes the guildmore diverse as a whole.I'm posting some of the things I do just to generate discussion, not as amodel to follow.  Please feel free to post your own methods and thoughtson the topic.1. Be careful about who you let in.  I always start interviews with thebasic "Why do you want to join?"  In my mind there really isn't a correctanswer here, it's more a question of how they answer.  I get a lot of"I like music" and "I like poetry".  Both of those are great and importantaspects of being a Bard, but presented in such a bland and uncreativefashion I have to wonder what this person will addto the style of the guild.  People with flare and style catch myeye much more quickly.2. The same general rule of thumc applies to approving bardsfor new ranks.  Some poems/songs/stories simply looklike they were thrown together in 3 minutes.  All of these, but the storymost of all, are immortal reflections of the individual and the guild.Don't settle.3.  And, finally, don't be afraid to say no.  Don't let prospectivespressure you into a rush decision.  Saying no is not un-bardic and evil,it simply reflects that we have standards.  If you are unsure, or don'tfeel like you have the time to make an adequate judgement call, pass the buck to a fellow GC--we're here to help eachother.  We canalso use this board to discuss doubts about poems/prospects/etc.In sum, things are going great so far and there are some wonderful membersof this guild--let's make sure that we maintain high quality standardsin all aspects of the guild.  Set a good example for future generationsto follow.Huzzah!Raphael**I was looking over the more recent batch of poems and while there weresome quite good ones, there were also some truly terrible ones.  I don'texpect the next Robert Frost to be hidden in our ranks, but I think it is reasonable to expect that whatever gets posted shows some degreeof effort on the part of the aspiring bard.  I know that sometimes people are tired and don't have the time to look over material whenbards are clamoring for time and attention.  If this is the case, simplytell them you want to look at it later and have them mail it to you.For examples of the type of poem I would like to avoid, check out Master'sand Willierut's (for a great example of the type of poem I would love tosee more of, check out the poem that precedes these two).  I'm (almost)totally open when it comes to theme and subject matter of the poem, I ammuch more interested in effort.Thanks for your time,Raphael (Huzzah!)**In the case of Willierut I gave permission to be a bitlenient on that one, he is a young one and Sweetpea andStar are tutoring him a bit.  They rejected him beforethat for a peom that was considerably worse.I agree though that the poems need to see higherquality, as do the stories.  No offense to anyonehere, but so far Raph and Breezy's stories are thebest on the board, the rest are just acceptable, notexceptional.  I'd like to see that quality improve.And if you guys approve yet another 'invasion'story I'll scream.  Breezy's was enough, no need tokeep writing more stories along those lines.  Tellthem to be original.  With Mosobp gone I may removehis story entirely as its almost a copy of Breezy's itseems.-Reflex**Is there any way to remove this?  Why did he feel compelled topost a second time?**Done**I did see that his second one was removed, but I can answer the questionas to why he wrote it.  He told me he's not good at long stories, and sowrote a couple of short ones.  I haven't looked at anything by him yet cosSweetpea suggested I talk to you Raph...*8)  And once he spoke to me I justfigured it had been suggested because no one before has wanted to write morethan one short story, as opposed to one long one.  Do we have a lengthrequirement on them anyway?  Or just the standard that they have to be reallygood??Star**How long are they supposed to be anyway?**In the next few days I hope to postsome basic guidelines in the book to help clarify what we expect interms of poems, stories, and songs.  Not so much "They must be about X"but letting people know the difference between a story, a narrative, anda testimony.  Stories have tension, a beginning, a middle and an end.There is some sort of conflict which is resolved by the end (or not, butthat needs to be equally clear).  I am much more concerned about qualityover length, so there is no need for people to postmore than once on the board, assuming their first post is good.  If it's notgood, a second post does nothing to rectify the situation..:)Huzzah!Raphael**Hmm...seems we don't have that ability, though I had thoughtwe were going to...Reflex??  Is that in the works anywhere??For now I guess, just re-post the whole Banned List, and thenlet Reflex know which one needs removed cos it's old...*8)**RavennightMosobpShadowmanYoshimitsuRavynRoyThere's the latest...keep in mind if an update is needed to re-post theentire list, then get Reflex to remove the old.  An ability we willeventually have on our own...*8)Star**When are we gonna get our own brand of underroo's?**Soon, I am just having trouble locating a thong inyour size....**I'm still wanting for those under roosI want a big picture of reflex on the crotch of mine**Great job on those FAQ's, much appreciated.  Shouldhelp some of the younger bards especially, and eventhe rest of them will at least know *why* they gettheir stories rejected....-R**Hullo bards,Glaxgor approached me this morning asking me to let him into the bards, saying that he had Storm's approval. I replied saying that he may have Storm's, but not mine and would have to prove himself bardly to me before I would bring him to the guild. I could not stay on for long so I told him that we would talk later.As I came back on, Morpheus had his pet in the village green. Glaxgor was attempting to kill it and is now a criminal. Just wanted to give you a heads up.-Breezy**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
