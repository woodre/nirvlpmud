tmp_text "There came a time in the history of the bardic guild of Ryllian, a time when a dark shadow fell across the land.This was the time of the "Prophet" and his followers.  The Prophet and his followers, "The Nameless Ones" cameinto Ryllian in search of power, this caused uneasinesswithin the ranks of the bards.  What were the true intentions of these followers who were clouded in mystery?The mission of the members of the bards guild was to travel the land, and to bring back knowledge and talesof new places and people.  The Namless ones were a sightto behold.  Many of them wore nothing more than simplerobes and attacked with their bare hands, but some could strike down some of the most powerful creatures known in the realms.  Obviously these men and women were worth studying.Many of the bards were given free access to the libraryof the Prophet, and they hungrily devoured this new knowledge.The followers of the Prophet were bound to assist the bards in their travels, and those who dared to lift a hand against themwere struck down by the Prophet's fury.  Seeing such awesome displays of power caused some bards to turn their back on theteachings of Harper.It was around this time that the bardic Master Saber becameless visible around the realm, along with some of the seniormembers of the guild.  Without their leader, there was an increase in tension among the ranks of the guild commanders.One of these commanders, a bard named Devon, decided that heno longer wanted to be associated with his fellow bards.  Many times people were questioning what is "Bardic behavior?"  Wearyof the struggle against his own guildmates, Devon decided to seek the path of power, and turned to the Prophet for help.It was not long after that Saber was noticeably absent from theaffairs of the bardic guild.  The "Nameless Ones" grew in number,and in power.  Soon there would be a great divide, that would leave one group in a position of power, and the other would liein their wake...but that, is another story...Tale collected from the wanderings of Devon, former Guild Commander of the bards of Ryllian.  This tale put to paper and ink by Dagger, Master of Riddles.**In Nirvana's storied history there have been many individuals who stood out from the crowd.Most of these people were generally good or evil.A few of them felling from grace into the darkness.A very few of those managed to redeem them selves and return to the light.One such individual was called Saber.He had surrendered to the dark seduction of a vampiress and fallen from the light.He gained much power in his time in the darkness and became a powerfull vampire lord.He wandered wide and far across the land.One one such journey he was encountered by the goddess Crysea.The goddess converted him from the darkness back into  the light.She gave him the task of restoring those he could back into the light thru her.He traveled the land seeking out others who had been corrupted by the darkness.He joined the ranks of the bards and rallied many too the banner of the goddess.Several powerfull vampires also recieved the goddess blessing and strengthened the guild and the cause of good.Many of them became powerfull high ranking bards in thier own right.Delicate became a beloved guild mistress.She was the sweet nurturing mother of the guild.Several of the others became champions of the light and fought with the paladins against evil where ever it was found.Some became teachers and gave guidance to the younger members of the guild.That is a brief history of the guild from one has survived it.I have walked thru the darkness and returned to the light.Storm the former vampire lord and follower of crysea.88**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
