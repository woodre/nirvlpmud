new_text "   As I wonder across this great place, I hear of a great feat, that only thegreat have ever attempted. The Elemental Test.  Many have tried, the greatest have succeeded, and the ill prepared have failed. To be among these greatwarriors is such a great accomplishment, and to be the first bard, even better.    The first time that I stepped into the arena of this great task, I was easilydefeated by the great Flame.  I did not let this dampen my spirits, for this would be one task that I would keep attempting till I succeeded.   With the aid from some of our greatest allies, Cooper, Jarana, and Ghost.They went out of their way to let me tag along in their parties, being ever sogenerous to help me get the 300k in coins that I needed, just for the necessary heals.    Quickly, I traveled about, from place to place, acquiring the lightest and best equipment I could get.  Soon I was ready for the greatest quest I have had so far.  Taking time to listen to the words of wisdom from the those whohad tackled this great feat.  Checking and double checking that I had every-thing I needed, and that I had everything in line. I headed off again to meetmy fate.   Upon entering the arena, quickly I dropped my bag and grabbed the few things I needed from it. Not wanting to let it weigh me down. Now I was Ready.   First was Granite, knowing from the first time that this was a monster I could easily handle from the last time.  He seemed to die ever so slowly,singing tunes of elemental, eventually he took his last breath and fell to thefloor.   Then I was attacked by the great Flame, knowing that if I didn't watchmyself closely, I would meet my demise.  So, I left him attack with all his might, while I focused on keeping myself in good shape.  Knowing that soon he would slow down, and then I would have my chance.  After what seemed like no time at all he calmed down, then I stepped up to the plate. Attacking him with more force and tunes of elemental, soon he to became a victim of my power and strength.   Next was Wave, knowing after just a couple attacks, that just hitting with my sword wasn't going to do.  I began to sing tune after tune of element. Seeing this hurt him more than anything else I did in my feeble attack.Proudly I sang with pride, knowing that the great bardic powers that we hold within our voice.  Soon he to fell to my attack, to my own surprise that I hadeven made it this far.    Wind came up next, he attacked very aggressively, but could not with stand being attacked. He died very quickly.   Finally was the last monster, he stood before me with great strength.  Not being afraid to use what heals I had left in my bag, I attacked with everything I had left in me.  Sing tunes of elemental after tune, hitting him left and right with my mighty sword.  On the verge of being so full and unable to take another drink of my shake, he finally succumbed to my attack. To myself I gave out a sigh of relief.  To my great surprise, I had finished one of the greatest tasks a person can accomplish here.  The best part would have to be getting the nice title and picking out one of the best pieces of equipment one could ever ask for. 88"

tmp_text "Once upon a time, shrouded in the mists of yesteryear, Saber formedthe bards.  He envisioned a peaceful people, fighting with none of the other inhabitants of the land, singing, dancing, and bringing joyeverywhere they roamed.  His dream was realized, and the Bards were ahappy bunch.  Unfortunately, there are those who despise peace and joy,and want nothing more than to destroy it whenever they can.  Eventuallysituations arose where they would attempt to harm Saber's peaceful bards,which created quite a problem.  With their peaceful beliefs and happy-go-lucky lifestyles, the bards were appalled at the idea of violence, but hadto have some recourse to right the wrongs done against them.  Saber satdown with Molasar and Sandman to solve the problem, and thus the Alliancewas born.  A room was constructed upstairs in the bards' guild...a peacefulroom, with a fire kept always crackling on the hearth.  Alexander wasplaced on guard there, and tha paladins were to share this room with the bards.  In this room, one could see Alexander about joining the Alliance.Bards could see him about wielding two weapons, and paladins could obtainthe coveted bardswords.  Both guilds prospered under the arrangement, andthe wrongs against the bardic people were righted by the paladins' holy wrath.A certain bard had business one day on the other side of a dangerous land.He called his strongest pet to help in any peril that might occur, and setout.  Not far into his journey he noticed he was being followed.  It seemedas if more than one of the strangers were on his trail and he readied himselffor the inevitable as best he could.  Before long, they attacked:  three ofthem, armed to the teeth and members of the most evil group of people in theland.  Loyal to the end, the bard's pet jumped in to defend his master, andwas brutally slain in battle.  Injured from the mental backlash of losinghis companion, the bard knew he could not survive much longer.  He ran forthe safety of Ryllian, calling for the paladins as he went.  Before longthey started to appear and quickly spread throughout the area searchingfor the assailants.  It wasn't long before one of them sounded the alarm.They had been found, and cornered.  A viscious fight ensued, steal clashingand blood flowing.  The paladins eventually gained the upper hand and thebattle came to an end.  The evil were vanquished once again, and the paladinssaw the bard safely through the dangerous lands and to his destination.Other advantages also sprang from the alliance.  People from the two groupsfrequently united for hunting parties throughout the land, together purgingit of dragons, goblins, wraiths, and other such evil creatures.  There weremany marraiges between the two groups, and children played happily togetherin front of the fire, safe at the feet of Alexander.  The good prospered.Then, suddenly, an evil greater than anyone ever imagined spread across theland.  The Alliance was defeated, the bards and paladins destroyed, theguildhalls in ruins.  The lands of Nirvana went through many years in this dark period, and new forces of good sprung up here and there.  Now it is timefor the return of the bards, the reconstruction of their guildhall, and fornew alliances to be formed.  The happy voices of singing bards have finallyreturned to the land.  You'd best watch out, lest some overly happy bard bouncea bauble of light off your head.**	In the days of when I was a child, I remember how the now fabled warriors were. Their platemail was not always gleaming and strength not always unyielding. They bled red and cried the same tears as you or I.  Most of all, I recall how they stood for a chosen cause. On the foggy coastal plains of Nirvana, many brave warriors fought for the causes of good and held evils at bay. My mind rests on the war between the invading goblin armies and the Knights Templar with their Allies.         The sun rarely shone through those stormy clouds and the land seemed wrapped in a blanket of darkness. The very wind itself seemed to howl in anguish as it blew over those goblin and ogre ridden shores. These armies were building and churning, waiting for the right moment to break through and storm Nirvana, pillaging and killing as they went. The time was ripe for the land to plunge into an era of darkness and turmoil.        It was decided that the Knights and Allies would stand up and bind together, forming a wall through which no evil could pass. So warriors took up their weapons and others offered their own special skills in any way they could. Healers would heal, and non-combatants would provide a steady flow of resources and encouragement. Those lands became a proving ground for the Knights and their Allies. Rifts that were once tearing began to close and many new lasting bonds were formed.         The first hours of battle tested their strength, quick reflexes and endurance. Assassins trained by the goblin armies were sent out to murder Knights, Allies and unwarily townsfolk. These dark forms would creep into any unlocked nook or cranny that held an ounce of valor. Knights stood watch in the castle order to protect their resting brothers and sisters. Justin was one of the many that guarded the castle from intruders and fought those who dared risk falling under his deadly blade. The Knights quickly realized they must drive the invaders into the sea and back to their own unknown land.        A host of Templar Knights with their Allies led by Stone stormed the northwestern front as a small entourage led by Ghost attacked at the southwestern end. Not knowing how vast the goblin armies had grown, the two divisions had planned to split the opposing forces and meet in the middle. As the battle progressed, it became clear that Ghost and Pino needed to regroup with the main campaign. Hordes of goblins and ogres had surged around them, preventing safe passage to return. It was hard and some even say that Ghost fell under the blade of the goblins only to come back to the living and continue on. Finally, after much battle, they reconvened with the larger party and began to fight again. Together they found that they could defeat the goblin invasion.        Hours of bloodshed turned into days and still the fierce sounds of battle rang throughout the land. Yet even in the days that followed morale continued to rise and more and more people stood up to assist these brave warriors in their cause. People remembered the days of old when the guild of Templar Knights stood proud and unified. They began to speak the names that were being written in history like Stone, Jarana, Whitedawn, Ghost, Daredevil, Beowulf, Cooper, Little, and so many others.**	Slowly as the week progressed the huge army of 8,200 ogres and goblins were beaten back and only two strongholds remained. The Knights and Allies had finally reached the goblin base camp and the cave of the red dragon clan. The dragon king, Falesgauntriax, King of the Reds, had allied himself with the goblins and was prepared to fight. A short council was held and it was decided that the dragons were a greater threat and a band of warriors set out to invade the cave. Once inside, they were met by onslaughts of darklings and numerous minor dragons. Finally, they reached the massive dragon. The air in the royal cavern reeked of sulfur and the beasts soft underbody was encrusted with jewels. Unwillingly to turn back and give up after coming so far, they bravely faced him. Flames singed and burned; smoke made it hard to breathe and yet after the air cleared, the mighty dragon king lay defeated.         A promise of victory was on the mind of every individual who participated in those long battles. Only one windy tent stood between them and then they could restore the peace of Nirvana. Again the forces regrouped to plan the siege on the base camp. Together, the Knights with their Allies stormed the lonely stronghold and defeated the enemies outside of the tent. Inside, however, lay Garshlog, King of the Goblins decked out in pounds of jewels and an uncountable number of robes. Garshlog was huge, tall, very, very obese, ugly, and smelled of a mix of rotten eggs, rancid pork, and two month old pizza. Stone led the attack and fought bravely with his brothers and sisters. Even the King of the Goblins could not stand up to the Knights with their Allies and with a loud, reverberating thud, he crashed to the ground, dead.         Tired and worn, the Knights and Allies stood united in victory. What remained of the goblin army dissipated into darker realms or was killed. Only a small clan of defeated Red Dragons remained hidden deep within their caves.         Rumors had been spreading like wildfire that the late King had somehow found the mighty sword Excalibur and kept it with him at all times. Whispers said that it was hidden in his personal tent. Stone spotted a hidden treasure room and found the mighty sword Excalibur hidden in a treasure chest. The magnificent sword once wielded by King Arthur was presented to Stone in honor of his leadership, skill, and many other attributes on the battlefield.        Silence washed over the land as the sounds of the fierce battle fell quiet. The invading armies had been defeated and their strongholds were destroyed. The coastal plains lay soaked in blood and chaos. Something needed to be built in order for no enemy to get so close to overrunning the land of Nirvana again. Not merely a watchtower, but a new Templar stronghold that could stand up to such opposing forces.         It was decided that with the wealth earned off of the defeated soldiers would build a castle to prevent invaders from getting so close again and keep watch on the cave of the dragons. This castle would become the new home for the Knights Templar and would be welcome to their Allies at all times. Not long after this, Fortress Stone stood proud overlooking the vast oceans to the west. Its thick walls could withstand any siege and the test of time.        Slowly, people came to the fortress and built up a small town. This grew into a booming port-city eventually, which they named New Ares. Shops, inns, and taverns sprung up and with this more people arrived. They told tales of a time that was now passed of gleaming platemail and unyielding strength. Even now, people still rejoice when they hear about the warriors that fought for them, and will forever.Many thanks to the brave warriors who fought for this land and the wizards that help guide them. This historic event was captured topaper by Breezy the Bard.**It was several years ago, more then I would like to admit, that wordcame to the lands of Nirvana that a ancient and evil creature had onceagain been sighted.  As usually happens the news traveled quickly tothe Bards of Ryllian and the family got together.Something must be done, we cannot let Icing Death roam free, toomany good people will get hurt, Blazzer spoke up, there were nodsof agreement from those gathered there.Fipogee stood up, and a hush fell over the room, usually he was theone with the silly joke or the gag to play on everyone, but this timehe wasnt.  He had a dead serious look on his face, as though he knewwhat was going to happen.  Ill go, I need a few people to go with methough.  He looked over to Blazzer and the old bard nodded at him,saying he would go with.Fipogee leaned over to Blazzer and asked him,I really think we should take one of the new guys with us, we need the power and at the same time it would be a wonderful learning experience for them.I think Bambua is our man, he shows a lot of promise, Ive beenwith him a lot lately, his head is in the right space.  He just needs some confidence.The two bards approached me and asked me to come with, I was nervous but I said that I would go.  I didnt want to disappoint them.  We collected our gear and the rest of the Bards gave us heals and food and drink for the trip.  They bid us their best luck and we were on our way.  Most of the journey there was a blurto me, I was too busy listening to the bards tell me what wasexpected of me.  They tried to keep it light with jokes and songs [Dalong the way but I knew that what we were doing was very dangerous.For the fight Blazzer was going to be leading against the beast, while Fipogee handled any monsters that joined the fight.  I was tasked with healing.  As I approached Icing Death, I had neverseen nor heard of a creature as foul as this one was.  It scowled at us from deep within its very being.  The fight itself was veryhard, we charged in and began weaving our songs through magic, the beast fought very tough it flung everything it had at us.  A few times I thought that I was going to loose my good friend, but we prevailed.  After long moments of fighting at our feet theblood of Icing Death and our own mingled, but it was his corpse laying at our feet, and us standing there victoriously.We returned to Ryllian to the cheers of not only the Bards and our allies the Paladins, but from some of the less then friendlymembers of our lands as well.  If this fight taught me anything about being a bard it was that if we work together nothing..nothing could stand in our way.  The lessons our Harper taught us are just too wise and together anything can be accomplished.**Once, during the dawn of the Second Age, when theBards were still newly formed, there existed a groupof holy warriors from the land of Rowan known as thePaladins.  The Bards of Ryllian quickly forged analliance with their neighbors and for the first timein recent memory, the tide of evil began to abate.Harper and the leader of the Paladins, Snowfire, wouldopen their festhalls for grand celebrations and theAlliance was much loved by all.Once, during the dawn of the Second Age, when the Bards were still newlyformed, there existed a group of holy warriors from the land of Rowanknown as the Paladins.  The Bards of Ryllian quickly forged anAlliance with their neighbors and for the first time in memory, the tide of evil began to abate.  Harper and the leader of the Paladins, Snowfire, would open their festhalls for grand celebrations and the Alliancewas much loved by all.However, while they were in retreat, the forces of darkness were not defeated; theyregrouped and sought an opportunity.  One presented itself inthe person of Balathuil.  Balathuil was a paladin and almost as accomplishedas the triad of Snowfire, Arioch, and Wendell.  However, their longevityand the refusal of the other paladins to allow them to retire preventedBalathuil from attaining the heights of power he craved.  At first,Balathuil tried to lose himself in his work in an effort to ignore thefeelings of envy that gnawed away at his soul.  But his long journiesalone on the road only have the darkness time to whisper in his ear.Every time a paladin would fall on the field of battle, Balathuil wouldwonder if they would have survived had he been leading the charge.Every time Snowfire made a decision, Balathuil would seek some flaw inhis logic.  Finally, consumed with hatred and crazed from the whisperingdarkness, Balathuil came upon a plan: to save the paladins he would killSnowfire.  With the inept leader disposed of, Balathuil would lead theguild to new heights of glory!Finally, the night of the new moon came and Balathuil set out on hiswretched task.  He coated his blade with the poisonous nyteshade plant and stole into the Commander's wing of the castle.  The unsuspectingguard assumed Balathuil was there to ask the Triad a question--it is saidhe cried as the poisoned sword was run through him, both for his failureto perform his duty and for the soul of Balathuil.  As the guard's blooddripped on Balathuil's armor, it twisted the steelchanging it into a matte-black mockery of the platemail Balathuil hadworn as a Paladin.Balathuil burst into Snowfire's room, surprising him.  Although he waswithout his armor, Snowfire quickly armed himself with the greatswordthat Mordrake, a noble of Rowan, had gifted him.  Their battle wasgreat--Snowfire, without his armor, could not strike a final blow with-out exposing himself to the poison of the sword and Balathuil beganto realize, to his increasing horror, that Snowfire's skill with a bladewas unmatched, for he could not penetrate his defenses.  For hours theyfought, the other paladins forbidden to interfere with the melee.  Finally,the sun began to rise and Balathuil, fearing he would lose the giftsthe darkness had granted, pressed for an advantage.  His haste proved tobe his undoing.  Snowfire evaded his wild swings and drove his bladethrough Balathuil's torso in a single, mighty stroke.  Balathuil's bloodpooled into the final shadows of the night and he sunk away intonothingness.It is said that the spirit of Balathuil remains, beneath even the darkest shadow, locked in torment with the knowledge of his failings.**	Born into this new world, I am a child of innocence.  No telling where I come from, or where my roots lie.  Abandoned at infancy, I was raised by a household of strangers that came to love me as their own.  I, Mercy, am unique; I have intensely captivating violet eyes and long, wavy brown hair.   Encased by an aura of purity, I am accompanied by an unblemished soul and captivating ability to bring peace to those in my presence.	I have survived; the fire destroyed everything and the invasion left many for dead.  Some ran away, others died trying.  The entire village is gone, vanished from the earth as if never existed.  I had to find a new home; I was desperate to find the place I belonged.	I traveled for days along dusty roads to these lands.  I heard a lot about Nirvana in my time, and finally was about to see for myself if what I heard was true.  I was completely taken back by what I found.  People of all types and personalities, both the good and the bad, reside here.  This is a place of creation, excitement, and the unusual; I have decided to make Nirvana my home.  	Word spreads quickly around these parts, I've noticed.  There is never a dull moment when there are so many different types in one place, all trying to abide by the minimal rules to avoid jail or banishment.  It's no out of the ordinary to be mistaken for something you're not, or to be challenged by someone, just so they can prove themselves.  This world is very competitive; people here strive to stand out from the crowd to be noticed for their accomplishments.		There are many different groups here, each with a set common interest amongst its members.  I have found my place amongst a guild; I am a bard.  I am happy with my new life I will live upon the merry, fight for the reign of good, and live thru song until the day I die.  **All was quiet, content and serene.  People lay in bed yet, weary of what was about to unfold.It was in the wee hours of the morning and I awoke for and early, long day of traveling.Not many alliance members were awake.  Although two had he same idea that I had.  Master Yorickof the Warriors and Shadowman, a fellow Bard just awoke for their daily business. Ready and excited,I went out traveling, searching for new people and hope to find new friends and share the knowledge Ihave attained with hopes of attaining more knowledge to share with my Kin.	Out of nowhere, raised a clatter though the alliance, "SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE KNIGHT'S GATES!" Yorick and Shadowman found that Legion and Rek were at the Knight's guild hall again.  They were in the process of, yet again, breaking into the knight's guild. Yorick, brave and relentless, equipped himself and rushed to the alliance member's gates to defend his friend's privacy and possessions.  He fought brave and alone, until Shadowman and I rushed to aid in his battle.  We kept him as healed as possible, but Legion was well prepared.  It took but of us Bards aiding Yorick to drive Legion out of the guildhall. 	Spent and broke, Shadowman left after all he could do.  After a few spats at the gates, Cleipa woke. Hearing the clatter he readied himself to help out Yorick against, now, Legion and Rek.  The two evil Shardaks hunted down Yorick and had him cornered at the church.  Cleipa rushed to ask what was going on and Yorick explained all that has already unfolded.  During this, I went to get healing potions and aids for them to heal them and to fight off the persistent evildoers.Mad and distraught, they tried coaxing us into their homeland, the Wastelands.  We were not about to fall into their trap.  We were more concerned of our ally's possessions rather than defeating the evil creatures.  Upon this, Cooper and Sweetpea arose to hear the battle cries.  Cooper rushed to the Ally's guild to guard the gates from any further damage.  This seemed to be the best idea, considering that he was one of the greatest throughout the land.  Sweetpea rushed to aid me to heal Yorick's raging battle against now both Legion and Rek. I was now broke, spent and tired, I knew I would get in the way, I left with only words of encouragement for my fellow allies.  	The battle raged on and on between Good and Evil.  Eventually both sides were tired and drained.  After about a day of relentless battle in this ongoing war, Legion and Rek went back to their evil master and gave up on the day's foiled plans.Once again, the battle waits the next day us allies have to rise together, to drive away the evil in this land. This day has taught me that we must always be prepared for anything and everything.  Remember all that you have learned and attained, be ready for anything, and most of all, we are Bards, it is our duty to share our Knowledge with all whom is good and righteous, in hopes to overcome evil throughout this land.Another day's events, entered into the Bards history books.	By: Journey**He had heard the legends.  He had had prepared for battle.  Soon the AXE would be his.Razberrypopartsalad heard that Tol'kar's axe was a worthy prize for his amory.  He needed such weapons in his possession for the up coming invasion.  But with his arch Nemisis Maxy still active the invasion would have to wait.  No matter how hard he tried he always seemed to miss this elusive vamp sometimes but just a few seconds.But first things first the AXE is needed.  It lies in a museum with many other artifacts perhaps in time he will aquire these items as well.  but these thoughts are of the future he needs to stay in the now.  He nears the doorway.Odd its just floating there in midair nothing behind it strange.  There are many strange things in this world thoughnot everything makes sense here.  In fact very few things made sense in this world.  Enough looking, Raz slides though the door.Ahh the clear orb and black pedestal.  Now what was he suppose to do.  Yes he remembers placing his hand on the orb he says,"museum".  A bright Flash!  He's no longer in the void,  he now stands in a vast clear room.  He slides north along the hall.Raz come to a readout of previous battles.  He spits on the name of Maxy who defeated Jerek.  "Soon my name will be here" he thinks to himself.  Raz makes a selection...  Tol'kar...  Now is Raz's time let the games begin....**As I stroll across this great land, killing all the evil that crosses my path.Going from realm to realm, gaining as many coins and experience as I can, all the while learning more and more about my lore. Learning it to the best of my ability.  With my trusty phoenix, Sweety, at my side there is not much that we can not destroy.One day I get in my head a wild burr, to kill the Queen ant. I have heard It has only been done once before by a group of characters.  So, to the forest I run, to stocking up on splooge and jellies. Getting as many as Ican carry in my handy little bag.  Once they are all packed I head backto the Hall of Images.Upon entering the hall there is a board, showing all who has killed the Queen ant. To get my name upon that board would be such a feat, andto be the first bard to do it at that. Now, that would be a great honor forguild and for myself. Killing off ant by ant, getting myself closer to the queen, one by one wekill them off. Placing part after part into the bag. Sweety and I conquerthem all. As we kill off the Royal ants just before the queen, I sit and ask"can I do this by myself?". Knowing my lore I should be fine. I take Sweety with me, but do not allow her to attack. For if I should die I donot want to sacrifice her for this silly move on my part.Upon entering the room, armed with only a summersword and the rest of myarmor. I cast agony upon her, then attack. Though her many hits and colorfulhits, I thrust my sword deep within her body. Using as many tunes of elementalpower as I can before I must calm, and heal. As I weaken her a little in the firstround, quickly I sing a song of  regeneration upon myself, eating as many splooge and jelly as I can to get back to health. Attacking again, once againletting as many tunes of elemental power, escape from my recoder as fast as I can play them, and stabbing my sword deep. Causing more and more damagewith each strike and each song. She gets pretty weak as I must calm again and detox.  Just now I realize, my lore has done me well, and so has the knowing how to use it in combat situations. To this I thank our creators for giving us all that they have to make us this great.Now I attack her again, with greater enthusiasm. Hitting her with such force, and singing tunes of elemental power left and right. To my amazement, shefinally succumbs to the greatness that has attacked her. For armed with my lore and my mighty sword, I have over taken her.For now, I can be proud knowing that I have done something for the good of my guild.  I have proved that a Bard can do anything.**   As I wonder across this great place, I hear of a great feat, that only thegreat have ever attempted. The Elemental Test.  Many have tried, the greatest have succeeded, and the ill prepared have failed. To be among these greatwarriors is such a great accomplishment, and to be the first bard, even better.    The first time that I stepped into the arena of this great task, I was easilydefeated by the great Flame.  I did not let this dampen my spirits, for this would be one task that I would keep attempting till I succeeded.   With the aid from some of our greatest allies, Cooper, Jarana, and Ghost.They went out of their way to let me tag along in their parties, being ever sogenerous to help me get the 300k in coins that I needed, just for the necessary heals.    Quickly, I traveled about, from place to place, acquiring the lightest and best equipment I could get.  Soon I was ready for the greatest quest I have had so far.  Taking time to listen to the words of wisdom from the those whohad tackled this great feat.

So, I left him attack with all his might, while I focused on keeping myself in good shape.  Knowing that soon he would slow down, and then I would have my chance.  After what seemed like no time at all he calmed down, then I stepped up to the plate. Attacking him with more force and tunes of elemental, soon he to became a victim of my power and strength.   Next was Wave, knowing after just a couple attacks, that just hitting with my sword wasn't going to do.  I began to sing tune after tune of element. Seeing this hurt him more than anything else I did in my feeble attack.Proudly I sang with pride, knowing that the great bardic powers that we hold within our voice.  Soon he to fell to my attack, to my own surprise that I hadeven made it this far.    Wind came up next, he attacked very aggressively, but could not with stand being attacked. He died very quickly.   Finally was the last monster, he stood before me with great strength.  Not being afraid to use what heals I had left in my bag, I attacked with everything I had left in me.  Sing tunes of elemental after tune, hitting him left and right with my mighty sword.  On the verge of being so full and unable to take another drink of my shake, he finally succumbed to my attack. To myself I gave out a sigh of relief.  To my great surprise, I had finished one of the greatest tasks a person can accomplish here.  The best part would have to be getting the nice title and picking out one of the best pieces of equipment one could ever ask for. 88**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
