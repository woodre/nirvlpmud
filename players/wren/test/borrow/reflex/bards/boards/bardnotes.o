tmp_text "I thought someone should take the initiative and put something downhere.  If you are reading this, congratulations on being accepted intothe bardic guild of Ryllian.  As one of the guild commanders, I wanted to pass a few words of wisdom along to all new members.I.  Be sure to remain in character at all times.  Try if at allpossible to keep your bard separate from other characters you mayhave.  This guild is based on roleplaying, and if you can't separatecharacters, this just simply will not work.II.  Remember, you are effective in combat, but a true bard valuesthe flair and style of magical weapons and spells to a boring sword that may be very deadly.III.  Lastly, do not be afraid to ask you fellow bards for help when youhave a question that you do not know the answer to.  The only time a bardwill not help you and should not help you is when you are completing a trial.  I encourage others to share their wisdom here for all to see.Respectfully,-Dagger-**Fellow Guild Commanders of the Bardic Guild.  Thanks to Vertebraker, thesponsor command is now fixed.  Please do not forget that we are not tryingto build up a huge membership immediately, choose wisely and ask othersbefore sponsoring someone if they are available.Respectfully,-Dagger-**Hey all, just a helpful note on your trials here.  Do not quit out of any trials until they're done or you stopped the trial.  Otherwise some rather bad consequnces may follow ( learned the hard way ).Have fun everyone!-Fleas**As I don't have scroll at the moment, if you could send any poem, song, orstory you wish me to approve to nirvanabard@yahoo.comI would appreciate it.  Or simply get another GC to approve you.Mail me here with a heads up and the process will go a lot quicker.HUZZAHRaph**Most of the trial comes down to k.i.s.skeep it simple stupid:)just do what your asked**Bards who are members of the Alliance are NOT to assist criminals in any way.  That includes usingheals or helpful spells on them such as distort.If you are reported as helping a criminal, theKnights or other Alliance members will reportthis to the Bard GC's, who if they find the claimto be true will permanantly remove you from the Alliance.Shardak are not to be helped under anycircumstances, whether you are in the Alliance or not as they represent death which is the opposite of what Bards represent.  Any Bard whohelps a Shardak will have their powers frozen andpotentially be removed from the guild.We need to be good members of the Alliance.  Thatdoes not mean that we have to follow the rules of the Templar guild.  However we DO need to follow the rules of the Alliance, which means that we do not help criminals.-Reflex**To all bards trying to attain level 6 - youudo not need to compose an original song, but it is encouraged.As such, if you decide to submit a non-original composition,you MUST give the author credit, either iin thesong title, or at the beginning or the end of the piece.Anyone who does not do this will NOT be approved until a wizard is able to remove the song and let you repost.  Bards do notsteal from each other, nor should you take credit for that which is not yours.--Dagger--**For those who would like to donate coins to the knights guild for guardshere ate the directions to to room that you need to be inFrom church:s,12w,s,4w,enter tower,2n,enter archway,3s,w,n.The command is cdonate (amount)here is an example:cdonate 1000Every bit helps even if all you can afford is 1000 coins.  If 10 peopledonate 1000 coins that will buy a guard.  If every person in the alliance donated 40kwe would get the knights an army.  I know it's a lot, but we need to help make sure thatwe help our alliance members out as best we can.  It is a bardic thing to do.If you can't afford to donate, don't feel pressured by this post, I just wanted to put a bug in everyone's ear.Thanks,Journey - Your fellow Bard**First off, hello!  I wanted to thank all of you for making this themost dynamic and enjoyable guild around.  We have more style in our pinkiesthen most guilds have in their entire roster (and don't let them forgetit!).  A few quick comments to mull over...1. Dagger is 100% correct.  Also note that poems and stories must be original works.  We don't expect you to be the next Seamus Heaney orRobert Frost...we are looking for a relfection of you.2. Journey is also 100% correct (how`s that for well-studied Bards?)  TheAlliance offers its members a number of unique resources.  Whether or notyou join is up to you, but if you do make that choice, you do so as a representative of this guild.  Don't be a leech  (boo, hiss) it's muchmore gratifying to contribute than it is to take.3. Reflex made this pretty clear in his post (99% correct..I`ll give himone to grow on) but as I flip through my book "Ways to Get Kicked out ofthe Bards" (which, I should say, is very very short) I notice that seriouslapses in in-character play (such as ading Shardak) is on the list.I can cross-reference this with the book "Ways to Make Raphael Mad". But, like I said, things are going great and I'm happy to have you all asmembers of my family.  Huzzah!Cheers,Raphael**These are to be done on your own.In general no one is allowed to help except for maybe a small clue.Please remember this and do them on your own.**Clues are to be given ONLY by a GC when they feelit is appropriate.  You are not entitled to a clueat all, and if a GC feels that you don't need one,they do not have to give one.  Read your lore, readthe scrolls, and remember that all of the currentGC's did the trials without a single clue given.Usually the answer is the one staring you in theface, the trials are not very difficult.  If you don't get it right away, give it a day or twobefore you go asking for a clue, you have no entitlement to advancing as fast as you want justbecause we don't charge experience for ranks.Don't make others do your thinking for you, youare Bards, you seek out knowledge on your own.-Reflex**Since we don't have edit functions in the Book of Stories yet, pleasediscuss your story with a GC _before_posting them.  If possible, mail them a copy to their email (mine is innote 5).  As Reflex has stated before, stories are the ultimate expressionof a bard, expect to be judged to a higher standardthan you were for your poem and song.  With luck, this will save you timeand possible frustration.  Most important, it ought to improve thequality of the final product, which is what we are all shooting for.HUZZAH!Raphael**Many thanks go out to Raphael for his work on addingsome personality to our lore files.  If you read the lore for any of your Bard abilities you will find somequotations attached now that demonstrate the spirit ofeach skill.  Have fun reading them, Raphael sure hadfun writing em!And be sure to thank the old guy when you see him.-Reflex**Handing light sources to Vampires is NOT Bardicbehaviour, in fact it could be construed as attacking a player.  If I hear of anyone doingthis they will have their powers frozen and possibly be removed from the guild if I feelit was intentional.Get it?  Got it?  Good.-Reflex**during my wanderings and travels i found a certain saying that i believe is great for the guild: Today we live, but by tomorrow today will be a story. The whole wide world, all human life, is one long story.-Anonymousanyway, that is all for now, thank you kindly for your time. farewell bards, until our next meeting!**Webster's dictionary defines a poem as, "A verbal composition designed to convey experiences, ideas, or emotions in a vivid and imaginative way, characterized by the use of language chosen for its sound and suggestive power and by the use of literary techniques such as meter, metaphor, and rhyme."  I think I can safely say all Bard GCs want you to write the very best, most evocative poem you possibly can.  You can always ask specific questions, of course, but here are some common ones I've encountered. Does a poem have to ryme?No, e. e. cummings made a career out of writing free-formed poems.  Note that his use of free form text added to the process of reading as opposed to making things confusing.  I don't expect the next e.e. cummings to be in this guild (but it would be grand if he was), but I also don't want too see those poems from the high school literary magazine with mindless line-breaks in an effort to be "deep."Do I have to follow a format (haiku, limerick, sonnet, etc.)?Again, no.  I used a Shakespearean sonnet for my poem because it made the writing process easier, it might be worth a try, but you don't have to do it.  Certain forms carry certain expectations, so be aware (although, as always with language, there are exceptions).  Limericks are generally ironic or funny and haikus remain one of the most difficult forms of verse.  Pick it if you want a challenge, not if you want to write the fewest number of words.What should I write my poem about?Something Bardic, which has a broad range of definitions.  Bards deal with music and language, so pretty much any emotion is fair game.  A poem about going to the store isn't too exciting, try to find something to fit the fantasy theme of Ryllian if you can.  Think big!  Think epic!  People still read Homer today because he wrote on a grand scale.Why did you spell rhyme "ryme" earlier?To see if you were paying attention.   :)**A lot has already been written on how important the story is in the life of a BardI won't repeat it all here, but I would tell you to read it all twice.  Here are a few things that make a good story:Stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Since space is a little tight here, these might be as short as a paragraph or two each, but they are important since a story should be a complete work.  Dropping a hero into an encounter with an Ogre without telling the reader who the hero is or why he's fighting the Ogre isn't really a story, it's a narrative.So what's a narrative?A narrative is pretty much what it sounds like, so give a description of events, generally in some sort of chronological order.  What separates a narrative from a story is a story has tramatic tension and characters (as opposed to actors, or people who wander through narrative accounts).So using the 3-section guideline for stories, we can think of them like this:Section 1:  Who's the main character?  What is the source of conflict (no conflict equals no drama--ever read a book in which everything always works out?).  How does the main character feel about the conflict?Section 2: The character confronts the conflict (or doesn't, which might itself spawn a new conflict).  For a lot of our stories this will be the "fight scene," but that's not a rule.  Feel free to get creative with how you use conflict in your story.Section 3: Resolution/Aftermath.  Did the character win?  What did it mean?  Was it a lasting victory or simply a small one?  Was any sort of internal struggle resolved (did killing his evil half-brother actually avenge the death of his fiance)?As a final note, another story archetype (that'*cough*As a final note, another story archetype, that's not really a story, is the ode.  An ode is basically writing about how great person X is and all the cool things they've done.  This is great, and it's something Bards should do a lot of, but it's not a story.  There's no tension, there's no plot that's advanced as it progresses, and it doesn't transport the reader in any way (except to awe them I suppose).**I have an odd idea...not sure if it is something that is useful or not, but here goes...today Rek killed my phoenix as i was idle in the green. i know, my fault thati sat idle for a few minutes, but at any rate...now i can't use myphoneix for 3 hours. i know it is a, for lack of a better word, "punishment" of sorts, but if someone kills our companion, i was thinkingmaybe the penalty could be shorter than if we got it killed in actualcombat. just a suggestion/question.ThanksAtrocity**In short, no.  I'm sorry that this seems harsh, butour companions are considerably stronger and havemore features than other guilds 'pets' have.  Thetrade off is that you must protect them with yourlife.  I see no difference between a player or amonster killing your companion, so I see no reasonthat they should have a shorter time peroid if aplayer does the deed.Your companion is a part of you.  Guard them withyour very life and they will do the same for youas well.-Reflex**Sometimes it is not the destination but the journey that is important in life------Unknown------Peace, Love and HappinessMoadeep the Minstrel**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**0**"
