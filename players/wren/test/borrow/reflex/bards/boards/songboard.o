maid I'll sing a song, Sing Rikkity-Tikkity-Tin,About a maid I'll sing a song, Who didn't have her family long,Not only did she do them wrong, She did every one of them in, them in,She did every one of them in.One morning in a fit of pique, Sing Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,One morning in a fit of pique, She drowned her father in the creek,The water tasted bad for a week, And we had to make do with gin, with gin,And we had to make do with gin.Her mother she could never stand, Sing Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,Her mother she could never stand, And so a cyanide soup she planned,Her mother died with a spoon in her hand, And her face in a hideous grin, a grin,And her face in a hideous grin.She set her sister's hair on fire, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,She set her sister's hair on fire, And as the smoke and flame rose higher,Danced around the funeral pyre, Playing a violin, o-lin,Playing a violin.She weighted her brother down with stones, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,She weighted her brother down with stones, And sent him off to Davy JonesAll they ever found were some bones, And occasional pieces of skin, of skin,And occasional pieces of skin. One day when she had nothing to do, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,One day when she had nothing to do, She cut her baby brother in two,And served him up as an Irish stew, And invited the neighbors in, bors in,and invited the neighbors in.And when at last the police came by, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,And when at last the police came by, Her little pranks she did not deny,To do so she would have had to lie, And lying she knew was a sin, a sin,And lying she knew was a sin.My tragic tale I will not prolong, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,My tragic tale I will not prolong, And if you do not enjoy my song,You've yourselves to blame if it's too long, You should never have let me begin, beginYou should never have let me begin.**See, my days are cold without youBut Im hurtin while Im with youAnd though my heart cant take no moreI cant keep runnin back to youSee, my days are cold without youBut Im hurtin while Im with youAnd though my heart cant take no moreI wont keep runnin back to youI think about my strength to finally get up and leaveNo more broken heart for meNo more tellin your lies to meIm lookin like I got my head on right, so now I seeNo more givin you everythingTheres no more takin my love from meSee, my days are cold without youBut Im hurtin while Im with youAnd though my heart cant take no moreI cant keep runnin back to youSee, my days are cold without youBut Im hurtin while Im with youAnd though my heart cant take no moreI wont keep runnin back to youIm glad to wake up every day without you on my brainNo more where youre laid up at nightNo more havin to fuss and fightIm proud to say that I will never make the samemistakeNo more thinkin bout what you doTheres no more me runnin back to youSee, my days are cold without youBut Im hurtin while Im with youAnd though my heart cant take no moreI cant keep runnin back to youSee, my days are cold without youBut Im hurtin while Im with youAnd though my heart cant take no moreI wont keep runnin back to youSome say the ex makes the sex spectacularMake me lick you from your neck to your backAnd youre shiverin, tongue deliverinChills up that spine, that a** is mineStick with wine and the candlelight, no CristaltonightIf its alright wit you we f***in (Thats cool)Dj vu, the blood spark, finger f***in in the parkThis is your Bacardi DarkRemember when I used to play between your legs, youbegged for me to stopBecause you know where it would head, straight to yourmothers bedNot the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spotNext to your sister, damn, I really missThe way she used to rub my back when I hit thatWay she used to giggle when your ask would wiggleNow I know youre used to suites at the Park orMeridianTrips to the Caribbean, but tonight no endsYou must be used to me cryin, cryinWhile youre out bumpin and grindinBut Im leavin you tonightSee, my days are cold without youBut Im hurtin while Im with youAnd though my heart cant take no moreI cant keep running back to youYou must be used to me cryin, cryinWhile youre out bumpin and grindinBut Im leavin you tonight**Where dips the rocky highlandOf Sleuth Wood in the lake,There lies a leafy islandWhere flapping herons wakeThe drowsy water rats.There we've hid our faery vatsFull of cherriesAnd of reddest stolen berries. Come away, O human childTo the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand;The world's more full of weeping than you can understand. Where the wand'ring water gushesFrom the hills above glen'Car,In pools among the rushesThat scarce could bathe a star,We seek for slumb'ring troutAnd, whispering in their ears,Give them unquiet dreamsFrom ferns that drop their tears. Come away, O human childTo the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand;The world's more full of weeping than you can understand. Away with us he's going,The solemn-eyed;He'll no more hear the lowingOf the cows on the warm hillside. For he comes, the human childTo the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand;The world's more full of weeping than he can understand. Words: WB YeatsTune: Kate Price**She, she really loves the simple thingsShe can't afford no diamond rings,And wouldn't wear them if she could.She hits me like a cool summer rainthen she's gone on the windBut I can hear her whisper in the woodsAnd I can see the oceanWhen I look into her eyesMy heart is swept awayLike a paper boat on the tideI'm destined to run aground, with her by my sideTogether we'll wake upto a watercolor sunriseShe, she's been running in the rainShe's like whiskey on my brainShe makes me feel so highShe, she's got holes in her stockingsNow she's up and unlocking the door for meAnd I can see the oceanWhen I look into her eyesMy heart is swept away Like a paper boat on the tideI'm destined to run aground, with her by my sideTogether we'll wake up, to a watercolor sunrise.No on really knows where she's from.She comes and she goes like a watercolor bleeds and runs awayWhat am I afraid of? Here she comes....She, she really loves the simple thingsCan't afford no diamond ringsAnd wouldn't wear them if she couldShe, she's got holes in her stockingsNow she's on the front porch rockingThe baby to sleep**How do I say goodbye to what we had? The good times that made us laugh Outweigh the bad. I thought we'd get to see forever But forever's gone away It's so hard to

But I tried.**We both lie silently still in the dead of the nightAlthough we both lie close togetherWe feel miles apart insideWas it something I said or something I didDid the words not come out rightThough I tried not to hurt youThough I triedBut I guess that's why they sayChorus:Every rose has its thornJust like every night has its dawnJust like every cowboy sings his sad, sad songEvery rose has its thornYeah it doesI listen to our favorite song playing on the radioHear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and easy goBut I wonder does he knowHas he ever felt like thisAnd I know that you'd be here somehow If I could have let you know somehowI guessChorusThough it's been a while nowI can still feel so much painLike a knife that cuts you the wound healsbut the scar, that scar remainsI know I could have saved a love that nightIf I'd known what to sayInstead of makin' loveWe both made our separate waysBut now I hear you found somebody newand that I never meant that much to youTo hear that tears me up insideAnd to see you cuts me like a knifeI guessChorus**Upon the darkened nightThe flame of love was burning in my breast.And by a lantern bright.I fled my house while all in quiet rest.Shrouded by the nightAnd by the secret stair I quickly fled.The veil concealed my eyes.While all within lay quiet as the dead.ChorusOh night thou was my guide.Oh night more loving than the rising sun.Oh night that joined the lover,To the beloved one.Transforming each of them into the other.Upon the misty night.In secrecy, beyond such mortal sight.Without a guide or light.Than that which burned so deeply in my heart.The fire 'twas led me on.And shined more bright than of the midday sun.To where he waited stillIt was a place where no one else could come.ChorusWithin my pounding heart.Which kept itself entirely for him.He fell into his sleep.Beneath the cedars all my love I gave.And by the fortress walls.The wind would brush his hair against his brow.And with its smoothest hand.Caressed my every sense it would allow.ChorusI lost myself to him.And laid my face upon my lover's breast.And care and grief grew dim.As in the morning's mist became the light.There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair.There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair.There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair.**I put myself in so many situationsSometimes it's just too much for me to dealAllow myself to be led aroundBy my heart and what I feelDrowning in a pool of sorrowLosing what is left of my poor mindBit's of shattered dreamsThat's all that's left cuase that's all I hadIt happened againI don't know where I went wrongIt'll happen againWhat did I do for a pain this longI'm not gonna sit hereListen to your liesDon't pretend you knowWhat it does to me insideEverythings not alrightI'm a fool to believeThat your websCaught up Around meI had no ideaToo afraid to askBrush away my tearsThis time was the last**	WildI go wild, cause you break me open wildcause you left me here...

wakesShe won't be thankful anymoreShe'll never know how much I caredJust that I couldn't stayAnd I'll never know the reasonWhy I always run awayChorus:Burning bridges one by oneWhat I'm doin' can't be undoneAnd I'm always hoping somedayI'm gonna stop this runnin' aroundBut every time the chance comes upAnother bridge goes downLast night we talked of old timesFamilies and home townsShe wondered if we'd both agreeOn where we'd settle downAnd I told her that we'd cross that bridgeWhenever it arrivedNow thorugh the flames I see herStandin' on the other sideRepeat ChorusLike ashes on the waterI drift away in sorrowKnowing that the dayMy lesson's finally learnedI'll be standing at a riverStaring out across tomorrowAnd the bridge I need to get thereWill be a bridge that I have burnedRepeat ChorusAnother bridge goes down**I want to feel that white hot fireBurnin' in my chest I need long cool wet kisses Who'd want to settle for less I don't

even if romance ran out of rhyme,You would still have my love until the end of time.You're all I need, my love, my valentine.All of my life I have been waiting for all you give to me.You've opened my eyes, and taught me how to love unselfishly.I've dreamed of this a thousand times before, But in my dreams I could not love you more.I will give you my heart until the end of time.You're all I need, my love, my valentine.And even if the sun refused to shine, even if romance ran out of rhyme,You would still have my heart until the end of time,'Cause all I need is you, my
