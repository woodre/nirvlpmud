  Somewhere between rogue and rake for much of his
  mortal existence, Reflex was, above all else,
  loyal to those he held dear.  Tempted by the call
  of evil or dedicated to the cause of good, Reflex
  strove for excellence in whatever task interested
  him at the moment.  Perhaps it was this dedication
  to style and grace that caused him to become
  interested in Bardic lore.  Regardless of the root
  cause, Reflex was distraught by the lack of style
  and beauty that accompanied much of the power on
  Nirvana.  

  A prophecy in the library of Ryllian read, "When
  Nirvana faces its darkest hour, the Bards will
  return."  Many scholars had assumed this meant
  some great invasion or the triumph of evil.  But,
  after the invasion of the goblin armies, they were
  forced to reevaluate their positions.  Reflex,
  perhaps alone, realized that the greatest threat
  to Nirvana was not physical, but rather aesthetic.
  For what use is conquest if it silences
  creativity?  What point to battle if there is no
  beauty worth fighting for?  Reflex understood
  these lessons and brought the Bards back to
  Nirvana, fulfilling the prophecy.
