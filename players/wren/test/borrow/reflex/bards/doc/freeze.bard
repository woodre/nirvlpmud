Suspend Bard

Rank: 10
Uses: freeze <player>
Mana: 0

This is the Guild Commander ability to temporarily 
suspend a Bard's abilities.  This is to be used when
a Bard commits a crime against the guild, or behaves
grossly out of charactor for a Bard.  Examples of this
would be participating directly in PK, arranging the
death of other players in other ways, partying with or
assisting agents of death(Shardak for example), or
other betrayals of the guild and its ideals.  This
ability is to be used soley at the discretion of the
Guild Commanders, and is temporary while a decision is
made about whether or not the Bard should remain in the
guild.
