Additional Bard Trials (continued)

Before you can do the trial for guild level 6 you
must write a song.  This can be one of your own
imagination(encouraged) or the lyrics to a favorite
song of yours.  You may submit this song in the 
music room in the northern end of the guild hall.
Once a Guild Commander has approved your song you
may proceed to take the trial for guild level 6.

Before you can do the trial for guild level 9 you
must write a story.  The story must be original and
needs to be about the history of Nirvana in some
way.  You can write about famous events, places, 
times, guilds or personalities, or even the Gods of
this land.  Submit your story in the writing room
at the northern end of the guild hall.  Once a Guild
Commander has approved your story, you may proceed
with the trial for guild level 9.
