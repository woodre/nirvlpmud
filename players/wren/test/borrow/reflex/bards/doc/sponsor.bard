Sponsor New Bards

Rank: 10
Uses: sponsor <player>
Mana: 0

Sponsor is used to bring a player into the Bard's 
guild.  Please make sure that there are no issues with
doing this(talk to your guildmates), and that the 
player realizes what it means to be a Bard.  Once this
is complete, have the player follow you to the lounge,
and there you may sponsor them.
