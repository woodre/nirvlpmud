Bard Songs

Bards are by both nature and definition musicians.
For a bard, music is friend and companion, lover and
master.  

To play a song, the bard must simply type:
sing <song #> <verse #> 

A list of songs, and their length and verses can be
found with by typing: sing

Because the songs have been divided into verses, a bard
my improvise on their performance.  For example, song
one <Hay nonny nonny> is divided into three parts, with
sections 1 and 3 being the verses and section 2 being
the chorus.  A proper rendition of the song would
therefore be section 1, section 2, section 3 and
section 2.  <You gotta end with the chorus, after all.>
However, if the bard desired, she could play sections 1
and 3 only, or repeat the chorus 2 times in a row.  One 
note of caution, wait for the first section to end
before beginning the second.  It is a good idea to
practice alone before playing in public.
