Bard Rules and Limitations.

1)  Bards do not player kill.
      Bards are not pkers.  Neither a bard nor their
      pet may attack a player, even in a pk zone.
2)  Bardic magic does not kill.
      No bard spell (with one exception) will ever
      kill a creature.  It is contrary to the nature
      of bardic magic to take a life.
3)  Bards must maintain a positive balance within
      their soul.  Bards are champions of noble
      causes.  Their abilities and gifts will not work
      if their soul is not balanced towards the light.
4)  Bards do NOT help other bards with bard trials.
      Bard trials serve in lue of donating xp for
      guild levels.  Help with these tasks removes the
      thinking aspect from these trials and destroys
      the system.  Helping with a bard trial (info,
      hints, ect...) is one of the few ways to get
      kick out of the guild.
