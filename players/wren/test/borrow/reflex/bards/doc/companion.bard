Companions

Those of the Bardic tradition may summon a companion 
to accompany them on their journeys.  Bardic 
companions are mentally linked to the summoner.  If a
Bard companion dies, the bard takes mental backlash.

Before you can summon a companion you must assign it
a name so that it may be summoned properly.  The 
<petname> command is used for this, type <lore
petname> for more information on this command.  Once
a companion is summoned you may freely switch between
your companions, as long as when you switch your 
current one is at full health.  Each companion has
its own skills and abilities, so some will be more
useful than others in certain situations.

  Type <lore faerie> for information on the Faerie.
  Type <lore brownie> for information on the Brownie.
  Type <lore phoenix> for information on the Phoenix.
