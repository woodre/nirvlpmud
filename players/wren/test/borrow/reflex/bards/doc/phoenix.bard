Phoenix

The legendary Phoenix is your most powerful ally in
combat.  The Phoenix will attack with strength and
skill, attempting to destroy all in its path.  However
as a result of its aggressive fighting style the 
Phoenix will get hurt during a fight, and if the Bard
does not watch out for their companion, the Phoenix
may get killed.  When you lose a companion in a fight
you are unable to summon that companion for several
hours, so be very careful.

Available commands for your Phoenix are:

talk/silence   Toggles on silent or noisy behaviour.
               Use: talk/silence.
sic            Will 'sic' your companion on a
               a creature.
               Use: sic <creature>
guard          Protects your companion from attack.
               Use: guard
bye            Dismisses your companion.
               Use: bye
munch          Allows your companion to chow down on
               a corpse.
