Cantrips

Cantrips are the only true magic that Bards
possess.  All other Bardic magic is based upon
their ability to shape the primal forces of law
and chaos to a more desireable reality.
Cantrips are pure, non-music based magic.

The Cantrips are as follows:

Cantrip: Bauble                   <lore bauble>
Cantrip: Intox                    <lore intox>
Cantrip: Bubble                   <lore bubble>
Cantrip: Storm                    <lore storm>
