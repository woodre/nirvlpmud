messages "We need to be updated(morningstar):**I realize that with Bern gone, Asmithrune can't be expected to do everything,however, our guild description in the new leaflet is really just embarrassingI think this guild is really fabulous and has a lot of potential, but it istrue that some of our powers, especially combat spells are a little outdated.How about raising the damage levels, or at least adding a higher piety spelllike Wrath of God or something? Perhaps a Peace spell or a special Clericstaff. I realize it would not be me doing the necessary coding and all, butdo need to need to be updated.Having finished raising my stats, I am currently gaining a lot of exp. Itwill become more and more costly to switch guilds over time, nor would Iwant to. However...Anyway I hope you'll all ask Asmithrune about it (politely!).**Hello all:)(asmithrune):**Hello fellow guild members,I am sorry that I haven't been in evidence lately, but I am currentlygoing through finals at my school, so have had No time.  AlsoI am going on break in about a week, so that means an absenceof a month.  I apologize for this.  However, over break, I willbe doing some planing for some new guild abilities and powers.  I hopethat you have the patience to stay with the guild for that time.  If youhave any ideas, post or mail them before 12/17/92.  Thank you.	-AsmithrunePS:  Thanks to Dritz and Morningstar for the ideas and suggestions. Keep them comming!**new command for helpers(dritz):**is it possible that you can send your helper to the storethe helper would trump to the shop or somethingthen you could control him as you normally wouldthen you could have him come back to you when he is done at the store**when(dritz):**when is there going to be some udating done to this guild????I give ideas but that is the farther it goes**Re: When(asmithrune):**In response to Dritz's note, and I am sure, alot of shared feelings, I offerthis.  I am a college student too, and I mud when I have time.  But sutdyingalways comes first.  I am also not the worlds greatest coder, I can doit, but it takes me a while.  I can only offer this as an excuse, andnot a solution.  I will do what I can to improve this guild, and asalways I apreciate and ideas, gripes, etc. that you may have.	-Asmithrune**simple commands for asmithrune(dritz):**can you make it so we can use the "tell" command at no costand can you make a room for each cleric <like the vamps coffin> just a room that we can call our own and invite non-clerics into to chat,and what not, that would have a discriptioncan you make it so we can tellaport to a roomby typing in the rooms discription in the who2 listingthank you again for your time asmithruneand could you do something about the Holy Hand Grenade, anything,?**ideas(dritz):**dear asmithrunea new spellspell of "angel of wrath"this spell would raise your wc to 20-40 depending on your real level'but you would have no armor class at all <even - armour>it would cost 200spyou would lose all your inv. exp for robes,coinsand you would only be able to pick up coinsalso "angel of protection"this would be the same as the angel of wrath but you would have no weapon classand you could only pick up coinsalso an phrase emoterwould emote but it wouldn't put the payers name who emoted**modification on the angel of wraith(dritz):**this spell would turn you into a weapon.the weapon would have a weapon class of twice your real levelthe weapon's weight would be set buy will power(sc2)the higher the will the less the weapon would weigh.this spell would cost 200 spthe caster would lose there inventory.'when the weapon breaks first:the person who was a sword loses half there hit pointssecond the person is trumped to the room where the person was wielding it wasthird the monster that the sword was hitting would start attacking that personthey would be able to talk,say,gossip...they would also see out of the wielder's eyes**help_others(nikkita):**I feel it's time for ANOTHER GOOD IDEA THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN BECAUSEASMITHRUNE IS TO BUSY TO DO SQUAT.now, I feel if we call ourselves clerics we should have spells to help us ACT LIKE CLERICS, but unfortunely our beloved guild-master has onlygiven us ONE spell that can heal anybody but ourselves, now to remember whata cleric is supposed to be. **A spirital leader who tends to other's needs**say now, wouldn't it be nice if when someone said 'Nikkita could could you hheal me?' that I could say yes.But  --- 1) I ain't spending my SP on some stranger (expecially 100SP)2) I can't even cast that stupid spell yet.therefor I think a new spell is a must  -- one like this --Name:  HealCost:  X SPLevel: 14Description: Heals another player by X*2 XP and costs that player X*1/2 SP             that way, if one of my higher level friends needs help, I'm            worth coming to (saving them in the SP to XP conversion)            and if I want to help a newbie I don't have to use a way            overpowered spell.  The other player would probably have to             give permission for the spell to take effect or something            It's just that I'm tired to turning down help to all these            people who ask me for help just because             my GUILD == CLERIC.and please, asmithrune, don't take that first part personally,I know your busy, but if you can't keep up, let someone else.**hoping for action**                                             Thanks in advance									                                                    TRDN**more_rambling(nikkita):**Modification of heal spell -after reconsidering for oh about 2 minutes or so I had somemore thoughtsabout my spurr-o-de-moment spell idea and other ramblings1) level 14 is way to high maybe more like 102) prehaps the spell should only cost a flat rate, say 40 or 502.5) if so, then make a max of say 100HP healed but still charge the other     player X/2 SP3) and though I didn't say it befor, of course that player would have to     be in the same room with youalso, anyother spell in the _instand_friend_maker_ theme would be nice too                                             Thanks in advance,                                                                         N**|\\\\\\\\\\ Mizan //////////|(nazim):**This is Mizan, I am using my test character to leave this message.	A recent wiz, i am hoping to help out the Cleric guild. I stronglywelcome any suggestions that any of you may have in making the guild better.None of my plans have as of yet been approved, since Persephone seeks tocode for this guild as well, and Bern has to be contacted before any changesare made.These are my ideas:	The guild will (hopefully) have a wide array of spells available, thisis not a touch up- i plan on creating a NEW guild in essence- there are tenlevels, with 1 million (gasp) exp required for level 10. Sounds like alotbut hopefully these are some of the spells being passed along:Examples of spells: (level 2) Knowledge: costs one sp per 3 combat rounds, andshows the percentage of HP remaining on the monster you are engaged in.(level 2) Concentration: puts you in a 'resting' state like on many othermuds, and accelerates healing.(level 3) Anastasia: calms the monster you are fighting down(stops fighting)(level 3) Rock: creates a bag of numbered stones you can use to prevent gettinglost when you are exploring dungeons, and only you can see it.(level 4) Spiral (ahh attack spell!) area attack, and grows in power as yougain in guild levels. (must be quested for)(level 9) divine intervention: resurrects dead players, and heals all presentin the room,can be cast in combat too, and casts multiple random area attackspells.Well.. I can go on and on, but i don't know if anyone out there can see this.Please, mail me- tell me you read this, and what you think.... and remember,nothing has been approved yet, and i am uncertain of my future with codingfor this guild- it lies in the hands of Bern, Sandman, and Persephone						Thank you,					 	-=mizan=-**please...(phoenix):**I hope someone reads this. . . I've been playing on nirvana for over 2 yearsnow, and this is my fourth guild. I started off as a doppleganger, thenchanged to an alchemist and got to level 8 (I killed hades) and thenchaanged to a mage and rose through all the levels in that guild. If I putall the experience I sunk into the mages guild into my levels I'd be level 20by now with various quests under my belt. I spent so much time andeffort collecting the mage scrolls and gaining experience for the mage guildNow it's all been taken away, and I have nothing to show for it, and Ihad no say in the matter. Worse, most of my friends have left nirvana.I just paid the experience to raise my piety from 8 to 20 again....I am not interested in gaining experience anymore. I'm very dissilusioned andweary and all I want to do is help people and hang out. Please don't change theclerics guild. While it's here at least I have some semblence of power toshow for my efforts, and I am not up for getting the 1million+ experience for the new guild. (unless you cn get experience for healing and ressurecting). I've already put at least a million exp in the guild I used to belong to,and I have nothing to show from it. I can't do it again. 					sincerely, phoenix**that nasty million(nazim):**I made some stuff clear with Phoenix already- please dont flame him, he has areason to be annoyed at the one million exp thing. I'd like to point out nowthat there are three wizzes fighting for this guild now. Nightshade has onecoded already (it seems) with a requirement of 1.5 million exps, and persephone wants to code as well.. we all knowI am proposing 1 mil exp for a max of level 10 because i hope to get a seriesof brutal offensive spells.... but the guild that i am coding stresses the defensive as well, since there are some excellent heal spells... whichare also designed to deal with the new environment of this mud.	thanks again,	|\\\\\\\\\\ Mizan //////////|ps Dont ask me what the |\\\\\/////| are for *grin* and if you want to know anything about the guild, feel free to mail me**one thing(phoenix):**Package... If you only had any idea how much time I spend deep in lagsearching the crescent lake, or damians keep, or merlyns realm...or any of the other places the scrolls were hidden instead of nuking students and lost soulslike my friends on the mud... you would understand.... I lost easily over a mil.I spent whole mud days for nothing.- Smiling yet somber, PhoenixPS- I resurrected a newbie today. I like the description! :)**hey!!!!!!(package):**ok i wanna know hows been removing my posts!!!!! um mebbeee not :)**Future of the Clerics guild...(psykosis):**	Ok.. we do have a future.. I have been talking to Boltar, and I thinkI might be able to gain control of this guild, and thus inprove it greatly!I have many new ideas up my sleave, and I think we can make this guild hoppingagain... But don't expect us to become another Dopple or Vamp guild. I willkeep our spells orginal.. and not fall into the everything guild trap (Likethe two above mensioned  muds... *grin*)...
