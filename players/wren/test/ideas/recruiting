Propossal.


Propossal.promotional team with display to go to big conventions
like GenCon and E3. Set up a closed booth that promisses the 
greatest in retro gaming. Have the addy posted up and the crew in
Nirvana address T-shirts. 

T-shirts in general. Nirvana shirts that could be sold on site with
some sort of graphic, a text log, and the web addy prominently displayed.

Could have photo contest for best high profile displaying of it. 


These would likely get us several new hits at least.
