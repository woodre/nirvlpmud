Alrighty enough of this bullshit. We're going to settle a few points right off.

1. I am not Mizan. No shit. But since he isn't here and no one else jumped into 
                   the job, I'm what you get. My mission is unchanged. I intend
                   to keep the guild running to the best of my ability. No big   
                   additions or radical changes planned. Just smoothing edges.

2. I am the acting Guild Wizard. I do have the authority to do the stuff I am 
       doing. I don't change anything more than typos and minor function stuff
       without clearing it with a higher up in the chain of command first. Hell
       I even usually clear the typos with them first too.

3. Order of Loyalty.
	A> To thine Own self be true...
              We are allowed to be individuals here. And much like in
              the USA you can be as much of an individual as you want 
              so long as you aren't stepping on someone elses rights 
              to do the same. And also being individuals means taking 
              responsibilty for our own actions. 
                        

	B> To POLYMORPH GUILD...
              Shouldn't need to be stated. This guild had a family like 
              atmosphere. You don't have to like everyone but you are 
              to get along with each other or at minimum tolerate each
              other without being assholes. And help each other out 
              when the oppotunity arises. It also means not dragging 
              the guild into personal conflicts. If you do something 
              that vexes someone else its between you and them; if you 
              piss off another guild, its you versus them.

	C> Alliances and Friends...
              This shouldn't have been a big issue but its ballooned.
              You are allowed to associate with whoever you want at 
              present, but it vexes me to see polys told they can't 
              associate with each other because of the company they 
              keep outside the guild. See point B again if you don't 
              know what i want. Also, you are still expected to follow
              all the rules of the guild and those that spuck laid out 
              at joining; if an alliance wants you to break or bend 
              any of those as part of membership you probably shouldn't 
              join that group.

4. Player Killing.
	This is still forbidden as it has been for the longest time. There
        is no hard code at present forcibly blocking it. There used to be
        but several polys, my self included spent a lot of time arguing 
        to get the limits reduced due to the high number of pk areas in 
        general that we couldn't go anywhere near. A lot of popular areas
        would not have been accessible now. However just because we can 
        enter the area doesn't mean we are to go linger and try to get 
        jumped so we can try to pk. You are allowed to keep form and 
        flee. Earlier penalties included loss of form, which as you 
        know could have lead to loosing weapons and having to wait for 
        the timer to run down before morphing to that form again. I'm 
        pretty sure no one wants that back. So please, I don't want to 
        see any attempts to kill people.  
            
5. GC's. 
        In the past we've usually had two active GC's. Aiden and Oolabob.
        Trpsprngr and myself. I went and got promoted and left an opening.
        I decided to offer the job to summer. She had expressed an interest
        in the position and demonstrated the right knowledge of the guild. 
        No other candidates leapt out as being interested or ready for it.
        She also has been one of the only polys pointing out bugs and spots 
        that I needed to work on. I work much better with constructive 
        comments and presented ideas then on reacting to complaints and 
        bitching. So, if she wants to keep the title its hers. If you guys 
        have been jerks enough that she wants to resign the commission I'll 
        restore her pervious level. If you pressure the decision (ala violate
        point 2B) I'll bounce you from the guild.

6. BUGs and Ideas.
        Several times I have asked what needed worked on and I've gotten very 
        few useful comments. I usually get complaints about the timers. Which
        were put in by Mizan so they are going to stay a part of life. Verte
        was kinda enough to do some adjusting to them when he noticed they were
        not following the values that they were supposed to. This is in your 
        favor by the way. He also reduced the death delay in multi-limb so 
        monsters wouldn't hang at death for as long as they used to. Wizards
        try to make things fun, but we have to be a bit detached to do this job
        so we really do rely on feedback to know what has broken and what 
        just doesn't work. If something really needs worked on mail me with 
        as much description of the problem as you can and I'll look into it.

7. Guild wars. 
        These won't happen. We are Switzerland. Just as Mizan outlined in several
        places, we are nuetral. Only pk guilds really have sides in the good 
        evil battler here. Individual polys may choose to be more good or bad
        but their views are not those of the entire group. So no organizing 
        attacks on other guilds. I didn't want to have to outline this but it
        does appear to have to be dealt with thanks to the complaints of an 
        outside guild. 
        
        NO killing GUILD NPC's. I will now outline this further so there will be
                                no confusion on this point. I mean do not participate
                                in the killing of critters that are important to other 
                                guilds. We would be pissed if they came after Spuck, 
                                we can extend the same courtesy that we would want from 
                                them. This includes but may not be limited to Shardak, 
                                Necromantic Guardian, Templar Guards, Power Rangers, and 
                                any new ones that may pop up or that I'm not thinking of
                                yet. I know they are often worth a lot of xp, that usually 
                                means they were meant to be extremely hard to kill. 
                                Players are stronger now and rewards are greater with 
                                the new xp formulas where before they wouldn't have been
                                worth the challenge. Unless someone has a better suggestion
                                this policy goes into effect immediately.
                                

I didn't want to have to spell out all of this. We have too much selective reading between 
the lines of rules here. All Mizan's policys are still in effect. I'm not really changing
anything I'm just being really specific since so many of you want to challenge things. I
am trying not to favor anyone in this guild and frankly I'm about ready to retire. 
I volunteered to take on this job because I was getting tired of seeing a lot of wizards 
talking about cutting out old code and old guilds to make room for their stuff. I always 
felt at home in the polys and didn't want them to go away. I will continue to keep them
going for as long as I am allowed to. I will be straight with you guys the way Mizan was.
Just don't try to push me into any corners or take advantage of my generosity. I often have
a better idea of whats going on than you think. I'm done now. This should cover all the 
crap that came to my attention today. Really though, common sense folks. Later
