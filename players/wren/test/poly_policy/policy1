Alrighty enough of this bullshit. We're going to settle a few points right off.

1. I am not Mizan. No shit. But since he isn't here and no one else jumped into 
                   the job, I'm what you get. My mission is unchanged. I intend
                   to keep the guild running to the best of my ability. No big   
                   additions or radical changes planned. Just smoothing edges.

2. I am the acting Guild Wizard. I do have the authority to do the stuff I am 
       doing. I don't change anything more than typos and minor function stuff
       without clearing it with a higher up in the chain of command first. Hell
       I even usually clear the typos with them first too.

3. Order of Loyalty.
	A> To thine Own self be true...
              We are allowed to be individuals here. And much like in
              the USA you can be as much of an individual as you want 
              so long as you aren't stepping on someone elses rights 
              to do the same. And also being individuals means taking 
              responsibilty for our own actions. 
                        

	B> To POLYMORPH GUILD...
              Shouldn't need to be stated. This guild had a family like 
              atmosphere. You don't have to like everyone but you are 
              to get along with each other or at minimum tolerate each
              other without being assholes. And help each other out 
              when the oppotunity arises. It also means not dragging 
              the guild into personal conflicts. If you do something 
              that vexes someone else its between you and them; if you 
              piss off another guild, its you versus them.

	C> Alliances and Friends...
              This shouldn't have been a big issue but its ballooned.
              You are allowed to associate with whoever you want at 
              present, but it vexes me to see polys told they can't 
              associate with each other because of the company they 
              keep outside the guild. See point B again if you don't 
              know what i want. Also, you are still expected to follow
              all the rules of the guild and those that spuck laid out 
              at joining; if an alliance wants you to break or bend 
              any of those as part of membership you probably shouldn't 
              join that group.
