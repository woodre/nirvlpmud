Syntax:    cp <file path> <new path>

Desc:
           This command copies file to another location without 
           changing the original. Useful for making second copies
           of a file for altering and testing alternate versions of
           an object. File name can also be changed.

Warning:   Remember to observe proper etiquette and credit sources 
           when borrowing code from other wizards. 

Example:   cp /players/bob/turkey.c /players/bob/food/turkey2.c
                  results
           file turkey is copied into .../food/turkey2.c and given
           a different file name.
