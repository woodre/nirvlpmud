                     Force

Syntax:    force <player> <action>

Desc:
           This command is useful for quickly getting a player to do
           what you need them to do. Be it save or register or drop 
           something you told them they weren't supposed to have. 
           Force allows you to use any command that the player can 
           use as though you were that player.

Warning:   Players don't take kinda to you taking away their illusion
           of control so running too many commands for them will draw
           complaints.

Example:   force mike sc
                  results 
           Mike is told he is forced to 'sc' and then sees his score
