                     Fix_guild

Syntax:    fix_guild <name>

Desc:
           This command clears a player's guild stats and name. 
           Especially useful for fixing test characters and guild
           work.

Warning:   Don't use on players, many guilds files are tricky to 
           restore do to closed directories and variables.

Example:   fix_guild mike
                  results
           Bob resets Mikes guild name to None and clears guild stats
