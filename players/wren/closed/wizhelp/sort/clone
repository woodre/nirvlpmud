Syntax:    clone <file>

Desc:
           This command creates the object from the file specified.
           One of a wizards most used commands. If in the directory 
           you only need to type the name else you can clone from 
           any directory from full path name. Objects appear in your 
           inventory, monsters in your immediate environment.

Warning:   When testing do not clone monsters in player areas. Also 
           be aware that players will see a message when you clone 
           objects and will often look at you to see what you are 
           doing.

Example:   clone /obj/bag.c
                  results 
           a bag is cloned into your inventory
           if you were in the /obj directory you could also simply 
           clone bag.c for same effect
