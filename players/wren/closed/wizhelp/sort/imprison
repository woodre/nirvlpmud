                     Imprison

Syntax:    imprison <player> <reason>

Desc:
           This command is used to put the extremely unrulely player 
           out of everyones way. The offender will not be able to 
           message out and will lose inventory items that might 
           facilitate escape. Wizards can also be imprisoned.
           The string reason is why you put the person in there and 
           should be detailed so other wizards know why the player
           is there.

Warning:   Not to be used on casual problems. Try to sort out the 
           issues and mainly stick unruly players here. Do not zap,
           dest, or force problem players. Lock the player in here
           to cool off. Should set a sentence so other wizards know
           how long they are supposed to remain in prison.

Example:   imprison bob
                     result
           Player Bob is put in room prison.
