                     Castle

Syntax:    castle <wizard name>

Desc:
           This command moves you to the castle of the wizard you 
           input. Useful if you are wanting to find where it is.

Warning:   Many castles aren't set up with commands and this places
           you inside of the castle object. Also if the castle isn't 
           set to load yet you may clone it. Be careful to not open 
           a castle to players that isn't approved yet.

Example:   castle bob
                  results
           moves you to Castle Bob
