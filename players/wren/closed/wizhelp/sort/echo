                     Echo

Syntax:    echo <msg>

Desc:
	   This ability is primarily for entertainment. Function like
	   an emote but doesn't attach the name of the user allowing 
 	   thematic messages or special effects. It displays to 
           current environment of user. Available at lvl 40.

Warnings:  Tempting to use to harass players. Can be amusing
	   to have player appear to be doing any action that
           comes to mind. Not good for happy players and goes
           against rules of minimum wiz/player interaction to 
           use overmuch.

Example:   echo A gust of wind swirls through the room.
                  displays
	   "A gust of wind swirls through the room."
                  to anyone in the same room.
