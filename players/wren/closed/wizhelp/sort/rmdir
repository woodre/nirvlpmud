                     Rmdir

Syntax:    rmdir <dir>

Desc:
           This command removes a directory. It only works on an 
           empty directory which reduces some of your chance of 
           removing an active directory.

Warning:   Always becareful deleting if you don't have good offline 
           backups.

Example:   rmdir blech
                  results
           directory blech if containing files is gone
