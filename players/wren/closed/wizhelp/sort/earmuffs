                     Earmuffs

Syntax:    earmuffs <on/off>

Desc:
           Earmuffs command blocks hearing all of the public channels
           as listed under "channels". Namely gossip, equip, shout, 
           risque, junk, msg, babble, newbie, pk, annouce, wiz, cwiz.

Warning:   You won't be able to hear players including calls for 
           assistance. Good way to zone out and code in peace though.

                  results
           Bob will no longer hear any messages over the public channels
