                     Light

Syntax:    light <on/off>

Desc:
           This command activates makes you into a light source so 
           that you can see in dark environments. It toggles without
           a message so if you had them on you'll need to toggle them
           off again manually.

Warning:   Several guilds are light sensitive. Please be aware of 
           your light levels before jumping into public areas and
           do not intentionally harrass these players.

Example:   light on
                  results
           Bob will be lit so that he can see in the dark room
           light off returns him to emitting no additional light.
