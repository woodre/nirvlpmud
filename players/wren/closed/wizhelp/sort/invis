                     Invis

Syntax:    invis <#>

Desc:
           This is the improved wizard invisiblity power. It doesn't
           wear off like the player version by movement and improves
           with your advancing levels. At lvl 30 player tells still 
           get through and you are not yet masked as "Someone". You 
           can intentionally set your invis lower to allow players 
           above that level to see you. It can't be set higher than
           your current level and not giving a number will result in
           max level by default.

Warning:   Without your wiz_tell you won't be able to talk while 
           invis. Until you get closer to lvl 40 you'll be fairly 
           noticable to players when moving. In your workroom a bit
           less so.

Example:   invis 15
                  results 
           Bob is basically invisible to players under 15. They'll 
           still see movement messages and be able to look at him
           if they know the name or have seen him talking.
