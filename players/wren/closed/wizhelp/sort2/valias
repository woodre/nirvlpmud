                     Valias

Syntax:    valias <player>

Desc:
           This command will show you all the commands a player has 
           aliases. It is helpful for debugging when a player says
           they can't move. Check to see that they didn't alias
           a movement command to something else.

Warning:   

Example:   valias mike
                  results
           all of mike's aliases are displayed
