The critical objects in the polymorphs and their responsibilities are as follows:

PDM.c
The Polymorph Daemon Master. This is the server object where all of the core guild
functionality resides. 

gob.c
The guild object. The guild object acts mostly as a variable container, and a function
router to the PDM, where a single copy of all guild functionality resides.

mob.c
The morph object template. This object is what the morph forms inherit from, building
their functionality from a base of common functions. Similar in interaction and
design to game objects such as /obj/living.c or /obj/monster.c

rsob.c
The remote spell object. This is used for casting spells that are of duration, instead
of the instant command line spells that require an input, generate an output, and
return. This is used when a spell needs to do callouts and lasts more than one
instant.

Other important files:

tugDM.c
The tug-pull daemon. This is the server object used for the tug and push statistics
functionality associated with ~/etheriel/ROOMS/linna.c

NEWSFILE.o
The stored object file used by the news system currently resident in PDM.c
