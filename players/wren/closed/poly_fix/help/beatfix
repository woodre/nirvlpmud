[BEATFIX]

  Usage:  beatfix

Beatfix does many things. It wakes up your heart beat if you get a weapons
error, wakes up the guild and morph objects, and resets the player object
just like 'register' in the clinic does. Therefore, if you feel that you
cannot carry anything when you should, or if your player stats are suddenly
messed up use this powerful function at will. Once should do it.
