[SPUCKTROOPER] Level [5] 120 charges (+sta, -int, -mag, ++str, -ste, +luck)

  If the capable Spuckball was a footsoldier in the Legion of Spuck,
  being a Spucktrooper is the equivalent of a captain :) An odd creature,
  a close relation to the Spuckball, and made of the same amorphous
  material 'Spuck-stuff', Spucktroopers are very well rounded, capable
  of everything the Spuckball was, and more.

  
>>-------------------------------ABILITIES-------------------------------<<

gobble <item>    Gobble up an item that is lying around in the room.
                 You dont really eat it or anything, it just winds up
                 inside you. A Spucktrooper can carry a truly ludicrous
                 amount of items.

spew <item>      Spit back out something that you gobbled earlier.

squit <monster>  (45 sps) An offensive spell, uses your mass in a most
                 efficient manner, to push your enemies around.

hwarf <item>     (variable cost) Hwarf basically hurls an item that
                 you have previously gobbled up at a monster that you
                 are currently fighting.

bletch <amount>  (max 130) Bletching is an area attack ability, not to
                  be taken lightly by any means. In any case, the bletch
                  ability is highly regarded among Spucktroopers, who
                  pride themselves with skillful and focused bletching,
                  and bystanders who are lucky enough to see a 'trooper
                  bletch will never forget it.
