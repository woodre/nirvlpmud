>> PLAYER KILLING


  Player Killing is a touchy subject. Here is the deal:

  If you have set your player killing (PK) flag, you will NOT be able to
  polymorph into other forms. The Guild does not frown on this but you
  will not be able to polymorph.

  Player killers are not able to attack non-player killers unless they are
  in an open PK area. An area like this is where any player can engage in
  PK combat regardless of whether or not their flag is set.

  Polymorphs are NOT ABLE to start PK fights whether their PK flag is
  set or not.

  Polymorphs ARE ABLE to participiate in PK fights if they are ATTACKED by
  an opposing player.

  Polymorphs will NOT revert to human form if attacked by a player in PK
  combat under any circumstances. This indeed used to be the case.
  
  Player killing within the guild will not be tolerated. If you have a
  problem with someone else in the guild find another way to resolve it.
  Dual consentual combat is allowed, but everything that you had to
  agree to upon joining the guild from Spuck is still in effect.

  Player killing other members of the guild is a sure way to get expelled
  from the guild. Such incidents are handled on a case by case basis.

  The Guild officially does not endorse nor condemn the art of PK, we
  are officially neutral to it, bordering on pacifism as we cannot 
  actually engage other players in combat unless they attack.
