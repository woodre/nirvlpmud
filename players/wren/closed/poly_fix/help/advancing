>> ADVANCEMENT, RAISING and REJOINING the guild...

Obviously, you have found Spuck if you are reading this, but
if you don't know how to get to him, you can access him from the guild
room (linna) or use the 'ether' ability (ether spuck).
Actually, the commands in the jello can be used to locate him,
such as the 'thinkto' and 'wormhole' commands.

Spuck is the 'official helper' of the guild, the large, happy amorphous
mass that he is. You must seek him out if you want to 'advance' in
the guild, or 'raise' one of your stats. If you somehow lose your
guild object (the lump of clay) you can get a new one from him by
typing 'join' again. Don't worry, you won't reset your levels or
anything.

It would not be wise to attack Spuck, or anything foolish along those
lines. He has executive control over who joins the guild and who
can leave. Also, Spuck has a voracious appetite for objects but
have no fear, he will not absorb fellow Polymorphs.
