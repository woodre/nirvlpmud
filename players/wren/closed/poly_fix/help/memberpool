>> MEMBER POOL

   I dont care who joins this guild. Polymorphs are an equal
   opportunity enrollment, and the only people who I won't let
   in are constant game troublemakers, but they know who they
   are. There will be no close doored policy at any point to
   restrict people from joining the guild. If anyone has a
   problem with it, please mail me an explanation of why we
   should limit guild expansion.

   So far there have been people who do not agree with a total
   open door policy but i have yet to hear any compelling reasons
   why. Mail me, if so. Conversely, if certain newbies have been
   troublemakers I was not informed about it. If there was no
   warning to me then of course I will assume nothing is wrong
   that could not be handled by you guys yourselves.

   This also works inversely as well. Anyone can be booted out
   of the guild for breaking any of the rules Spuck laid out
   when you joined.
