[REPLICANT] Level [4] 500 charges (+sta, +int, +mag, +str, +ste, +luck)

            (limited lifespan)

  Faster, stronger, more durable, and generally superior to humans
  in any physical respect, replicants are a most powerful type indeed.
  Almost impossible to distinguish from the general populace of the mud,
  they are genetically improved copies of the 'stock' creatures they
  are modeled upon.

  As for their intelligence, they have the potential to best humankind,
  except a built in and supposedly irreversible feature of their
  superbly enhanced physique is a drastically shortened lifetime.
  This improvement in intelligence directly increases spellcasting
  ability for the game standard attack spells.


>> Replicants can use all of the basic guild powers.

   They have no additional special powers.
