You must find Spuck to 'advance' or to 'raise' an attribute.
Syntax is similar to the adventurer's guild, e.g. 'raise stamina',
but abbreviations are used instead: 'raise sta'


ste = stealth       How agile you are in combat, able to dodge hits.
str = strength      Your strength. You can carry more things.
sta = stamina       Your constitution. The more you have the better.
int = intelligence  Affects your ability to cast spells, and do damage.
wil = will power    Determines the success ratio of guild spells. (like int)
luc = luck          Go figure. Used in many applications.
pie = piety         Used in the guild on occasion like luck and COMBAT!!
mag = magic aptitude  Your magic constitution. The more you have, the better

dex = dexterity     Not in use by the guild at this time, may be later update
cha = charisma


Attributes are slightly more expensive than what the player help file
'help attribs' otherwise states.


Attributes cost 3000 EXP per point when raising them between 1 and 12.
Attributes cost 4500 EXP per point when raising them between 13 and 16.
Attributes cost 6000 EXP per point when raising them between 17 and 20.

Attributes approximate those of 'help attribs' for raising between 20 and 30.
