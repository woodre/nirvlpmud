[POLYMORPH]


  Without arguments, displays a brief listing of polymorphs available.
  Otherwise, lets you assume the shape and powers of given polymorph
  or displays relevant polymorph information.


  NOTE: As of 07 OCT 2001 some changes will be implemented:

  ** There is a limit of how many times you can assume a morph form within
  a 24 hour day. The day is determined by the game clock.

  ** There is also a 'lag time' between forms. You must wait a certain
  time period between forms. For example, if Tetrapod has a 30 minute
  lag period, and you had just assumed the form of a Tetrapod you must wait
  30 minutes before being allowed to assume the form again.

  ** All of this information is displayed with the 'polymorph chart'
  command.


Usage: polymorph <form>




Alternate usage:


  polymorph history      Shows a listing of all recent morph changes.

  polymorph chart        Shows the listing of how many times you can
                         assume a morph form as well as the time that
                         you must wait before assuming them.


Type 'info forms' to see a listing of all available polymorph forms.
