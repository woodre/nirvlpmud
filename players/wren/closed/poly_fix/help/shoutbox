[SHOUTBOX] Level [4] 440 charges (-sta, -int, ++mag, ++str, --ste, --luck)
           (cannot wear armors: too constricting on the lungs)

  A shoutbox has the ability to produce a bewildering variety of sounds,
  from a shrill whistle beyond the range of any animal's hearing, to
  the potentially destructive, earthquake-like sub-bass.
