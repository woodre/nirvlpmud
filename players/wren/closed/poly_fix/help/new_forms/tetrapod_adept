[TETRAPOD ADEPT] Level [9] 2000 charges 
                                (++sta, --int, --mag, +str, ++ste, ++luck)

  Dark Tetrapods, like their smaller cousins are capable of wielding four
  weapons at once, but have the added gift of training in the dark arts
  of magic. Capable of casting a limited array of spells, they are much
  feared and well on their way of become adepts in both fighting and the
  dark spell arts.

>>-------------------------------ABILITIES-------------------------------<<

strap <weapon>   Wield a second weapon offhand.

strap all        Same as above but cycles through inventory and straps
                 weapons on a first-come, first-serve basis.

unstrap <weapon> Remove a weapon wielded offhand.

blitz            (60 sps) Charge whatever you are fighting and hopefully land
                 as many hard hits as possible in one combat round.

raar <sp>        (variable, or automatic by default) Regenerate
                 hp to sp on a 2sp : 1 hp heal ratio.

sonic <monster>  Dark Tetrapods are not completely ignorant of magic but for
                 the most part they are. If you are capable of casting the
                 game spell sonic, it will work for the most part here.

vigor <sp>       Vigor restores physical hitpoints directly from charges
                 stored within the clay. Be aware that the conversion rate
                 is not entirely efficient, and that energy transfer of this
                 sort has some reliability issues.

cloak            (50 sps) Cloaking hides the player from the outside world.
                 While cloaked you can conduct your own regneration or other
                 business without the nosy world probing in on you. Cloak can
                 be cast during combat but will cost higher (75 sps).

decloak          Return from cloaking in the shadows to the surface world.
