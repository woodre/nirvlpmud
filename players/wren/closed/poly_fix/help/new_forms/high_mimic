[HIGH MIMIC] Level [7] 75 charges (stats unchanged, no weapons, no armor)

  By taking the form of a mimic, you can imitate the likenesses of objects
  that are in your inventory or in your immediate environment. Of course
  you will not be able to imitate other players, but pretty much anything
  else goes. Please note that you will be able to "say" and perform limited
  emotes not any of the game standard emotes such as "grin" and "kick".
  REPEAT - EMOTES DO NOTHING!
  
  The high mimic has a better chance of avoiding detection, and again has
  the ability to perform a limited type of emote.
