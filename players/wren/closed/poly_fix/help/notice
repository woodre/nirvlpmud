Okay, effective immediately:

1) All polymorphs are BANNED from any PK incursion on ANY form
   whatsoever. No defensive PK combat, no aggressive PK combat.
   Participation of offensive expeditions is strictly banned.
   Direct physical involvement with the death of another
   player will be punishable via swift and painful means.

2) Travelling of PK zones is now strictly PROHIBITED. This is
   currently via honor system but if I hear more complaints, i
   have the will and the resources to implements _hard code_
   blocks. In summary, you will regard PK zones as territories
   similar to Libya, Cuba, and North Korea if you are an
   American citizen. You have _absolutely no business_ being
   there for any reason whatsoever. Commerce, diplomacy, etc
   NO REASON WHATSOEVER. No excuses.

3) Spamming of players of any form is strictly prohibited.
   By this i mean definable actions performed against the will
   of the recipient repeatedly and in a hostile or malicious
   manner. One of the things I coded into the polymorph kernel
   was spam detection, I never thought I would actually have
   to use it. IF YOU DO IT YOU WILL GET CAUGHT.

I regret the hostile and otherwise offensive tone of this note.
Unfortunately things have gotten out of hand here, caused by
a small minority of people and I will not let childish or
baiting behavior ruin what has otherwise been a superb guild
culture. I hope I will never have to do this again. Do not
question this policy. Do not place yourself above another guild
member. We are all equals here but since I coded this thing,
I am going to drop the hammer now!
