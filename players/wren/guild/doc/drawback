Drawback idea

Hidden guild wide stat

    Visibility:  Lots of magic use draws attention of the evil forces that 
                 have been seeking to destroy the Artificers. If the score
                 gets too high random chance of the baddies sending some
                 thing to investigate. If at critical level guaranteed 
                 arrival of big opponent.

                 Sliding scale similar to player alignment but driven by 
                 actions of whole guild. Saved as a variable in the guild 
                 hall. Partially viewable by council and GC's much like 
                 weapon qualities as in "Low" "Medium" "High" "Dangerous"
                 but no specific values.

                 Guild wizards can raise/lower if necessary. But shouldn't 
                 tamper too much for balance sake.

                 Random monsters check level to prevent newbie slaying 
                 following a busy reboot. The monsters will appear and 
                 seek guild members outside guild hall. Will fight back
                 if attacked by nonguild but tend to wander off in search
                 of true quarry. Players can hide in guild hall but no
                 caravans will arrive and exiting the hall will draw attacks.

                 Visibility reduces over time if high magics aren't being cast 
                 and if the monsters have been slain that were investigating.
