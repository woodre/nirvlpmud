CONCEPT FOR SIGILISTS TO GAIN SPELLS (Lesser Sigils)

NOTE: The files shown as examples are very crude and
were just thrown together as a proof-of-concept.

Step 1: The player must defeat a mob or solve a mini-quest
to attain an item. In this example, the item is a bone.
See /players/cosmo/guild/sigil/obj/bone.c

Step 2: The player must take the item back to his personal
Sigilist library room.
See /players/cosmo/guild/sigil/room/library.c

Step 3: The player must figure out something to do with the
item. In this case, the player must crack the bone in half.
If the player isn't in the library, the item is destroyed
and the player doesn't gain the knowledge. If the player is
in the room, then the player gains the spell.

In this example, the player learns the "disperse" spell,
which is for gaining power from and destroying corpses.
See /players/cosmo/guild/sigil/power/disperse.h

The gained spell is added to the spelllist array in the gob.
This array is checked by init() and the player gets a
command for each spell.
See /players/cosmo/guild/sigil/gobdir/vars.h
                                   ../init.h
                                   ../functions.h

Step 4: "Solving" the item also adds a book to the player's
library. Each book contains the help file for the new spell
that has been learned.

This is all pretty rough, but at least it's headed in some
direction. Let me know what you think and we'll build on it.
