Invoke is the generic name of the main Sigil attack spell. The actual
command corresponds to the major sigil that you have chosen.

Major sigil       Usage
-----------       -----
Fire              fire or fi
Ice               ice or ic
Electricity       electricity or el

The power of the sigil can be adjusted by using set_power. Greater
power will cost more spell points.
