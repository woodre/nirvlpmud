    Hi Cosmo,
Here's what i've got:

** Hey Languilen,
** I've embedded all of my comments with double asterisks.
** Cosmo
_________________________________________________________________________________
THEME:
     The guild is centered around the 1920's Capone era gangsters.  The
Guild should be role-played, it's abilities and structure are designed to
facilitate and possibly even necessitate active role-play.  Within the
Mob power and prestige is gained with graft money.

** This is much more well-defined than my theme.  I was thinking more along
** the lines of 1990s gangs, but I actually like this theme much better.
** I'm not real clear of the role that graft money would play in the guild,
** but I'm sure you can explain your thoughts on that.

ABILITIES:
     Eyeball-   Estimates opponants AC, WC, Carry and coins.
** Eyeball is basically the same thing I was thinking of for 'spy'.
     Extort-    Extortion of a movement direction or a player.
** I don't really understand what you mean by extorting a movement direction
     Blackmail- Blackmail a player.
     Concrete - Concrete shoes.  Stops a player/mons from leaving (timed)
** I like these two abilities!  Maybe there could be a guild shop which sells
** items that have to used to perform certain abilities.  In this case, the
** player would have to buy (and carry) a sack of concrete in order to use it.

I can't see a 1920's mobster throwing a magic missile so..
     Replace mud spells with guild-wep attack?
     Butt <target> - Smashes target with the butt of the thomson.
     Spray         - Sends a burst of 45 rounds.
     Or alternatively, be creative..
     Brass Knuckles/mi -
     Molitov Coctail/fi -
     Spray/so -
     etc..
** I like the idea of replacing mud spells with these attack abilities.  That's
** the same thing I had in mind with things like intimidate, assault, backstab,
** strangle, sharpshoot, execute (this one would be a finishing move of sorts).
** We can decide which ones we like the best, or just use all of them.  Gangbang
** and drive_by were also meant to be attack abilities, but only when in groups.

INNER GUILD ABILITIES:
     These abilities are mainly for use to facilitate role-play and the
mechanics of the guild.  The are gained not through guild level but by
the accumulated graft of the mobster.
     ice: puts a mobster 'on ice' preventing him/her from using most
          guild powers.
     contract: Offers a specific amount of graft for the death of a target
     contracts: Shows a list of current open contracts.
     plate: puts a plate on the table for any family member.
     feast: Fills a table at the family resturant full of food/drink :)
     account: Shows the Boss an accounting of the families graft.
** These are great!  I'm not sure I totally understand how plate and feast would
** work - sounds like some sort of healing ability.  Ice and contracts are really
** great ideas.

GUILD WEAPON:
     The Thomson sub-machine gun.  AKA tommy gun.  Takes a drum
magazine of 45 caliber shells guaranteed to rip the guts out of
anyone dumb enough to get in the way!
** After reading /doc/build/RULES/GUILD_WEAPON, I'm assuming that you are thinking
** of this as a non-exclusive weapon.  I would think that guild members should be
** able to use other weapons as well, and maybe get bonuses for using knives or
** any other gun.  Also, in order to give the weapon a greater damage potential,
** a random error could be built in for possible misfire/backfire/ammo jam.

GUILD PET:
     The guilds pet will take the form of a street punk.  a 'runner'
for the mobster.  He will not take part in combat.  Used to send
things to ppl and to carry stuff. (bagman).
** I hadn't considered this, but it sounds good.  Sounds very similar to the
** Vampire servants and could probably be coded in the same way.

GUILD HIERARCHY:
     Success in the Mob is measured in two parts, the common guild
leveland the inner organizational 'title'.
     Guild levels are raised through the trade of graft and exp while
the mobsters title is is determined by a graft payment, availability
and the word of the Godfather/Don/Leiutenant respectively.
     Example guild levels are: Bullie, Thug, Muscle, Racketeer, Mobster,
Wiseguy.
     The titles are: Godfather (wiz), Don (Territorial Crime Boss),
Leiutenant, Hit-Man, Soldier.
     There are also two special designations: Made, and Retired.
To attack a made man in any family is to invite a contract from the
Godfather.  Made men who cause trouble are usually Retired to a boat
near some tropical island...
** I definitely agree with all of this.  I think this is what will really give the
** guild style and make players want to be a part of it.

DISADVANTAGES:
     To be more than a soldier one must keep pk set.
     When a mobster dies they are returned to 'soldier'.
     Players may pk others in the guild.
     The amount of families and the measure of thier numbers are constant.
** These sound pretty good.  I also think making the guild 'no teleport' would
** fit well with the theme.  I don't understand the last disadvantage that you
** have listed.

ADVANTAGES:
     The ability to garnish coins from other players.
** I like this, but I don't see how it would work.  This is along the same lines
** of what I was thinking with the pickpocket, steal, and kidnap abilities.
________________________________________________________________________________

     As you can see this is not a presentation quality outline.  I just
slapped together some of the notes i have scribbled everywhere... There's
Some stuff about territories i'm leaving out but to give you a feel for
the result i had in mind;

GUILDAREA:
     The home of the Mob is a chicago city street.  Each 'Don' will
get a buisness on the street (mobsters are big on Italian restaurants,
brothels, nightclubs etc..).  The Godfather has his building at the end
of the road.
     Within the main room of each building there will be a table.  This
is where the Don or Leiutenant can make a 'feast' or a 'plate' for any
family member to enjoy.  There should also be a place for meetings and
a bulliten board though it could all go in one room.

** This sounds about right.  The details can be worked out later.

     If we 'Make' only a very few chosen and respected ppl (only enough
so that half the Dons on the block are made) it should provide enough
revolving power to give most everyone interested a try at being the
Don of a crime family.

** Yes, and this will also encourage pking within the guild, as more and
** more players will become power hungry to become a Don.

     It would seem that we have different ideas about many things...
We both seem interested in pk though :)  The way this is set up
will require some activity by the wizards responsible acting as the
godfather to accept/promote others into the Don position and to
sell the rights to specific territories. (Automation may be possible)

** At first, we (wizards) would probably have to act as godfathers, but I
** don't see why this couldn't become a players' role as the guild progresses.

I could keep going but i won't.  This should be enough to decide
what/if/how/where to go from here.  I like very much your attack
spells and was wondering myself how to work in a drive_by.  The
picture of a guy hanging off the running-boards of an old model-T
with the muzzle of his tommy gun blazing rules.  Then again, those
crips can sure light up the corner with those uzzi's...

** For the drive_by, I was picturing an ability where in a single round the
** player would be able to enter a room, fire a shot, and leave the room.
** This would probably have to be time-limited as to the use, and maybe make
** it a two-player combination attack (one for driving, and one for shooting).

In any case, i'm sure we can work something out.  Drop me a note and
tell me what you think.
                              -Languilen.
** Overall, I think this looks great :>  I like your theme much better than
** mine because it seems much more well-defined.  I was thinking that we should
** keep hammering out all of these details, and once that is decided, we can
** start splitting up the coding work, some sort of way.  Sound good?
