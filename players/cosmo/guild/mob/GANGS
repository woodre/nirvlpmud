THEME:
  Players in this guild should follow the guidelines of a mob/gangster/street
punks/rogue type theme.  I see this guild as being mostly a combat guild;
instead of having lots of spells, it will be based more on abilities.  And,
the more you use an ability, the better you become at it.  Obviously, the
guild will have an evil theme.  Within the guild, there could be various gang
splits:  Crips, Bloods, Piru, Disciples, Skinheads, Vice Lords.

ADVANTAGES:
  * Weapon bonuses for using 'knife' and 'gun' type weapons.
  * Attack bonuses for fighting in groups, e.g., gangs.
  * Excellent street smarts/skills.  This could come into play in several
    forms.

DISADVANTAGES:
  * All gangsters must be PK at all times.
  * Killing guild members in other gangs is allowed.
  * No teleporting.
  * Healing only from drugs and alcohol.

ABILITIES:
  * Pickpocket (from a player or NPC)      * Backstab
  * Steal (from a shop or vendor)          * Sharpshoot
  * Kidnap (mudkids or pets)               * Strangle
  * Gangbang                               * Execute
  * Spy                                    * Assault
  * Drive-by                               * Intimidate
  * Arson

ATMOSPHERE COMMANDS:
