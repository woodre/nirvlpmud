GRAFT RULES:
Much like players exchange exp for guild experience mobsters
exchange coins for graft.  Yes, there is a catch!  Players may not
exchange coins for graft directly; they must use the guild methods
availible.  Money gained through grafting is divided and distributed
among the family leaders. The following rules also apply.

1) Players under level 6 will not be affected. (when using block,
   newbies with less than 1k coins will be GIVEN coins instead).
2) Graft abilities directed at a player cannot be used when the target
   is in combat.
3) Rules for using block:
   a) The mobster blocking the exit must remain in that room.
   b) The mobster may only block one exit at a time.
   c) The mobster may not block an exit blocked by another mobster.
   d) May not be used in any room in the /room/ dir.
   e) May not be used in the locker area.
   f) May not be used in other guild halls.
4) Blackmail may be done from anywhere, but only once per boot per mobster.
5) Graft may NOT be exchanged for coins.
 
GRAFT DISTRIBUTION TABLE:
     Godfather   25%
     Don         25%
     Mobster     50%
If the mobster has not joined a family, the don's portion is sent to the
godfather.
