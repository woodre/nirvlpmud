COMBAT ABILITIES:
To replace the standard mud spells, Mobsters use the combat abilities
listed below.  These abilities cost graft instead of sps.  Mobsters
must reach the necessary guild level to use these abilities (see
w_levels for details).  Each ability also requires the purchase of an
additional item.  Because of the additional experience and the cost of
the extra item, these abilities will do slightly greater damage than
the normal mud spells.
