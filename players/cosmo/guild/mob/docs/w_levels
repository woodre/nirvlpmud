GUILD LEVELS:
There are seven guild levels in the Mobster guild:  bullie, thug,
muscle, racketeer, goodfella, mafioso, and wiseguy.  Every new guild member
starts out as a bullie.  Guild levels are attained through graft
and experience. The chart below illustrates the requirements.

GUILD LEVEL   EXPERIENCE COST   GRAFT COST
-----------   ---------------   -----------
Bullie               none            0
Thug                6,000           xx
Muscle            100,000           xx
Racketeer         700,000           xx
Goodfella       1,500,000           xx
Mafioso         4,000,000           xx
Wiseguy         6,000,000           xx

The guild also has levels within individual families.  Getting promoted
within a family costs graft, requires a minimum mud level, and must be
approved by the family leaders.  All guild members start out as Soldiers
and whenever they die, they are returned to Soldier status.  Death also
results in a loss of graft.  To advance past the Soldier level, members
must turn on their player killing status.
