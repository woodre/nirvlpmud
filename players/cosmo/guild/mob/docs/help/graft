GRAFT:
  Graft is defined as the act of gaining personal advantage or profit by
  dishonest or unfair means, especially through political connections.

  Graft is the basis for all Mobster activities.  Mobsters gain monetary
  profit (i.e., coins) through grafting abilities.  The profit that is
  gained gets distributed among the family leaders and then converted
  into graft.  Mobsters may use their graft to advance in the guild, to
  advance within their family, to purchase food at family restaurants,
  and to perform many combat abilities.
