THEME:
  The guild is centered around the 1920's Capone era gangsters.  Role-
  playing is mandatory and will be enforced.  The Guild abilities and
  structure are designed to facilitate active role-playing.

  Individual families compose the Mob as a whole.  The hierarchy within
  each family is just as important, if not more, than the common guild
  levels.  Within the Mob, power and prestige are gained through the
  use of graft money.  Player-killing status is mandatory to advance
  within a family.  Disputes between two families often must be solved
  through player-killing.
