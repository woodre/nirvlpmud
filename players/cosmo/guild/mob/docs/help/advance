ADVANCE:
  Success in the Mob is measured in two parts: the guild level and the
  inner family title.  Guild levels are raised through the trade of 
  graft and experience. Your family title is determined by a graft
  payment, availability, and the word of the Godfather, family Don, or
  family Lieutenant.

  Guild levels: Bullie, Thug, Muscle, Racketeer, Goodfella, Mafioso, Wiseguy
  Family titles: Soldier, Hitman, Lieutenant, Don, Godfather

  There are also two special designations: Made and Retired.

  - make          - plate        - account          - display
  - retire        - feast        - contracts        - ice
