   ABILITY:  lookout
   LEVEL:    Goodfella
   COST:     Medium graft

   DESCRIPTION:
     Use your bagman's guard dog to sit and watch a room.  Whenever
     someone enters that room, the guard dog will bark to alert you
     of the intruder's presence.  Use of this ability will leave your
     bagman vulnerable to attack since he will no longer have a guard
     dog to protect him.
