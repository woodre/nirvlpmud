AREAS:
  The territorial nature of the mob mainly effects the grafting
  abilities.  In the beginning all territories are considered 'owned'
  by the Godfather.  The Godfather imposes NO restrictions on the use
  of his property so ANY mobster may graft there.

  When a territory is bought by a Don it is considered his family's
  territory and an 'invasion' for any mobster not in that family to
  graft there.  Invasion of another family's territory will undoubtedly
  invoke a hostile response from the owning family.  Bottom line: if
  you chose to graft in an unfriendly territory, be prepared to face the
  consequences - you never know when you might start a family war.
