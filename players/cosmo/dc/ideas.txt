Ideas for DC area (11/19/97)
----------------------------

1.  A set of 'tools' that all rooms can use with functions such
as search, smell, taste.

2. Random policemen in three categories: park rangers,
city police (on foot), city police (on horse).  Once the policeman
is dead, the horse has a chance of being used like Beck's
John Deere tractor.  Also, random alignment of say 300-rand(400)
for a chance to have "bad" cop.  Hmm... description based on
alignment.

3. Ditto #2 for building guards -- random chance of different
classes of guards.

4. Briggs armored car truck.

5. ATM machines: fees for withdrawals, holding fees as well.
Players can deposit money (up to a max), but the money decreases
in value over time, and there is a cost for withdrawal.

KEY POINT: randomness.
