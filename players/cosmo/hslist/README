The files in this directory relate to an object which tracks
experience and creats a high score list based on the reboot cycle.
Comments/suggestions for improvements are always welcome.

The object for viewing the scores and updating the all-time scores is:
   /players/cosmo/hslist/vds.c

This object inherits many functions from:
   /players/cosmo/hslist/vdsfuns.c

The object that is called by add_exp() to collect the exp data is:
   /players/cosmo/hslist/exp_store.c

The alltime data is stored in:
   /players/cosmo/hslist/alltime.o

An object for testing purposes that generates random data and sends it 
to exp_store.c (just like add_exp() does) is:
   /players/cosmo/hslist/vdstest.c
