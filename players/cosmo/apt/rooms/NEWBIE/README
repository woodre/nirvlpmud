NEWBIE RAT AREA - created by Cosmo
----------------------------------
This area is meant to be an extension of Seinfeld's apartment
area.  There are two entrances to the rat area:
	~/apt/rooms/elevator.c
	~/apt/rooms/hole.c

NOTE: The new versions of these files are currently stored as
      elevator_NEW.c and hole_NEW.c.  They will be renamed after
      the area has been approved.

This is meant to be a newbie area so only players less than
level 6 may enter.  Within the rat area there are 30 rooms, 
numbered sequentially from h1.c to h30.c.  All rooms are
contained in:
	~/apt/rooms/NEWBIE/

Each room randomly generates rats from the init() function,
with a maximum of 3 rats per room and 30 rats in the whole
area, per reset.  The rats are all called from:
	~/apt/mon/rats.c

Each time a rat is generated there is a 60% chance of it being
a small (level 3-6) rat, a 30% chance of it being a medium 
(level 7-10) rat, and a 10% chance of it being a large
(level 11-13) rat. The medium rats have a 50% chance of being
aggressive and the large rats have an 80% chance of being
aggressive.  Each rat carries a piece of cheese which may
be either sold or eaten as a food heal.  The value of the
cheese varies with the level of the rat.

A map of the rooms in this area may be found in:
	~/apt/rooms/NEWBIE/MAP.txt

Initial completion on 10/5/98.
