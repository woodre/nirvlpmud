     I spent some time going through the rooms in your area and found the
following items for you to address:
~elevator.c - floor descript, tile appears to be 'loose'.
~rbubble.c - boy has too many coins when his bubble is included.
	     - there are no exits from this room that I could find.
	     - I could not wear the bubble, is this intended?
~rcafe.c - no exit from this room
~rflower.c  - no exit from this room unless one could 'guess' to cross the 
	        street (pretty vague)
~rnazi.c  -  would be nice to be able to smell the aroma
	  -  the heals are too cheap.  (35 heal * 13 pts per heal at 11 food)
	     equals 455 coins per shot of soup.  cup = 455, bowl 1820 minimum.
	  -  no exit
~rstreet.c - can't look at shops
~rs1-8.c  - can't look at shops
~rs2.c  -  the description mentions the building elevator which assumes that
	   the player has visited there. Keep your room descripts to the room
	   they are talking about.
~rs6.c  -  couldn't look at street to know to 'cross'
~rs8.c  -  couldn't look at 'accident' or 'paramedics'

The water heal that Elaine has cannot be used by the dmages because you use
'drink' to use it and they cannot use intox heals which are 'drink_alcohol'.
You might want to find another verb since this is a 'soak' heal.

This is a very good first effort.  Your attention to detail was obvious and
your descriptions for the most part were very good.  Snow is looking over the
monsters but I would think with the above corrections, you should be able to
'get opened' shortly.  Congrats on a fine job...   -Eurale
