                ****** SEINFELD ******

Cosmo's first area -- completed for approval on 4/17/97.
-----------
  Special thanks to Balowski, Eurale, Llew, Pain, Pavlik,
and Mythos for all of their help, example files, and answers
to my endless questions.
-----------
Files used in this area: 
  All files in /players/cosmo/apt and its subdirectories;
bat.c and bertha.c in ~/weap;
babyblue.c, bubble.c, chefhat.c, goldenboy.c,
helmet.c, and usps.c in ~/armor.
-----------
Background of area:
  This area is based on the TV show Seinfeld.  Most monster, object,
and room ideas are taken from that show, and every attempt was made
to stick to the theme of the show.
-----------
Room links:
  The player begins in the lobby of an apartment building and the
only exit is to an elevator.  In the elevator, there are seven random
exits: Newman's Room(12%), Elaine's Room(12%), Steinbrenner's Room(12%),
Geroge's Room(12%), Bubble Boy's Room(12%), a hallway(20%), and out to
a street(20%).  The elevator also has an emergency phone.  If used, the
phone will return the player to the castle entrance: /room/plane1.
  From each room that has a 12% chance, the player may return to the
elevator by opening the door.  From the hallway, there are two doors
which lead to Jerry's room and Kramer's room, and there is a button
which leads back to the elevator.  Opening the door in either Jerry or
Kramer's room leads back to the hallway.
  From the street, the player has four choices.  Enter the building and
end up back in the lobby, crawl down the manhole and end up in Pavlik's
tiny sewer area, or go east or west.  The east/west road centers on this
initial room, and from these street rooms, exits may be found for a
Coffee Shop, Soup Shop, and Flower Shop.
