"... and Horlach lowered his knee to HIM
and swore eternal fealty to HIM.  For HE
had shown Horlach the error that he had 
made.  HE then allowed Horlach to rise
and creating a Portal, HE and General 
Horlach stepped thru to Other Worlds beyond.
And we wept to see that Horlach had 
been right, we had lost the Path. And
now even as the blades of our tormentors 
pierce us, the pain we truly feel is the 
fact that we have been cast out.. that the
Fae has abadoned us and that we are left
with nothing....."

"... and so I end my task of compiling the
history of the Order.  I hope that you, the 
reader, have learned and understand the 
tragedy of those who were led astray by 
Lamerith the Traitor."
