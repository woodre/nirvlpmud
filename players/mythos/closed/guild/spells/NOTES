cause_miss  Ok. 20-Aug-98

true_darkness  remove it. It lasts Wayyyyyy tooo long..... a 20 fay will
               result in protection for 1000 seconds. 16 mins.
               Guilds should not have powers that overcome their 
               drawbacks.


chill_shield.h / cshield.c  6 damage, 100 coin, 10sp every 3 second.
             heal_self->6*3=18sp -10sp  8sp. 100/30 = 3 sp. =>11sp true
             cost. (heal_self should be the high hit player cost at min,
             will be added to doc)

cold_shield  why another version? this one looks to be more out of proportion.

cold_area   another? ? ?
