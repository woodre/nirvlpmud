"... I would not choose to step upon
this path if the choice had been mine
alone.  But the choice isnt mine
to fully make and so now we are at war....
If only we had listened to HE who taught us,
for HE had warned us of the stupidity of
our search for the Tyrlnal.
Now that we have found it, I finally
understand the gravity of our mistake.
Horlach was right, it is our destiny to
die so that the strong may gain.
To that end we strive.  My only hope is
that those who follow us shall not make
our mistake and decide to forsake the PATH.
Ack! Let the attack commence!"
