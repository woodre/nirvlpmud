desc "Luthien's RoomThe walls of this room pulse with some hidden energy.Ominous, atonal sounds buzz around you making ittotally impossible to focus or concentrate onanything.  To the SOUTH you see several tables and chests,covered and filled with strange, mystical devices and texts.On the WEST wall hang various pieces of armor and weaponry.Deep green and Crimson blankets make a soft-lookingpallet in the NORTHWEST corner of the room.  Against theNORTH wall is a chair, hand-crafted from Fae, by Morgaine,Luthien's beloved wife.  A Portal of swirling mist lies onthe EAST wall."
