desc "Chode's RoomYou have entered Chode's private quaters. This a large roomwith several old paintings hanging on the walls. As you glancefrom painting to painting you notice each must be hundreds of years old. The largest painting is of a powerful looking man, witha closer look you notice a plaque at the bottom that reads: Horlachthe Seeker. This was painted by someone unknown shortly after he left the order.Some called him a genuis, for that he was. Others called hima traitor for the murder of the wanderer, Roiser.No matter what anyone says, Chode has sworn to one day seek outHorlach and bring him back to the order. You notice after lookingevery painting of: Horlach, Balberith, Cardiou, Lamerith and Roiserthat there is one missing, maybe the most important. There is nopainting of the Hunter. Chode has searched far and wide to findone, with no luck. You also see another painting that is unfinished,at the first look you can see Chode has been painting the Prophet.One day maybe this collection will be complete."
