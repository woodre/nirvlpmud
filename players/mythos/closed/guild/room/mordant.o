desc "Mordant's RoomA largish window set in one wall gives a view of the seashore, the sound of the waves can be dimly heard over the crackling of the fire burning softly in the fireplace.Below the window is a large purplish sofa, covered in a velvety fabric and deeply cushioned.Standing before the sofa is a small coffee table of cherry wood, the soft light of the fire gleaming of its dark, rich stain.  Matching tables stand at each end of the sofa."
