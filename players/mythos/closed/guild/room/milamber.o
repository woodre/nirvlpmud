desc "Milamber's RoomThe power of the fae floods this room.  It is a large room whose exact dimensions are hard to tell because of the contant flowing Fae.The rooms contains a large mahogany desk with all sorts of arcane equipment on it.There is also a couch in here that is obviously for vistorshowever, the most striking thing about the room is the back corner.In this corner the dark fae is incredibly dense, so as to block all light into this area.  You get the feeling that this is the sleep area of Milamber."
