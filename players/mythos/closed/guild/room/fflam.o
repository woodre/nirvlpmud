desc "Fflam's RoomYou step into Fflam's quarters, three rooms in his guild that arewell-appointed, if perhaps a little dark.  The walls are all in wood-paneling,the floors with fine rugs.  Fflam entertains guests in the sitting room, thewalls of which are covered with books, many of his own authorship, and furnishedwith a couch, two comfortable chairs, and a coffee table.  The bedroom is simplyappointed, with a double bed and a table stached with a number of books.  Aclosed door leads to a small bathroom.  The exit is a ring of stone in thecorner of the sitting room, that allows Fflam and his guests access to quite anumber of places.  The commands Fflam can use (so he won't forget) are:    add_descrip  store  restore  invite  on  off"
