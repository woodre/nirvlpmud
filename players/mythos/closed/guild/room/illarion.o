desc "Illarion's RoomYou have entered Illarion's room, a place of quiet and shelter.  The wallsare paneled in dark wood, carved into subtle patterns.  Set into the westwall is a large stone hearth, under a beautiful mahogany mantle.  Above themantle hangs a Sword of the Spirits cloaked in an aura of Fear.  Facing thefireplace are two overstuffed tapestry chairs, flanking an antique marble-topped end table.  On the opposite end of the room, a large leaded glasswindow with a double window seat and curtains for the window and for thewindow seats.  The south end of the room contains a large bed with a fancifulwrought-iron frame, a down filled coverlet, and sheer white curtains drapedover the nearly ceiling-height posts.  An antique armoire stands next tothe bed, and a matching chest is at the foot.  Opposite the bed, mahoganybookshelves stretch from the floor to the ceiling, bearing tomes ofknowledge.  Fine rugs cover most of the hardwood floor, except for onesection inlaid in a compelling pattern of silver: the exit."
