desc "Ronin's Room  You step into a darkened cave.  All about you hang bloodied shackles,some still holding battered corpses within their rusty grasp. Upon closerlook, you see that quite a few of the bodies are those of the doomedknights Templar.  Badly beaten and tortured to near mutilation, mostare nearly unidentifiable, except for perhaps a bit of clothing or theworn remnants of a templar cross.  In the middle of the room sits awaist high Altar....bloody pulps of rotting flesh still decorate itssurface, as pools of goo coagulate in its small imperfections.In a corner sits a small table, as inornate as the rest of the room, butlying on it can be found many organized papers.  Each detailing plansfor the takeover and annihilation of the Knights, forever.     War             <========\\========}-----+         Peace in Death"
