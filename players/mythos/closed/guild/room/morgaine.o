desc "Morgaine's Room     A warm fire crackles in the large stone hearth dominating the south wall of this chamber, providing the main source of light and warmth.  A thick, cream colored fur rug spreads on the floor before the fire, and several large, ivory and gold brocade pillows have been scattered about, forming a loose grouping.  A waist high, kingsize featherbed takes up most of the north wall, its carved mahogany posts matching the intricately carved head and footborads.  Thick ivory and gold brocade draperies hang over the bed's canopy, casting deep shadows onto the dozens of silk pillows propped up atop silken sheets and a deep gold silk, down filled coverlet.  A loom, its tapestry nearly finished, stands in the west corner opposite a tall oval mirror.  The mirror is covered with a silken shroud."
