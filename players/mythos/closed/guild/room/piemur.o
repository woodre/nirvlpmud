desc "Piemur's RoomA dark light encircles this small room, filled only withthe necessities of life.  A small cubby on the north wallwith food and other such things in it.  Along the eastwall there is a small bed roll with a candle sitting ina stand next to it.  On the oppisite side of the room isa shimmering portal which can leave to many places."
