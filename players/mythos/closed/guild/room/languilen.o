desc "Languilen's RoomA void of blackness surrounds you, made blacker still by the hint of an object directly in front of you.  When your eyes adjust you can barely see the feint outline of a plush chair. It seems to be woven from the shimmering fabric of the dark fae itself and is the only thing to offer you any sense of stability here.  To look elsewhere is to invite vertigo."
