desc "Kalack's RoomYou enter a room of gloom...there is little here.  This room isever changing to its masters will.  Once Where there was a chair now sits a bench or a table.  Everything looks shriveled andwithered except a portion of the room off in the corner.  Thereis a glowing picture of someone.  The room notices your attentiontowards that part of itself and gloom and dark suddenly blot thecorner out.  "Take a sseat" whispers the voice of Kalack, the words "Enjoy your sstay" are suddenly forced into your mind without hearing them.  The room seems to chuckle as you settle in."
