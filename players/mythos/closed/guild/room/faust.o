desc "Faust's RoomYou have entered a small, dark room.  Two braziers stand on either side, smoldering with a soft light.  Shadows dance across the walls in unnatural patterns.  Faust takes a seat on his throne, a giant chair constructed from the skull of the Great Wyrm, Icingdeath.  You have entered the domain of the chosen one.  Act accordingly."
