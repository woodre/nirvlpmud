desc "Wulfgar's RoomYou enter into the room of Wulfgar. Dark shadows cover the wallswhich seem to absorb in all of the light. Strange sounds of wailingand screams of pain are occasionaly heard. On the one wall, there isa Fireplace of sorts. It glows with a cold blue flame which seemsto cool the room intead of heat it. The only light that it casts inis focused on a small bare pedastal."
