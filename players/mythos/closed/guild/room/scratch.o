desc "Scratch's Room	You have entered the quarters of Jack Scratch, formerly of the RDF, theArmy of the Southern Cross, and the REF.  The quarters are fairly spartan...a comfortable couch faces a large-screen television and home entertainmentunit, there are a few easy chairs scattered about, a fully-accesorizedpersonal computer, and a small hallway leading back to the bathroom and sleeping unit.  There is a wet bar with stools, a small but fully equippedkitchenette, and a gun rack containing Jack's assortment of shotguns andenergy weapons.  The walls are bare aside for a few framed plaques and medals denoting his distinguished military service, and framed photos ofhis REF unit, the legendary Omni Squad--depicting Jack surrounded by hiscomrades; Emile, Branti, Bigfoot, Outback, Redeye, and the rest.  Jack hasmade his functional quarters seem like a home.  There is a turbolift givingaccess to other areas of the MUD directly behind you."
