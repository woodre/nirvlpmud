desc "Laera's RoomLaera is finally rid of those unsightly boxes and has transformed her room into a home.In a bright and sunny alcove off to the side is a huge cannonball bed covered in a soft, fluffly duvet and several pillows.  Next to the bed is her nightstand, a small lamp, a vase of fresh flowers and the latest romance novel on it.Across from her bed is a large walk-in closet.The ultra-modern kitchen is to the left of the door.  You glimpse a cozy breakfast table and chairs, gleaming counters and several appliances.The huge bathroom is to the right of the door.  Peeking inside you see a large hot tub, glass enclosed shower and a supply of comfy terry robes and towels.An inviting sofabed graces her living room.  Several pillows lay carefully arranged on it.  A glass coffee table sits in front of the sofa.  On the table is a remote control and as she picks it up, music flows from the stereo discreetly hidden in her wall.Two comfortable lazyboys flank the sofa."
