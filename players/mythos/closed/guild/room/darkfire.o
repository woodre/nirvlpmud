desc "Darkfire's Room<*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*>                      Darkfire's Private Study<*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*>You have entered Darkfire's private study.  Although it is a veryspacious room, with a fourteen foot ceiling, twenty feet wide andthirty feet long,  it is surprisingly comfortable.  The marbledgrey carpeting is soft underfoot, and the natural stone walls arecomforting in their solidity and chill strength. A very largefireplace, nearly ten feet wide and five feet deep, and apparentlycarved from a single slab of obsidian stone, occupies the southeastcorner of the room.  A cold blue flame flickers quietly in thefireplace, radiating a soothing chill. Arranged around the fireplaceare several very comfortable chairs, a couch covered in a very unusualdark grey leather, a light grey futon on a dark stained teak frame,and a small, low table made of polished ebony inlaid with silver.Upon the table rests a small crystal sphere, which flickers with thelight of the fireplace, as if it were capturing the blue flames insideof it, letting them play throughout it's depths like a living thing.The entire northern half of the room is occupied by floor to ceilinglibrary stacks, filled to overflowing with books, scrolls, andmiscellaneous artifacts of interest to Darkfire.<*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*>"
