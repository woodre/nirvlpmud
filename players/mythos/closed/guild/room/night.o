It is carved from asolid piece of rock and is impenatrable from the outside.  Thewalls are hung with rich purple and wine colored tapestry.  Thefloor is made of black obsidian tiles and very glassy.  There is ahuge onyx table in the middle of the room with matching benchesencircling it.  Trophies of battles won line the walls as a displayof the skill of the room owner.  This is a great place to gather torelax or plan........ as warriors or friends.  Welcome all who areinvited here...."
