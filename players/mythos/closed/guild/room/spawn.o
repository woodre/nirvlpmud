desc "Spawn's RoomShrouded in Darkness and Mystery is this room. Having no light yet there is shadow.  The shadows, they weave and wander all over the room.  Through there weaving you barely catch a glimps of the murals painted on the walls.  The murals they depict gory rituals to demons and gods unknown.  You look up at the ceiling and catch a glimps of glowing eyes, you wonder, are they real, and you realize you don't want to know.  In the corner you see a huge bed, it seems like it would take up all the space in this tinyroom, yet somehow it doesn't. Black silk sheets adorn it, and skulls are the posts.  You see portals to different places in the realm, and some that are not on this earth. choose one and see where you end up."
