desc "Zeus's RoomYou are in a large dark chamber, the only light is coming from black candles that line the walls, buring with a blood red flame.  The chamber is completly silent, and very peaceful.  Pelts from various creatures that once inhabited Nirvana line the walls, as do paintings by Boris.  Various bookshelves contain untold amounts of knowledge.  Zeus' desk sits in a corner of the chamber, strewn with scrolls and artifacts."
