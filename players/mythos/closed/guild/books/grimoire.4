    Consider this:  We are material.  We toy with material items to
create energy.  And from this energy we have 'power'.  [example: One
must use wood upon wood, and through friction can create fire.  Fire
gives us light and heat- forms of energy]  However, we can not touch 
upon the power of infinity- a power that goes beyond the bindings
of Law of Nature.  Even through the manipulation of energy- through
material- we can not touch infinity.  Yet, if one were able to use
energy directly, could not infinity be reached?  Demons seem to be 
be able to do this  [Not the demons that simply create destruction
but demons that are the sort that one can have an intellectual 
discourse with] and so do the higher powers- but with a large price.
They are energy, and so may be controlled by the right materials and
the right force.  Thus many of the Adepts of my time have controlled
those demons- those beings of energy- and have forced them into 
toying with infinity [The old rites of the Golden Dawn and even now
the groups who call themselves 'guilds' do this].  Unfortunately, 
often the higher beings would enact revenge and the Adept would never
be seen again.
