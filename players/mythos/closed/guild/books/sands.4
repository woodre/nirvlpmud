  I cringed at HIS words for they were the TRUTH.  All that I or the Order
had achieved was petty.  I knew it then, I knew what it was that We had
missed- that simple foundation to which We had blinded ourselves from, and
it shattered me. HE continued:
   
                "But I have not summoned you to see what"
                "you have become.  Information is what I"
                "will gift.  What you do with it is what"
                "you will."

  HIS eyes glittered and I trembled.  Suddenly, before US three figures
appeared. A beautiful young maiden- rich black hair cascading down her
back, a mature lady- high and regal, and an old crone- back bent and a
single eye.  All three were intently viewing a large tapestry.
