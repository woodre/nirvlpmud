Preface: 

   I send this tome to you dear reader, across the vast infinities of time
and space, at the time of your greatest need.  When you recieve this,
know that it marks the beginnings of a danger so great that all that you
have Known and Seen will pale in comparison.  I write to you (you who are the 
inheriters of our twisted dreams and desires) with a hand held steady by 
will alone and with a head and heart filled with, yes, fear.  I, who created 
an order that not only conquered fear, but feeds on fear itself, am left 
shuddering and shaking with a terror that grips deep within the soul.  
Before I must recant my tale understand this, do not take any of this lightly 
for the consenquences are high, and heed this above all: We were wrong.
