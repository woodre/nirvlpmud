    Seek not anything till you know when the time is come, else
may the Gods and the Demons hold back the flow of danger that shall
meet you at every corner.  And let not fear escape too often, better,
none at all, for fear is your tool not your enemy.
     Search the Tower that our Great Founder has trapped those 
creatures of chaos and terror.  For through them may things become
yours to use and control.  Yet be wary of these creatures for they 
powerful and death abides near them.
     Invoke all objects that legend speaks of, for perhaps something
shall come of it.  Yet, be careful for it is a two edged sword that
you wield.
     Know that the Great One shall come back and that He will take a
great sword upon Us- cleaving away those who can not follow His 
Path.  So, tread swiftly and carefully upon the hidden paths of His
Works and Trust above all yourself.
