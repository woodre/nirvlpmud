  
	Beware of all things, for should you tread upon the wrong path you
shall die- Horlach was a thorough man.  
	Yet why venture if such great peril to the body exists?  Know that
if Rosier is left trapped, Horlach shall win.  His dominion over his
creatures and Daemons is strong- and while Rosier is trapped, his 
strength grows.
	Do not let danger stop you.  Do not let power overcome you.  Free
the tormented soul and things shall be done.
