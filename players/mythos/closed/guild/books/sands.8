  My children, our inheritors, listen carefully.  It is you and only 
you who can right the wrong that We have done.  For even now I, Lamerith
of the Bloodied Hand- whose hand shall always bleed eternally from the
wound that Horlach placed in battle, have begun to feel the hungers, 
diseases, and pains that have already claimed my fellow brethren.  
When two signs light the skies of our mortal world, seek out the Portal
of Orith, for therein lies the instrument of our dark Brother.  Prevent
him from taking it and the Key to our Order else know that the doom
shall be complete and all our strivings will become for not.
  With this final command I close the tome of time and join my brethren
in Awaited Judgement, He who reads this tome first become the guardian
of our Order.  Guard well the Threshold until HE comes back, warn your
brothers when the lock begins to strain.  Become the Prophet of the Order
and prepare your brothers for the WAR.
