to all that I needed.  For the tree sustained Us, just as He did.  
And like the tree, did we need the blood of many.  So I dug into the
earth, and reached the tree's roots, and there I placed an essence of
my being, for those of our following to find and embrace.  And with a 
salute I left him there, tending Our tree.  
    I wandered on, and found great a many wonders.  Night befriended
I, as did Star.  The Dragons of Lys came at my call and Death's Demon
fell before me.  And I slowly I fed and learned.
    My mind did wander too, as did I, and I slowly saw that our Order
was becoming not.  Horlach found the creatures of the the Nexus and
began to toy with the material.  The Gates of Ebra opened at his 
command and They began to destroy.  His stupidity lead him to a path
that only the insane dare go.  And it destroyed him.  But what he did
changed everything.  Let none touch the Orb, let none open the Gates,
let none sleep in the Night, let none invvoke the Talisman of Blood.  .  
These I charge ye all, else the END appear.
Here I end the first book of my wanderings.
