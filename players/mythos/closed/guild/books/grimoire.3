    I was an Adept of that time.  I was born knowing and feeling
the 'fae' swirl around me.  All was color and all was light.  Each
strand of 'fae' was different, in hue, in color, in strength.  And
know this my dear reader, that this is the key to it all.
    The 'fae' are living things.  They wander and play, they move
according to the dictates of the strongest will.  Bend your will 
and the 'fae' shall follow.  A link to nature and will.  For 
understand that change and will are as tightly linked as are nature
and fae. 
    Crowley dictates that any required change may be effected by the
application of the proper kind and degree of Force in the proper 
manner through the proper medium to the proper object. The force is 
the will and the medium is the 'fae'.  Yet what of the manner and the
medium?
    The answer lies within the ideas the Gods have placed within 
this universe.  Material, energy, and Infinity.  Those three cover 
all that there is in this universe and their boundaries are rather
strict and concrete.
