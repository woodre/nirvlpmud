    1. Follow the dictates of the Law.
    
    2. Know that naming is only a means of restriction.  Thus let
       this Order be left nameless.  Yet if others must point at
       the Order, let them point to the Order of Thelema- that 
       great order of law- to find the truth of labeling.  And if
       yet they must try and bind the Order to a name, let them
       know that whatever you choose shall be it.  Let them see
       the errors of their ways in naming- for the Order simply
       is and is nameless.  
       
    3. Bind all other things but let yourself be free.  Follow the
       path and magic shall lead.
       
    4. Learn about who you are.  Find the path that shall lead to
       greatest understanding and power.  Bend no knee to those
       who are below you.
