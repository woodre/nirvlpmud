  At first all that I could see were the threads of strange 
iridescence and patterns.  Then as I stared and probed, the threads
gave way to a plane of Visions.  The Gates of Ebra ripped open,
the flow of a River of Blood, the jaws of the DreadLords, the

HE spoke with a tone of anger.

                "Now you see what it is you have wrought."
                "What I warned you and your siblings"
                "repeatedly.  Yes, I know of your crimes."
                "That which you did to save your pride."
                "Binding the soul of an immortal mortal"
                "to the tool I have given you, turning a"
                "key into a lock.  Remember, nothing lasts"
                "forever that has been forged by the hands"
                "of mortals."
