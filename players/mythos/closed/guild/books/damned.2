  
	Listen carefully, oh Children of the Hunt, for this is a tale that
you have great need to hear.  Long have I awaited to speak and now
I am freed- beware of Me, for I am That Which shall Be Nameless.
	Your destruction is coming soon, your powers shall be taken, and
all that He has made shall be destroyed- unless you free the soul of
one of your brethren.
	Deep within the Hills of Deacrom lies the Taormin.  Yes, that fabled
stone of great power of which Horlach coveted so much but never found.  
And in the hills, with the Taormin, sits a pedastal under which Rosier 
lies- trapped.  Horlach did not destroy her, but rather, trapped her 
soul until the day the Taormin is placed upon the pedastal.  End her 
suffering, else all shall be made incomplete- all shall become nothing.
	The Taormin is not an easy stone to find.  For it is hidden deep within
the Spear of Drafnor.  Only the Banished Blade- that blade with which 
Horlach slayed with- can cut deeply into the Spear. And the Spear itself
is hidden.  Only the subdued Dragon can tell you.
