    Listen, oh children, to the one who has come before you.  I am
Horlach the Seeker, one who calls upon the Great Beast's name and
number, he who finds all that must be found, the binder of bindings.
Upon these pages I scribe the knowledge that I lend you, and know 
that it is lent, for one day I shall exact a price, and the price
shall be paid.  Know that upon reading this that portals of knowledge
shall open before you and power shall become yours.
    First, deep within forest is the castle.  Search for that to learn
secrets that one needs to know. And know that my creations also exist
there.  That Jewel that I had gredged up from the darkest regions of 
Darm and the valley of Seal, exists within that region, placed for you
to feel the darkness and allow the soul to be at one with the shadows.
Feel the keen edges of the blades placed within and let nex be yours 
for the circle can only be bound in that way and tremble evermore.
But beware for the castle holds its dangers.  The bound Keeper lies 
within and death is yet a sly slip of word as the fae abides within.
