dubbed- Demons or Devils.  Whatever it was, IT came, and He made a 
pact with IT.  A pact that none knows, yet all can see that it gave 
Him much.  A pact that shook the very core of this world and 
unleashed powers that have yet to be tamed.
    Other tales tell of his Forest.  That forest at the edge of a 
small village.  The forest that we play within it.  His forest was 
a place of terror- where spirits ran abound and strange beings lived.
He took upon himself a great experiment and recreated this forest 
into a land of balanced terror.  Every creature, every microbe, every
tree was created and changed by Him.  Those creatures whom He did 
not like, He chained within a Tower, and left them trapped and 
changed- yet all was with a great purpose and a plan so complex that 
none have yet solved it.  It was this forest that gave Him the name,
that title that He holds- the Hunter, for He was a hunter.  Other 
beings were His prey, His toys, His tests.  He was feared and a reign
of terror ruled.  He was the stuff of Nightmares, the stuff of Legends
come true.
