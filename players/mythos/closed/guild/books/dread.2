	Listen carefully, oh Children of the Hunt, your education has
just begun.  The secrets to all that you wish is before you- but 
your eyes have yet begun to open.
	Know that doom is coming....  know that death is at the door.
And be prepared for it, else all shall be destroyed.
	Create an army, command the demons, and defend yourselves.  
Only a mirror into the soul can help.  Powerful you may seem, yet
true power is not yours yet.  For They will come and you will seem
to be a small ant as compared to Them.
	Know the enemy you face commands the very Dreads of Life.  The
creatures that know no bounds and hold all in contempt- life itself
bows before such Dread Lords, for they are Anti-Life.
	The Portal of Orith leads the way to an answer, but only those
who UNDERSTAND Death itself may pass.
