Preface:
  
  Perhaps this is the oddest book of our sacred readings.  It suddenly
appeared on my desk in my secret study, along with the Book of Dread,
the day after the Closing*.  It appeared with no signature and no 
additional notes.  As I read this text, it began to dawn on me that 
whoever had written this had a mind so keen and brilliant that the 
very heart of Reality was at his/her grasp.  I researched deeply to see 
if the writer had left any clue as to who he/she was.  When I realized 
who had written this, I trembled and shook for then did I realize what 
danger we all were in.  I tried to warn my brethren, but to no avail- 
for somehow I could not voice nor write the name of he/she who had 
written this.  I can only hope that you who read this may figure it
out before all shall be destroyed.
