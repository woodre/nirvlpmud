  On the night of the Darkest Day of our Order a vision fell upon me, nay,
not a vision, but a mystic sense of the Beyond. It smashed through my
consciousness as I feasted upon the Hunt, it smothered me and felled me
where I stood. My brethren tell me that they had seen me fall, but when
they rushed to the place where I had fallen, they found nothing- that I had
vanished.  Perhaps in truth I had vanished from the basic plane of
existance, for all that I know is that when I had aroused from a deep dark
slumber, a sleep filled with rivers of blood, I found myself standing upon
a ridge overlooking the world.  From my vantage nothing could not be seen,
for if I wished to view something, my will alone would let me view it.  I
reveled in the power that I had and suddenly I knew that I had more.  Light
did not hurt me nor did I feel the pangs of the Hunger. Fire was at my
command as well as ice.  I knew that Death could no longer touch me- I had
Ascended.
