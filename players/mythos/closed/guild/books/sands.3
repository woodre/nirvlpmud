  After much time of wonder and glory, a footfall sounded from behind.
Turning, I saw HIM.  HE in HIS glory and power.  I felt as I always did
before HIM- like that of a child.  HIS blazing dark eyes graced me and I
was struck down.  Knowledge and Despair filled me- I was insignificant next
to HIM, that my journey had just begun and that all before was just a
preview. HE held me by HIS power, lifted me above the ground.  Terror
filled me, that feeling that I had assumed would no longer overcome me,
only for me to find that I was still nothing... nothing next to HIM.  Rage
and despair lurked within as well. I wished to strike out at HIM, to change
HIS expression of contempt into anything but that.  But I knew, there was
nothing I could do.  And then HE spoke:  

             "I see Lamerith, you have not changed.  Seems"
             "that growth is something you have yet to"
             "achieve.  Yet, what is one to expect of one"
             "who does not SEE?  Life and Death thrash at"
             "at you, blinding you from power and path."
             "Here's a secret for you- Horlach was closer"
             "to the truth at his prime than any of you."
             "Yet, even he is lost. Pity the loss...."
