I poked around in the driver source once again to see why I wrote that
shadows can intercept messages.
It _is_ true: A shadow can redefine catch_tell and the shadow will then
receive all messages sent to the shadowed object, unless the shadow is
the originator of the message. That lets you e.g. do a simple filter:
In the shadowing object:

  object player; /* object that we shadow */

  catch_tell(msg) {
      string who, rest;
      if (sscanf(msg, "%s %s", who, rest) == 2 && who == "moo") {
              /* all from moo is filtered out */
      } else {
              tell_object(player, msg); /* this doesn't get intercepted */
      }
  }

Now, mind that I haven't tried this myself, but I am thinking that there
might be some little quirks here. Like, a shadowing catch_tell may receive
all messages twice and messages that are filtered out won't show on snoop.
