/* Oks lets start with basics here
  first, this weapon has never been changed even when it was requested so I have taken the liberty of
  changing it.]  It is now fully legal
  Second, Hawkeye, originally, had line 16, the x = 0;
  on line 20, this makes it so that whenever the got the special
  the x value was fixed till he got the special again
  therefore players would get return 'x' on the special and until they
  got the special the 'x' would remain
  Also, the random query was not random(3)==0
  but rather this_player()->query_alignment > 500
  this made it so that players with alignment above 500
  i.e. most paladins, bards, etc. would always get the return
  last of all the return was 9 + random(9) which is far above the legal 
standards- quite frankly not good
  so i have changed it as you can see and the return averages to about 7 which is legal
  for saveables.
  if you have any gripes or comments please contact me
  directly
