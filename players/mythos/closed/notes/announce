Terra Nova Interactive Corporation is pleased to announce the upcoming 
alpha release of its new 3D graphical MUD, "Other Realms: Meridian 59."  

This game will for the first time enable you to interact with other 
players and with the environment in full 3D: talk with other players, 
explore the countryside (alone or with a group), slay monsters, find 
treasure, learn skills, solve puzzles, and take part in the political 
intrigue that's bubbling up (word has it the king is insane, and may 
even have killed the queen... but this is just rumor) -- all in fully 
animated, first-person 3D.

Players use fully animated avatars with a wide range of appearances 
(millions of unique appearances possible), and can communicate with 
others using text, gestures, facial expressions, ...or the point of 
a sword.

It's not just a shooter, and it's not just chat.  It is a multi-player 
gaming experience like no other.  

A free alpha version of the Other Realms client program will be made 
available for downloading beginning December 15, 1995.  This will be a 
limited alpha version; we will be adding many capabilities and areas of 
the world in the coming weeks.  The client will be available via our web 
site at http://www.terranova.com/~sellers.  The full version of the game,
with a greatly expanded world and expanded features, will be made 
available on CD-ROM in 1996.

The game requires a 486/66 with 8Mb of RAM to run (and this will run 
it well -- you don't need a Pentium to really play).  It runs under 
Windows 3.1, Windows NT, and Windows 95 (Mac version coming soon!), 
and requires a SLIP/PPP connection to the Net.  Additional technical 
information is available at our web site.

In the meantime, please visit our website (www.terranova.com/~sellers) 
for additional information and clues into the workings of Other Realms.  
We're also giving away Cool Stuff to a random selection of people who 
fill out the survey on our page.  

See you in Other Realms!
