heya bud...here's her requested specs...

Weapon short:   Reaper of Nightmaers
Weight:   1
Weaponclass:   17
Specials:   similar to daranath's giant killer...vs dreams and nightmares it gets a +10 wc return and a kewl emote....

Long desc:     The Long dark stained wood of the handle of this wicked scythe is curved and wrought with the runes of chaos.  The blade itself has a cold feel and the same black steel shine as the molten metal of the hooves that Nightmares posess.  The serpentine haft bears the marks of battles from time immemorial.  The very stuff of dreams fuels its power.

Emotes:   (you can come upo with a ton no doubt)
   The essence of $T id shorn away by the wicked scythe.
	$T is faced with thier nightmares and howls in terror.
	$P mows down $T with the scythe...

for the special:  Thhe Sythe vibrates and drinks deeply of $T.  (vs dreams and nightmares..doppies too if you would)

any way plant iton a buried corpse in the deepest forest for her to go find and dig up....we will do the rest ehheheheheh

thanks again bud
