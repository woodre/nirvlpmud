Preface:

   The first and greatest of the people of our calling- the Hunter, as
often called himself- was a man of great brilliance and foresight.  
Besides being the founder of our order, he showed the world that magic
was not a thing of chaos but rather a tangible thing that was delicately
balanced by rules of its own. How he learned these rules is yet a mystery.
What is known is that when he left those he cared for- the originators 
of that well known guild,the Bards- he left in disgust, stating that what
the bards did was not true magic, that they simply used it and did not SEE 
it.  He then went on and eventually our order was created.  <read the 
CHRONICLES to learn about the guild's history>.  
   So here is the first book he wrote, a basic and very important grimoire 
on the very thing that his life was spent upon- Magic.
