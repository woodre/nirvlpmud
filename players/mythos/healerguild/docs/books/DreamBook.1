Dream 1

  Velvet Darkness spreads far above.
  Blood spills upon the ground.
  Circles of the brightest white surround me and I am safe.
  
  A black crow caws out in the night.
  A mother's touch warms the cheek.
  The laughter of a baby seeks me out in this Circle of Light.
  
  Vision blurs and circle disappears.
  The blood of My Blood spills.
  I cry in the darkness of the night.
