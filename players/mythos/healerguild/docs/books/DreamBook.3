Dream 2

    I step upon the waters of a sparkling river.
    I do not sink.
    The waters accept me and hold me.
    
    I walk forward upon this blue path.
    It opens to a great ocean.
    And i hear the quiet sirens calling.
    
    I reach the middle of the ocean.
    A mermaid comes carrying a sword.
    Another comes carrying a staff.
    
    Then a great voice asks:
      To move on, to enter the grove of Purpose, choose.
      Choose your tool.
