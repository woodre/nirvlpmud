Preface:

  This work is unfortunately merely a fragment of one of the numerous
conversations that Rose and the Hunter had when Rose had finally found
him.  The writer is unknown, but it is my guess that it was one of
the many mechanical/demonic servants which the Hunter often used to
serve his needs.
