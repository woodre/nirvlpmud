  Advantages:
          Extremely powerful abilities in the area of healing
          
  DrawBacks:
          1> XP can only be gained through healing others.
             Combat will NOT be a way to advance.
             Also, to raise a stat costs 7000 xp.
             
          2> All spells have a spell failure.
             Spell failure will still expend the cost of that spell.
          
  Misc:
          1> Level advancement follows normal Nirvana system.
             Extra levels are added to normal level: levels 5 - 40 (19+21)
             
          2> Only a level 5 player may join
             Those above level 5 will be reduced to level 5.
