  Healers Guild (built in 3 days)
  
    by Mythos <Mas>
  
  Concept:  A guild with healing based powers.  
  
  DrawBacks:
  
       1> XP can only be gained through healing others.
          Combat will NOT be a way to advance.
          Partying as well will NOT be a way to gain xp.
          Also, to raise a stat costs 7000 xp.
          There are only a few spells that will allow for XP gain (see SPELLCHART.txt)
          Also see SPELL.txt for descriptions of spells
          
       2> All spells have a spall failure.
          Spell failure will still expend the cost of that spell.
          Se SPELLCHART.txt
          
       3> Spell costs are expensive as they increase in power.
          The basic spells cost only sp and somtimes hp
          The better spells may additionally cost XP or coinage
          See SPELLCHART.txt 
          
  Advantages:
   
          Nonconventional heals and healing ability
           Spells do not follow the guidelines (see SPELL.txt and SPELLCHART.txt)
           And some may even seem ridiculous in power.
           HOWEVER, check cost as the most powerful costs XP.
   
  Misc:
      
          1> Level advancement follows normal Nirvana system.
             Extra levels are added to normal level: levels 5 - 40 (19+21)
          2> Spells are gained as level increases:       
              2 spells at level 5
              1 spell per level between levels 6 - 20 (19+1)
              1 spell at levels 22 (19+3), 25 (19+6), 30 (19+11),
                                35 (19+16), 39 (19+20), and 40 (19+21)
          3> Only a level 5 player may join
             Those above level 5 get reduced to level 5.
          4> Low-Maintenance guild
