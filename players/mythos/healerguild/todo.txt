Healers to-do list:
------------------
fortify - this spell doesn't work with the new armor code...My solution
          was to make an invisible shield that the player wears
shield spell - bad implementation...My solution was to reimplement it
               using the resistance code
reinstate - no cap on stats...There's no current system for keeping
            track of the max stats that a guild can have, so I changed
            it to a temporary stat bonus that wears off after an hour
            or so. Also, made the cost less.
cove - This spell wasn't efficient...Healers had no reason to cast it,
       so I fiddled with it so they might cast it occasionally.
holy blessing - You were here for that conversation...Softly suggested
                that the time not be reduced if its cast on a healer,
                because healers have little offensive power.

I had some other plans for changes to healers as a result of my
conversations with Softly...

1. Reduce the amount of tox that high-level healers give.  Apparently,
high-level healers can't heal newbies at all because they get too
toxed.

2. Let healers be able to heal more at a single time, but also allow
them to set how much they can heal.  For example, make a level 5 able
to heal up to 10 hp/sp, but they can set the healing amount to 2 if
they really want to.
