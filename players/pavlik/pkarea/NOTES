Basic Concept:
----------------
Create a PK-Sparring Area were players must remove all objects and money before
entering (this includes Guild Objects, Quicktypers, Etc...).  Players will recieve
a weapon and a small amount of coins upon entering the realm.

Removal of Objects:
--------------------
ALL objects except for the soul will be removed from the player before entering the
realm.  This includes guild objects, quicktypers, etc.  I must make sure that desting
a players guild object will not incur anything more than inconvienance for the player.
Players are responsible for reaquiring lost items after they leave the area.  If possible
I will create a room where they can register to regain guild object, quicktyper, star tatoo
and such various items.

Objects within the Realm:
---------------------------
Players may only have objects that are approved for the realm.  Each room init() will scan
the players inventory and dest any object that does not have the required flag.  This is to
prevent illegal objects being "delivered" to a player in the realm.

All weapons/armor/money/heals/etc are aquired within the realm and usable only within the
realm.  These objects will be "cashed in" or dested when the player leaves.

Quitting / Disconnection:
--------------------------
Gonna take some time and play-testing to figure out what kind of effects quitting or
disconnections are going to have in an area of this type.

Special Libs:
----------------
Thinking of incorporating special armor and weapon libs to allow for different damage
types.  This will help break away from a one-dimensional "Hack & Slash" combat.

Player Daemon Object:
----------------------
Each player will be carrying an invisible daemon object to help control specific
needs of the area.  The daemon object will block the basic "fireball" and "sonic"
spell commands.
