messages "Sun Aug 19	 | Mage bugs (Squint):**It would be nice if mages who find bugsin the guild would report, rather then exploit them.  I know this seems likea silly request, but as we are just out of beta more or less...reportingbugs would be the thing to do. AnyMage exploiting bugs in the future will find themselves being demotedto a level novice. I doubt that would be worth the cheat. So don't.**Sat Sep 22	 | careful (Squint):**apply sphere some mages were sort of cheating by enteringa room and casting spells, leaving the room, entering,blah blah blah....certain code was added so if we cast spells, it will take a round to clear you toleave the room.  It will say something like...'you are too busy casting spells'. Only aftera round of combat has passed will you be able toleave the room, or disingage from combat. So...be careful not to get too close to dead beforeyou leave a room to stop combat. Just a warning.**Mon Oct 29	 | Teferi was banned from the guild. (Vertebraker):**For cheating.This is long overdue.**Sat Nov 24	 | space grubs (Squint):**A nice heal for mages. Part food, part intox. They are found in deep space...from acapsule in the glade out of warp.**Fri Feb 	 | Skill/Spell conversion (Corwin):**I beg upon the Gods to create a method of turning training points into spell points, and visa-versa. Even is it is a 10 to 1 conversion. hehLord Corwin**Mon Feb 11	 | Possible calcxp bug (Bloodhound):**I'm not quite sure if this is a bug or not but I thought I better point it out.  calcxp will takeall xp gained from you even if you have advanced levels. For example yesterday I fought to get to level14, advanced and then advanced my guild levels.  Went out and killed some more and did a calcxpto have it take about 300k xp and drop me back down to level 13.  Not sure if it is meantto be like this but it would be nice if it would not take enough xp away from you to dropyou from your current level if you have recently advanced.Bloodhound**Tue Apr 29	 | Save Issues (Fred):**Hey all.  I realize that there are sometimes issuedswith your dragons saving.  I'm looking into that yet.There's also issues with some guild stuff saving.I'm also looking into that heh.For now until I get a chance to edit some stuff afteryou are done gaining a spell, increasing a stat, or anythingmore guild related like that you can force a savewith the 'renew' command.  Thanks.Fred**Mon May 	 | Mage vs. Mage (Squint):**We have recently had an incidence of one Mage killing another Mage. There are no real rules to restrict Mages from doing anything they wish.However, here is what my take on Mage vs. Mage should be...The battle should NOT take place in the guild hall.  The guild hallshould be a safe place for all Mages.  If any disagree with me on this,please make your views known here on the board. Unless there is a verycompelling reason given why our guild should be a killing ground...it willbe considered a safe zone for ALL mages from this point forward. 05/05/08**Tue May 	 | Killing in Guild Hall (Squint):**Anyone who kills another mage in the guild hallwill be dismissed from the guild.  There will be noappeal and no excuse. This is hard and fast. All magesshould feel safe in the Guild Hall.**Sat Jul 31	 | new dragon command (Mode):**There is a new command: "xferxp"This will transfer a specified amount of xp to guid xp which you can then use.This was designed by Mizan to solve some issues with the "calcxp" command.**Mon Mar 28	 | Private quarters (Narlav):**Does anyone know how to go into the private quarters of all the spell trainers? I am tempted to kill one of em, well try to anyway, and see if that works but I dont know if that will remove me from the guild or not. Any thoughts?**Fri May 20	 | re:Private quarters (Equilibrium):**Type your name when your there.**Sat May 28	 | re: re:Private Quarters (Narlav):**You misunderstood the question. I know about the player private rooms, I am talking about the NPC private quarters. The rooms that show an exit but will not allow you to pass.**Sat May 28	 | re: re: re:Private Quarters (Hadus):**I vote to lay waste to em!**Sun Mar 24	 | Dragon (Legacy):**If you would like to add xp to the guild for your dragon after you are max you can do so byusingxferxp xferxp and then using the amount.  Gdiv does not work after you guild max so this is the work around.**Thu Mar 28	 | msc (Dragnar):**I have enhanced the msc command to make it easier to track your guild bonus.Please let me know if you run into any issues.Thanks.--Dragnar**Mon Apr 	 | exchange (Dragnar):**Mages now have the ability to exchange training sessions for spell chances.

Pleaselet me know if you have any issues.  Also, when you kill a mob whileusing mimage, you should now get the normal message with the amount of expgain and exp needed for the next level.  As many of you have noted, if youuse a party object you will lose part of the exp because you are not tanking.You can also 'dispell image' to get rid of your mimage if you wish.--Dragnar**Wed Apr 17	 | Mage gear (Dragnar):**Rumor has it there are some additional mage gear items in Nirvana.Hopefully more to come as well.--Dragnar**Fri Aug 	 | tlp (Dragnar):**The spell tlp has been modified slightly.

Partieswill no longer loose exp if the leader is a mage using mimage.However the leader will not get the xp bonus for leadingthe fight. There will be no exp loss and it will beshared evenly with everyone in the party.Let me know if you see any issues.--Gnar**Mon Jul 21	 | mequip (Marlboro):**would be nice when using Mequip if it also showed the mage stats it gave pluses and minus too and how many.lookexample:  Chest: Shadowveil [Illus +++]just my 2 cents worth,Marlboro...**Wed Aug 20	 | Monitor (Dragnar):**If you perfer to use the regular monitor over mmon,you can now add your mage spells to the normal monitor.Just use #g1# when using the setmon command. If youhave ideas on other things to show on the monitorlet me know.Thanks,--Gnar**Sun Aug 24	 | WTH?? (Haystak):**The last time I logged off this character I was lvl 15. I log back into this character to be set back to lvl 13. WTH?? If I did something wrong or ifthis is normal please let me know and I will quit even trying to do anythingwith this character.**Mon Aug 25	 | calcxp (Incendius):**Haystak - it sounds like you did the same thing I did the other day.  If you gdiv a percentage of your exp to the guild, the guild will keep track of that percentage and transfer it to the guild when you calcxp.  However, if you use that exp to level, calcxp does not take that into account and will still convert the percentage of your exp gained since you set your gdiv (or your last calcxp).  So, even if you level, there is a chance that calcxp will transfer exp to the guild that will put your total exp below your current level.  Now, I usually calcxp right before I level to make sure I don't drop below my current level the next time I tranfer exp to the guild.**Wed Aug 27	 | gm (Dragnar):**I added some new destinations for the gm command in the tower.If you think of more just let me know and I can add them.--GnarPS just type gm for a list of locations.**Fri Sep 19	 | Mage Gear (Dragnar):**No longer will killing mobs that have gear with a Mage bonuscause the tank to have a negative guild bonus.--Gnar**Wed Feb 18	 | Monitor #2 (Dragnar):**I have added the ability to track your dragons hps onthe regular monitor.
