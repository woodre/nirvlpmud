 -=[ Calculate Experience ]=-

There are two ways to have your experience transfer from general mud
experience to guild experience.

The first way is to let it transfer automatically.  Each time the automatic
guild save occurs it transfers a portion of the new experience you've 
gained based on your 'gdiv' percentage.

The second way is to manually do it.  Whenever you want to transfer the
experience you've gained (based on your 'gdiv' percentage) you can just
type 'calcxp'.
