-=[ NEXT_<spell> ]=-

Spells are often divided into 4 different casting types: protection,
damage, healing, and alteration.  Sometimes there is a delay before
you can cast a specific casting group again.  This delay is indicated
on your Mage Score with the Next_<spell> flag.  You cannot cast another
spell of the same casting type until the listed time expires.
Spell types and delays are listed in the individual help files.
