 -=[ Learning New Spells ]=-

As you advance through the guild you will earn the chance to learn new
spells.  These chances or 'new spell slots' are required by the masters
of the tower to learn new spells.  

To see what spells a Master can teach and how many slots they require
you must locate the Master within the Tower and then examine what the
Master is holding.  The cost to learn the spell is equal to that spells
level of casting.

To have the Master teach you the spell do: say teach <spellname>
<spellname> is the spells command word (often displayed in []'s)

If you try to raise spells before the corresponding attrib/stat
is raised to 99, the spell learning will FAIL and you lose the spell learning
point!
