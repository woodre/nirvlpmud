-=[ Mage Guild Info ]=-

The Mage guild promotes the role-playing atmopshere of the classic
Magic-User class.  A Mage believes that ultimate power is the
only true goal in life and that goal can only be achieved through
the relentless pursuit of Magic.

Mages can have no other ties to other guilds, a Mage lives for the
persuit of power and nothing else. Please remove any other bonds
you have to other guilds before trying to join.

The requirements to join the Mage guild are as follows:
1. Must be at least level 6
2. Must have sufficient intelligence and magic ability.
3. You must find a current Mage guild member to sponsor you.
4. A Mage must gain experience using their new Mage powers, so any
   excess experience should be used by leveling up before you join.
   BE WARNED, EXCESS EXPERIENCE WILL BE FORFEITED WHEN YOU JOIN.
