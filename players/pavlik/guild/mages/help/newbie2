(mhelp newbie2)

   To train in a stat or school of magic simply find the npc that (train)
it and type (say train stat name) You will notice that your stat will
increase a random % rating. Use the command (msc) to see your guild
score. Guild stats have the ability to increase this percentage each
time you train so read the (mhelp) files closely.

   As for spells you must (look at items) that certain npcs have on them.
They will give you a list of spells that you can learn at your guild rank.
You simply type ’say teach spell name’ to learn that spell. I would 
suggest that you use (mhelp spell name) to learn about spells before you
choose them. You only have a certain number of spell slots that you are
given, and you will NOT beable to learn every spell, this is the appeal
of the mages. Each mage is unique in the end. Use the (spells) command
to see a full list of your spells that you have learned.

4. Mages can cast spells more then once a round, and switching what kind
of spell you cast in combat is very fun and important for a mage. Be
mindful of spells that require material components and keep track of them
in your inventory. The Zinctal shop has all the components you will ever
need.

5. Finally ask other mages what set up works best for them. See what works
and what does not. Be respectful of mages who are higher in guild rank
then you, you will need them to rank up at certain levels. They are your
masters so treat them accordingly. Above all have fun and roleplay.

   Mages are a strong role-play guild with the seeking of power as their top
goal. We are neutral in the realms, so you may be in any alliance you wish,
as long as you respect your fellow mage.
