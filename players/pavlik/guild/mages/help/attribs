-=[ Mage Attributes ]=-

There are certain Attributes which are particular only to the Mages Guild.
They are completely independent of the regular mud attributes.  Mage
Attributes range from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best.  High guild attribs
can increase the power, duration and effectiveness of a spell.

Guild Attribs may be modified by certain spells or objects.  A modified
stat may have a '+' or '-' next to it when listed on your mage score.

Below is a brief description of how each Attribute affects you:

Intelligence:      # of training sessions gained each level
                   chance of learning a new spell sucessfully

Wisdom:            % pts gained when training a guild attribute

Power:             # of new spell chances gained each level
                   increased spell point recovery

Will Power:        % pts gained when training school stat
