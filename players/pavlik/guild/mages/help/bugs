-=[ BUGS ]=-

Please report anything you believe to be a bug immediately!  You can
mud-mail me or type 'bug <bug>' / 'typo <typo>' using the normal mud
commands

Abusing bugs will NOT be tolerated.  Anyone caught doing so runs the
risk of having your character erased.

Note: It is not uncommon for me to bestow gifts upon those that report
bugs or glitches concerning my guild.

Thank You,
     Vertebraker
