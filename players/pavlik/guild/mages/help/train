 -=[ Training ]=-

Training is an essential part of a Mages life.  Through ardous training
of the mind and spirit a Mage is able to excel in the powers of magic.

As you advance in guild rank you will recieve 'training points'.  The
training points are used to raise your guild stats and attributes.  To
train an attribute or stat you must locate the proper Master within the
Mages Tower.

Once you have located the proper Master simply: say train <stat>
to have the Master train you.

You must train your stats and attributes to be able to learn
spells effectively.
