dragon_descrip "kraknarok#the#roars#Kraknarok is the only hatchling of the dragon Plaguewind, former mount ofMortarion.  His scales are a glossy black with a slight green sheen to them.  His eyes glow with a deep red light and give just a hint of themalice that lurks within.  His great fanged maw is filled with razor sharpfangs as a sulfuric stream drifts out of his nostrils and lazily coilsupward to the sky."
