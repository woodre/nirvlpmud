dragon_descrip "shriake#the#stomps#Shriake looks at you and puffs out a thick black cloud of smoke towards yourface. Looking at this large beast the first thing noticable is his claws,black tipped, about as long as a man is tall and sharp enoughto even impale whatever it feels. His scales are obsidiancolored and his wings lay folded against his back unused at themoment. Lastly looking into this beast's face you see the true horor...as his black eyes with red iris glares stonely at you.His fangs dripping with black fluid and it is definatlyfelt that touching such fluid would be lethal."
