descrip "This is the room of the greatest mage to of graced the lands with his presence. The walls are made of wood and stained to preserve the wood, it also has a very slight glow which is something Xehanort added to enhanse the preservation. Along the walls you see bookshelves, some holding novels where others must be magic as they arent touchable without having magic. On the North wall theres a huge fireplace about 12 feet wide with a large piece of a tree trunk slowly burning inside it giving off a warm gentle glow. The ceiling is about two stories high giving room for many trophies and items. Several heads are seen throughout on the wall and in the corner theres a full sized bear trophie in pristine condition. In front of the fireplace you see a huge comfortable chair and an elaborate rug underneath it. This is truely a home for a Legend."
