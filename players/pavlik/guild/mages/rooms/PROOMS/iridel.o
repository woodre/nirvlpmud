owner "iridel"
descrip "As you enter into the Iridel's bedroom you can't help but to notice how gloomy everything looks. Dust litters everything in sight as if no one has lived here in a very long long time yet you know someone at least sleeps here due to the well kept bed. The open window may have provided a glow had not the clouds been lazily floating by. There is a picture of a very dark and foreboding looking man with a slightly shorter young woman. You do not know the man but you immediatly recognize the woman as a much younger Iridel. The man must have been her husband. You soon realize that this is more of a tomb than a bedroom."
