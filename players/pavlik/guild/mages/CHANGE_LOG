2006-04-28:
	Added macro for ARMOR_PHYSICAL_PENALTY
	Changed value from -20 to -10

2006-04-26:
	Added 'mspells' command - administrative command to display a players
	spell list and also shows how many times they have used each spell during
	the current login session.

	Removed the half-assed 'mindstorm' spell.  Still searching for the last
	level 6 spell to be added (type: illusion).

2006-04-24:
	Moved autosave function from guild-daemon.c to gob.c
	This makes guild-daemon.c completely obselete and should be
	ready for removal.
