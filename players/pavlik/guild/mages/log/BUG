[May 15 21:49] Squint /players/pavlik/guild/mages/room/summon_room : I don't know if I logged this...but we have no way (that I know of) to 'heal' our dragons spell pts....I suggest a corpse 'feed dragon' command for spell pts.  We can use 'cure' to heal their hit pts. :)
[May 15 22:23] Squint /players/snow/ROOMS/death/cold2 : Our dragon stops following at times...wierd times.
[May 15 22:49] Squint /players/arrina/tunnel/tunnel4 : Ok..we need a 'summon dragon' command to get our dragon back once it f'n stops following us...who the hell can keep track of a damn dragon and where it stops following?
[May 17 23:54] Squint /players/pavlik/guild/mages/room/mage_shop : I think we should make item#3 in the Zinctal shop just sulfur...not sulfur powder. It might conflict with granite 'powder' otherwise. Just a suggestion. I'd also suggest changing granite 'powder' to granite 'dust'. (for the same reason.) Then the only 'powder' would be the onyx powder.
