-=[ Donations ]=-

Mages are encouraged to make donations to the guild.  A guild member earns
donation points when they deposit either money or objects into the
Guild Vault (located in the Mages Tower).  The Mage (curerntly on-line)
with the highest donation points will recieve a 10% bonus to all experience
earned.  This persons name will appear in all capital letter on the guild who.
The second highest donation leader will recieve a 5% bonus.

If your donations points exceed 50,000 you will automatically recieve a
guild exp bonus and your donations will drop by approximately 1/2.

You can view the donation standings at any time with the 'dlead' command.
