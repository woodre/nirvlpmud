-=[ Mages Tower ]=-

The Mages Tower is the home of the Mages Guild (that makes sense).  All
the needs of the guild can be found within the tower.  Every guild member
has the innate ability to teleport freely inside the tower.  The only
way to truly learn the Tower is to wander its halls.

- Type 'gm' while inside the Tower for details
- 'gm who' will list all Mages located in the Tower
- 'gm <player>' will teleport you to that person
