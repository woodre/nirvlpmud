-=[ Starting Over ]=-

This file is a courtesy to my guild member and its purpose is to help
you get used to the new guild system.  I will assume that you have already
read 'mhelp guild_reset' ...

-Advancing Guild Rank:
  Goto Calador, he still does what he used to with the one exception:  
Calador no longer teaches you spells.  When you advance in rank you will
earn 'new spell chances' which are used by the other Masters of the guild.
You will still need to have another Mage train you for the highest rank
of an Order (Master of Earth, etc...)  You will _not_ have to get a 2nd
sponsorship at guild rank 20.

-Learning New Spells:
  Find the Spell Masters within the tower.  There are 3 of them.  When you
find one, examine the object in his hand and you will see what spells you
can learn from him.  To learn a spell just: say teach <spellname>
You must have enough new spell chances to cover the cost.
