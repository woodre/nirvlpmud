-=[ GUILD RESET ]=-

This file describes how to update your Mage Soul to the new guild system.
Please read this note carefully before going on.  When you update your
Mage Soul the following things will happen:
1) you will lose all guild rank.
2) you will lose all guild stats (however you will be reimbursed with
   guild expierence when they are reset to 0).
3) you will lose all your spells.
4) you will RETAIN your total guild expierence.
Because your guild experience has not decreased you can immediately
advance to your old guild rank.  Advancing under the new system will
take a little bit more time because of the new procedure for learning
spells and training stats.  These new procedures are explained in
'mhelp starting_over'

To update your Mage Soul, goto Tamuli (gm join) and type 'RESET'
