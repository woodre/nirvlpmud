This is just a short notice about recent things added to the Mage's Dragon:

Dragon Level: # of Spells / Spell effectivness
Stamina: # Hit Points / Healing Rate
Magic: # of Spell Points / SP Recovery Rate / Spell effectivness
Attack: Dragon Weapon Class
Defense: Dragon Armor Class

Level is important as it is checked as a modifier for just about everything
the dragon does.  High level dragons have been known to use powerful
spells such as Cyclone, Lightningbolt and even Blister.
