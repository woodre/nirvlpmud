-=[ Hints ]=-

Here are a few helpful hints that I have collected when Beta testing
the guild system.  Hopefully these will be of some help:

1) ***important***: the guild was purposefully designed so that you will
   not be able to learn _every_ spell or max _every_ stat.  Choose which
   stats and spells are most important to you and be selective.

2) Power is an important stat but it doesn't really affect anything until
   higher guild ranks.  Don't completely ignore this stat, but you can
   work on raising the others first.

3) Intelligence is a primary stat, make sure you raise it steadily.

4) ALWAYS train your stats before trying to learn spells.  There is a
   chance you may FAIL to learn a new spell, having higher stats will
   give you a much better chance.

5) don't get worried over low stats at low guild ranks.  5% is not a bad stat
   if you are still under rank 10.  your stats will improve as your guild rank
   gets higher, do be patient.
