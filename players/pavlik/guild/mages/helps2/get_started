-=[ GETTING STARTED ]=-

Welcome to the Mages Guild!  There are a few things you should do to
get started here in our guild.  Here are a few hints of what to do
first:

-} Check out the extensive help files with the 'mhelp' command.
-} Get famaliar with the guild stats with the 'msc' (mage score) command.
-} Type 'commands basic' to view list of the basic commands of the guild.
-} You will need to go earn 500 guild xp for your first guild rank.  Once
   you have gotten it, go into the Mages tower and find Calador.  He will
   advance your guild rank and give you your chance to learn new spells.
-} Don't forget to train your guild stats as you go!
-} If you need any help check the mhelp files first or ask another guild
   member!
