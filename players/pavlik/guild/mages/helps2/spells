-=[ Mage Spells ]=-

Spells are obiously the center of a Mage's being.  We aquire power
and fame through the masterful art of Magic.  Aquiring spells is
not an easy task and spell casting in fact quite dangerous, however
if you have dedicated yourself to the power of Magic you will conquer
these obstacles and more.

Each specific spell has its own help file, which you can access with
'mhelp <spellname>'.  There is no singular list of every spell.  You
can get partial lists by examining the Masters within the Tower.
