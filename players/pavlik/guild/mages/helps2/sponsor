-=[ Sponsor ]=-

Any player who wishes to join the Mages Guild must be sponsored by
a current member.  Once a sponsorship has been achieved the player
is eligible to join.  If you are going to sponsor someone _make sure_
it is someone you feel is worthy to be a member of this guild.
** You will be responsible for that persons actions until they have
reached guild rank 30**

A mage earns the chance to sponsor a person at guild rank 69.
  
Note: A prospective mage must have an intelligence and magic of
      20 in order to join.
