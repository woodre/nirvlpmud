-=[ Spell Damage ]=-

Most spells will give an indication of how much damage was done.
The messages from weakest damage to highest damage are:

ANNIHILATES
devastates
crushes
pulverises
smashes
hits
nicks
annoys

Note: Annihilates are _extremely_ rare and should be consider a miracle
      when recieved, so don't get upset if you don't see it very often.
      Even devestates messages should be rare.
