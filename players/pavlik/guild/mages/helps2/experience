 -=[ Guild Experience ]=-

Guild Experience is required to advance through the ranks of the Guild.
Your guild experience is added automatically when you earn regular experience
points.  The amount of regular experience points converted to guild
experience is determined by your ~Division setting.

The default ~Division setting is 50% (1/2 of all regular experience is
translated to guild experience).  You will gain the ability to modify
the ~Division element when you progress through the guild ranks.
