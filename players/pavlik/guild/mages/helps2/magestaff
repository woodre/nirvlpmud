-=[ Mage Staff ]=-

The Mage Staff is a powerful and very useful weapon for any Mage.
This enchanted Staff has the ability to autocast your guild spells
when you are in combat.

You can only summon a Mage staff from within the Mages Tower and
it will cost 250 spell points to create it.  Once you have created
the staff it will stay with you until you leave the game.
