Mages have the unique ability to put themselves right into action as
soon as they enter the game.  Mages can define a set of Login Commands
that are executed as soon as you login.
You can have up to 5 commands in your login string

- Use 'lcmds <commands>' to set up your commands
- Use 'lcmds?' to see what commands you have set
- Use 'lcmds none' to clear all login commands.

Example:
