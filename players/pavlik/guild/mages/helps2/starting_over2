-=[ Starting Over (con't) ]=-

-Raising Guild Stats:
  Works exactly the same as learning new spells.  The same masters who
teach you spells can train your Guild Stats (conj, evoc, etc).  Buepaya
and Jhavostrahd will train your Guild Attributes (int, wis, etc).
When you locate one of them just: say train <stat> to raise the guild stat.
It costs 1 training session to train a stat.

Use the mhelp files that have been provided.  Everything should be
explained in detail.  If you need further help ask another guild member
or contact me.  Make sure read 'mhelp attribs' to see what affects the
different guild attributes have.

I have included some helpful suggestions in 'mhelp hints'.  Check it out.

Thanks to everyone for their help,....
