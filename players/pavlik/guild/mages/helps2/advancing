 -=[ Advancing in the Guild ]=-

Once you have aquired the minimum guild experience for the next guild rank
you can advance.  There is two possible ways to advance your guild rank:

1) Seek Calador the Mage within the Mage's Tower.  Calador will advance
   your guild rank and give you valuable Traning Sessions and New Spell slots.

2) Ask another Mage of higher guild rank to train you.  **If you are ready
   to advance to the Master Status of an Order you must have another Guild
   Member train you.  The Guild Member must be at least the rank you wish
   to advance to.

As you advance through the guild you will earn the chance to learn new
spells and abilities.  You will have to seek out the other Masters of the
Tower to train you and teach you new spells.
