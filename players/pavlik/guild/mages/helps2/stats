-=[ Mage Stats ]=-

Stats reflect how effective a Mage is within a particular school of Magic.
Guild Stats range from 0 to 99, with 99 being the best.  High guild
stats can increase the power, duration and effectiveness of a spell.
Guild Stats may be modified by certain spells or objects.  A modified
stat may have a '+' or '-' next to it when listed on your mage score.

If you try to raise spells before the corresponding attrib/stats
raised raised to 99, the spell learning MAY FAIL and you MAY LOSE the spell learning
points!
