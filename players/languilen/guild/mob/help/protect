   ABILITY:  protect <player>
   LEVEL:    Muscle
   COST:     Low graft

   DESCRIPTION:
     Offer protection to <player> for a set time period in
     return for a payment.  The larger the payment made by
     the player, the longer the protection lasts.  A protected
     player is immune to grafting by the family to which
     payment was made.  Players who make protection payments
     on a regular basis are usually given preferred treatment
     by the receiving family.
