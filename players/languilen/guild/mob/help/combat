COMBAT:
  In keeping with the mob theme, mobsters are not able to use any form
  of spells.  Combat for a mobster consists of his weapon and any
  combat abilities that he has acquired.  Mobsters may use any weapon,
  but may find it beneficial to use weapons that are consistent with
  the theme of the guild.  It also may be advantageous to fight with
  other members of your family.
