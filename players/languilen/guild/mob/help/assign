   ABILITY:  assign <boss> <territory>
   LEVEL:    Godfather
   COST:     High coins and high graft for <boss>

   DESCRIPTION:
     When the Godfather feels that the crime boss of a family
     is ready to handle his own territory, the Godfather may
     assign that area to him.  The don will have to make a 
     payment to the Godfather in exchange for the territory.
     When a territory is bought by a don it is considered to be
     his family's territory and an invasion for any mobster not
     in that family to graft there.
