GUILD WEAPON:

     The mobsters guild weapon is one of several guns of choice.
To start with only one will be availible but as the mobsters guild
level rises other guns will become availible to purchase at the shop.

      THE GUNS:

     .22 caliber pistol - Not a very powerfull weapon but it can
be deadly in the right hands.  Rounds are cheaper.

     .38 caliber pistol - The snub nose 'special' model.  Not a
very accurate gun but in close quarters it's a killer.

     .45 caliber pistol - A reliable powerfull hand gun.

     .44 caliber magnum - These magnum rounds pack a punch but
the gun is a bear to handle.

     The Thomson sub-machine gun.  AKA tommy gun.  Takes a drum
magazine of 45 caliber shells guaranteed to rip the guts out of
anyone dumb enough to get in the way!

     silencer - This may be added to the .22  (a hit man's choice)
