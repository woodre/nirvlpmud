    THE MOB
_________________________________________________________________________________

THEME:
     The guild is centered around the 1920's Capone era gangsters.  The
Guild should be role-played, it's abilities and structure are designed to
facilitate and possibly even necessitate active role-play.  Within the
Mob power and prestige is gained with graft money.

GUILD LEVEL ABILITIES:

     LEVEL 1: mob_help, mob, fam (members-only), brass(mi), block.

     LEVEL 2: eyeball, garrote, 

     LEVEL 3: extort, bagman(the pet),

     LEVEL 4: shoot?(replace sh), 

     LEVEL 5: kidnap, 

     LEVEL 6: molitov(fi), 

     LEVEL 7: blackmail, spray(so?), 


TITLE ABILITIES:

     GODFATHER: make, retire, unretire, assign, 

     DON: account, contract 

     LIEUTENANT: plate/meal, feast, 

     HITMAN: ice, contracts, trophy, 



GUILD WEAPON:
     The Thomson sub-machine gun.  AKA tommy gun.  Takes a drum
magazine of 45 caliber shells guaranteed to rip the guts out of
anyone dumb enough to get in the way!


GUILD PET:
     The guilds pet will take the form of a street punk.  a 'runner'
for the mobster.  He will not take part in combat.  Used to send
things to ppl and to carry stuff. (bagman).


GUILD HIERARCHY:
     Success in the Mob is measured in two parts, the common guild
level and the inner organizational 'title'.
     Guild levels are raised through the trade of graft and exp while
the mobsters title is is determined by a graft payment, availability
and the word of the Godfather/Don/Leiutenant respectively.
     Example guild levels are: Bullie, Thug, Muscle, Racketeer, Mobster,
Wiseguy.
     The titles are: Godfather (wiz), Don (Territorial Crime Boss),
Leiutenant, Hit-Man, Soldier.
     There are also two special designations: Made, and Retired.
To attack a made man in any family is to invite a contract from the
Godfather.  Made men who cause trouble are usually Retired to a boat
near some tropical island...

DISADVANTAGES:
     To be more than a soldier one must keep pk set.
     When a mobster dies they are returned to 'soldier'.
     Players may pk others in the guild.
     The amount of families and the measure of thier numbers are constant.

ADVANTAGES:
     The ability to garnish coins from other players.
________________________________________________________________________________

     As you can see this is not a presentation quality outline.  I just
slapped together some of the notes i have scribbled everywhere... There's
Some stuff about territories i'm leaving out but to give you a feel for
the result i had in mind;

GUILDAREA:
     The home of the Mob is a chicago city street.  Each 'Don' will
get a buisness on the street (mobsters are big on Italian restaurants,
brothels, nightclubs etc..).  The Godfather has his building at the end
of the road.
     Within the main room of each building there will be a table.  This
is where the Don or Leiutenant can make a 'feast' or a 'plate' for any
family member to enjoy.  There should also be a place for meetings and
a bulliten board though it could all go in one room.

     If we 'Make' only a very few chosen and respected ppl (only enough
so that half the Dons on the block are made) it should provide enough
revolving power to give most everyone interested a try at being the
Don of a crime family.

     It would seem that we have different ideas about many things...
We both seem interested in pk though :)  The way this is set up
will require some activity by the wizards responsible acting as the
godfather to accept/promote others into the Don position and to
sell the rights to specific territories. (Automation may be possible)


I could keep going but i won't.  This should be enough to decide
what/if/how/where to go from here.  I like very much your attack
spells and was wondering myself how to work in a drive_by.  The
picture of a guy hanging off the running-boards of an old model-T
with the muzzle of his tommy gun blazing rules.  Then again, those
crips can sure light up the corner with those uzzi's...

In any case, i'm sure we can work something out.  Drop me a note and
tell me what you think.
