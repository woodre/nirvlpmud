GUILD AREA:
     The home of the Mob is a chicago city street.  Each 'Don' will
get a restaurant on the street .  The Godfather has his building at
the end of the road.

   135          Key:  G   the godfathers place.
  G----*              #   Families places.
   246                *   The way out.

     Under consideration-  Should we let the don's pay to add room(s)
to thier resturantes? (ie: an office, a store room)  This adds a few
questions... Will we make it a 'safe room' where only family members
are allowed?  I'm not sure we want to allow them to hide.  Along the
same vein we could also sell them 'doormen' as guards.  These added
perks will also help to keep the graft levels of the don's down at a
reasonable level.


TERRITORIES:
     The territorial nature of the mob mainly effects block and
intimidate/protect/extort.
     In the beginning all territories are considered 'owned' by the
Godfather.  The Godfather imposes NO restrictions on the use of his
property so ANY mobster may graft there.
     When a territory (a room) is bought by a don it is considered
his families territory and an 'invasion' for any mobster not in that
family to graft there.  When a non family mobster attempts to graft
there a msg will be sent over the owning families channel telling
them that thier territory has been invaded.  This will undoubtedly
make the invader a target and will be very dangerous to those without
good family support.  Those with the support of thier family may
find both families in an all out territorial dispute.
