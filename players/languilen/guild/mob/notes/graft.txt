GRAFT:
     The definition of graft- The act of gaining personal advantage
or profit by dishonest or unfair means, especially through political
connections.

GRAFT ABILITIES:
   - Block <dir> This will stop any player attempting to leave
     <dir> and inform them that to do so they must 'pay <mobster>'.
     ie: Whoaa there!  If you wanna go that way, you gotta pay!
     But i'm only askin' <###> coins, whaddaya' say?  <Y or N>:

     There ae several rules that govern the use of this ability.
   1) The player blocking the exit must remain in that room.
   2) The mobster may only block one exit at a time.
   3) The mobster may not block an exit blocked by another mobster.
   4) Players in combat (or whimpying) are not affected.
   4) May not be used in any room in the /room/ dir.
   5) May not be used in the locker area.
   6) May not be used in other guild halls.
   7) See below -Basic Graft-


   - extort <player> / protect <player> / intimidate <player> - Forces a
player to fork over some cash.  ie: <mobster> pushes you up against a
wall and growls 'gimmie your money or else punk!' - or somesuch.  This
method should be considered a week version of blackmail except the victem
must be in the same room with the mobster.

     Blackmail- Can be done to anyone anywhere. (only once per boot?)

 
BASIC GRAFT:
     Much like players exchange exp for guild experience mobsters
exchange coins for graft.  Yes there is a catch!  Players may not
exchange coins for graft directly, they must use the guild methods
availible.  Money gained through grafting is devided and distributed
among the family leaders. See below -graft distribution table-

     Some of the rules regarding grafting:
1) Players under level 6 will not be affected. (when using block <dir>
   newbies with less than 1k will be GIVEN coins instead)
2) Graft abilities directed at a player cannot be used when the target
   is in combat.
3) Graft may NOT be exchanged for coins.


Here are some average coin statistics from the mud.  Just to put you in the mood...

 LEV AVG(MONEY)

   2  5296.925         12 32748.293
   3 16654.823         13 41412.4622
   4 14139.4085        14 41769.0272

  10 29030.8614

     Extortion/Blackmail levels:
This is the first table i made to represent possible graft percentages.
Because newbie levels aren't used i simply used the formula:
 (LEV-4)% * coins = graft%
to come up with a 2%-15% range.  This formula uses the TARGETS level.
so  Target level     target's coins:   1k        10k        50k        80k
           6   (2%)                    20        200        1000       1600
          14   (10%)                  100        1000       5000       8000
          19+  (15%)                  150        1500       7500      12000

After considering this chart i think it should reflect an overall picture
of all of the graft abilities.

GRAFT DISTRIBUTION TABLE:
     Godfather   25%
     Don         25%
     Mobster     50%
If the mobster has not joined a family the don's portion is sent to the
godfather.   I have not decided whether or not to give the player a part
of the graft in coins.
