DISADVANTAGES:
     To be more than a soldier one must keep pk set.
     When a mobster dies they are returned to 'soldier' and thier graft
          is set to 0!
     Players may pk others in the guild.
     The amount of families and the measure of thier numbers are constant.
** These sound pretty good.  I also think making the guild 'no teleport' would
** fit well with the theme.  I don't understand the last disadvantage that you
** have listed.

     All i meant was there should be a finite number of families with a finite
amount of members allowed.  So, just out of the blue, say 6 families consisting
of no more than 1 don, 1 leiutenant, 2 hitmen and 10 soldiers. -see levels-

DISADVANTAGES:
  * All gangsters must be PK at all times.
  * Killing guild members in other gangs is allowed.
  * No teleporting.
  * Healing only from drugs and alcohol.
