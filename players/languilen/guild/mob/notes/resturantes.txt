RESTURANTES:

     Within the main room of each building there will be a table.  This
is where the Don or Leiutenant can make a 'feast' or a 'plate' for any
family member to enjoy.  There should also be a place for meetings and
a bulliten board though it could all go in one room.

** This sounds about right.  The details can be worked out later.

     Another possibility for the use of graft would be to allow the dons
to buy extra rooms here.  Also along those lines we could allow them to
purchase guards/henchmen for the resturante to stop players not enfamily
from entering.
