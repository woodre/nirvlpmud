Newbie heals:  
 1) these heals may only be used by players < level 7.
 2) these heals may only be used in the designated newbie areas.

Each of the following are 6 shots of 25/25 healing each.
The following costs are according to the guidelines in heal3.

   water [soak 10] cost 1200
   jerky [stuff 10] cost 1200
   cider [intox 10] cost 1200
   brandy [intox 6] cost 2250

  I believe because of the limits these heals have, and the fact that
newbies aren't able to make money as easily as big players, the costs
should be lowered.  1000 each for the first 3 and 1800 for the brandy
seem only fair to me.
  Idealy the availability of these heals would encourage more newbies
to kill npcs on their own, rather than party with big players and quickly
advance past the first stage of their character.
  Also, the whereabouts of newbie heals should be added to the newbie
book.  Not only mine, but all the heals which are intended to be used
by lower level players.

Problems:

There are 2 kinds of newbies, 'true' ones who know nothing of Nirvana or
maybe even muds in general, and 'fake' newbies, who probably have a few
other chars at +21.  Cheaper heals would be ideal for the true newbies,
however at the same time the fake ones would be using these heals giving
themselves what I would see as an unfair advantage.  

*Perhaps they couldn't use the heals if any attrib was > 18.  
*Or if the total xp spent on attribs was > 80k.
*Or the total xp they had was > 15k
*Maybe they could only be used by guildless newbies.
  [to prevent players putting xp into a guild as a newbie]

Other general ideas:  

*limit how far a stat can be raised by level, so that level 5 newbies
 can't have maxed stats
*limit the amount of armor a newbie can wear, by level
  [all though it is already somewhat limited by weight]
*limit the class of weapon a newbie can wield
