INFO:
  This is a 1 room area, seperate from my other areas.
  It connects to my castle from the north.
  It is easy access to encourage players to use it.
  It features once npc, dealer.c, who sells 4 heals and 2 detoxers.
  There are no special room features.
  Dealer features:
    All coins from purchases go to it.
    High heal rate random(30) each hb.
    High spell damage, 4% of 200 dmg.
    High hps, 1000 or so.
    Will take coins from the ground, check when someone arrives.
    Random chance 1:3000 and 1:50000 bad thing will occur when heals used.
    1:1500 == damage taken, chance of death.
    However there is a chance, that they will be spared, and get a
      heal_self(100) instead.  if(random("luc") >= 19)
    No limit to heal amounts.

  Heal stats:

   tox - heal amount - type - cost

1.  7,7      50 sp    stuff/soak  318
2.  7,7      50 hp    stuff/soak  318
3.  -7,-7    0        stuff/soak  280

  cost:  (50 * 100 * 2 / 3) - 15 == 318
  see heal_notes for price calculation info.
