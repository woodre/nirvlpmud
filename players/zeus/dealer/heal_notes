--- Some notes taken from /doc/build/RULES/heal1

 1 hp or sp healed = 2/3 of a normal heal point. 

 -All sobering items will cost 20 for the first -1 or -2 strength.
 each following -1 will cost 20 more coins.

 -Anything that sobers more than -15 will cost 10,000.

- Fixed location, consumed on site healing may be discounted.
  The total value of the heal may be discounted 15 coins from
  calculated table sale price or 1/2 the value whichever is less.

  Sobering items
   cost=#ofcharges*(cost_per_charge) until the total 
   sobering reaches 30, at which it must be above 10000.
   sobering items will have a weight equal to the number of charges.
