Penguin calls (vocalizations) are individually identifiable, allowing partners to
recognize ach other and also their chick.  This is important since the
members of a large colony of penguins are nearly indistinguishable on sight.
Research has identified difference in the calls of male and female emperor
penguins.  These differences probably function in courtship and mate
selection.

There are three main kinds of penguin calls:
a) the contact call is usually used at sea to assist in visual recognition of
colony members.  The contact call of emperor and king penguins can be
heard one kilometer.
b)  The display call is the most complex of all the calls and is used
between partners in a colony.  The call must convey information on territorial,
sexual, and individual recognition.
c) The threat call is the simplest and is used to defend a territory and warn
against predators.

The other big method of communication is "displays":
Penguins communicate by vocalizing and performing physical behaviors
called displays. They use many vocal and visual displays to communicate
nesting territories, mating information, nest relief rituals, partner and chick
recognition, and defense against intruders

Lots of good stuff on their senses and on their adaptations for water, etc.
