1. How old are you (if you say 9 days I'm not sponsoring you)?
2. How long have you been playing Nirvana?
3. How did you get started playing Nirvana?

4. What do you think of the Fallen Lands (primarily) and the
     Museum (subsequently)?  Be specific.  If you want, divide your
     comments into "as a player" and "as a wiz"
5. What do you think of PK?
6. What do you think about mudsex and/or mud relationships?

7. Why do you want to be a wizard on Nirvana?
8. Have you ever programmed before?
9. Do you understand the essentials of object oriented programming?
 - If not, do you have a desire to know, or would you prefer instead to
    code things, expand Nirvana, and not worry about understanding
    everything?  That is, if you even want to code.

If you have anything else you'd like to throw in, feel free.  My name is
Dan by the way.  I've been playing Nirvana since '96, although I've taken
a couple years off since then.  I would prefer it if you'd email me at
dan669@u.washington.edu rather than mudmail.  Do you actually know anything
about me?  Just curious :)  Talk to you soon,
