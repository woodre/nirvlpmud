Due to a recent conflict with a wizard and his reaction I'm going to ask you
to watch me closely when your on, since I am your beta tester. Although the
wizard who threatened 'to zap me for the heck of it' is probably your friend
to cause everyone else is and seems to think it's okay for him to do what he
wants. I've been fucked around with before by a wizard but couldn't prove it
so I got fucked, so I'm asking you to please please watch my back, since
apparently he plans to do something devious. Thanks for your time.

I am now barred from all of maledicta's areas because he took offense from one
thing I said. But what I don't understand is I wanted to help out but now I'm
getting it in the ass for even helping or suggesting something???? I'm really
confused and this mud leaves me baffeled as how to wizards can harass players
and nothing be done about it, or one can just decide he doesn't like you and
fuck you over and try and remove your alts from guilds, etc, etc. I'm really
tired of this and would appreciate it if perhaps you talked to BOltar because
this IS harassment, I don't care if he bars me from the area but he's taking
it out of hand bringing problems to my alts, saying he's gonna remove them
from guilds and zap me for the fun of it. Boltar thinks this behavior from
his wizards is fine so long as they do't do anything I guess, I'm really
confused, why with a mud with such a small playerbase do they shun you from
trying to help??? Depending upon what happens I may just leave if Maledicta
can just walk all over me and I have to kiss his ass in hopes he doesn't,
but if he does would anything happen to him?? I know a friend of mine here is
thinking of leaving because of this incident to, If you could give me some
support that would be great, but if not it's alright, I unsderstand, its just
how things go here on Nirvana.
