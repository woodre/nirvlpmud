Subj:   Possible bug

Date: Jul 29 00:14

Well I thought of a really lame cheat/bug. Haven't tested it, but if you were to
 make a macros where you  'kill(player), spells, run' then repeat the same thing

Not sure if it would work but that's be a really quick way to kill someone since
 you get the first hit and 1st round, plus your spells and you attack first agai
n, over and over.

Dood, I was just pointing out, you sent me a mail practically throwing an accuss
ation at me. I'm no fucking cheater, if you watched me you'd know. I was trying 
to point out to you something in hopes you could fix it to prevent more cheating
 cause I see a whole shit load of it. I don't appreciate the negative disrespect
ful feedback you gave me at all......
