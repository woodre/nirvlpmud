Someone says: Knights: Could have done a bang up job of leading
themselves, and probably been more successful today.
Problem: Wizards were too involved from the beginning, and
skipped the chain of command.  Shardaks:  Doing well with
leading themselves: Have all the abilities to do it, including execute.  If they
dont like a member, that member suffers.   Cybs: The guild
is ruined, no recovering it, might as well shut it down. 
Too many hands in the mixing of it, and the players don't
even say
Someone says: and the players don't even care.    Theme is everything:
Have a good theme, and ppl will rally to it.
