254: harem
255: who
256: ip
257: lick tally
258: ring Nothing, just checking your skin temperature.
259: tell potter no idea.
260: tell handy If you fuck with me I will jail you just for being an asshole.
261: tell handy And believe me, no wizzes will care.
262: tell handy I have not fucked with you.  I have asked you to respect the sam
e rules that every other player respects.  Apparantly that is too complicated fo
r your mind to grasp.
263: tell handy I started out being nice about it.  My mistake.  Apparantly you 
don't like that.  So now I won't bother anymore.
264: tell handy Just about everyone here is smarter than you.  You think your in
telligent because you can cast insults with the best of them.  All it has ever p
roven to anyone is that your an ass.  Not that you have any intelligence.
265: tell handy I already know I am not well liked, however if you ever want to 
see them on my side, watch what happens when you give me an excuse to nuke you.
266: tell handy You have been nothing but nasty to everyone you can be since you
 have been here.  The act gets old.  At some point in life, you must grow up.
267: tell handy Its really annoying that when I try to be nice about something I
 get a stupid 20 questions treatment, rather than simply an acknowledgement that
 you understand and that you will not make that mistake.  I could have imprisone
d you instantly, instead I chose to warn you and not pull the trigger.  So what 
do I get for it?  More patented Handy abuse.  This is why I am upset with you.  
You don't appreciate it even when people are on your side.
268: lick candy
269: tell candy NOt much.  Scrambling for a BSD expert right now.  Not easy to f
ind.
270: tell handy Why should I have to tell you anything of the sort?  The rule is
 plain.  Just follow it.  Stop acting like a child.  I didn't make the rules, yo
u can go quiz a senior wiz if you disagree with it.  Its only my job to enforce 
it.  Don't shoot the damn messenger, especially when he is being nice.
271: tell candy Shawn is getting married Saturday and will be gone on his honeym
oon till the end of the month.
272: tell candy And I need to produce results for the investers sooner than that
.  Or at least have a demonstration.
273: tell handy It dosen't really matter.  You have always been that way as long
 as I have known you.  I don't bother to dissect your mind.
274: tell candy hmmm....wanna chat?
275: tell candy I mean a phone call.  I have lots of phone cards.
276: tell handy Heck, lots of wizzes don't 'deserve' it.  ;>  Just look at Jaree
l.  Heck, even most our seniors cheated to get there, at least I didn't do that.
277: tell candy Either way works, I don't pay for the cards, friend of mine gets
 a ton of em for free when he does Red Cross missions.
278: tell candy I should have about 4000 to pay someone to get what I need done.

279: tell candy And its not that I need the project done by then, its that I nee
d to know I havo can do it when they decide to go ahead with it.
280: tell handy You think I'm trying to be the boss or something?
281: tell handy What difference it makes is that if I don't call you on it, and 
an asshole like Eurale notices, I get demoted.  Again.  Thats what matters to me
.  The rule itself you can take up with those up above, but its part of my dutie
s to handle such things if I know of them.  You could have lied and I never woul
d have known and I would not have cared.  But you admitted it to me and I had to
 do something.
282: tell candy The situation is that I need to be able to offer a timeline, and
 Shawn works full time and cannot dedicate the time needed to give me a stable t
imeline.
283: tell candy ICQ or MSN works fine for me.
284: tell candy Dosen't want to add you, what email addy you have on it?
285: tell handy Why do you think I am L40 right now?  Because according to a cer
tain previously mentioned senior wiz I did not handle a player issue properly.  
Fortunatly Mal bitched and the demotion is temporary, but the fact is that I hav
e a job to do.  I can't just be a buddy all the time.
286: tell handy In the grand scheme of things none of this matters.  However sin
ce you have decided to participate here you have to play by the rules establishe
d.  Its not that hard.
287: tell handy Such is life.  People are inconsistant.
288: tell handy And they don't appreiciate being called on that fact either.  ;>
289: finger handy
290: tell handy Join the club.  I have been very viscious about protecting the B
ards.  Namely, wizzes cannot clone the Bard obj.  It will dest itself and tell t
hem to talk to me if they try.
291: tell handy I am tired of pseudo equality, the mud will never be truly balan
ced, its an impossible goal.
292: laugh handy
293: tell handy I have read it, every so often I go over the logs.
294: tell handy No, but I remember noticing that a while back.  ;>
