Zeus says: yeah but the details are important
->> Caelin nods solemnly.
Caelin says: It's an overall thing

Zeus says: if the ride is going to take 3 hours, maybe you should go back to the
 hotel and have some fun instead
->> Caelin says: Another person defines it as: when I think about 'her' more
times in a day than I think about myself

You nod solemnly at Caelin.
->> Caelin says: Now, assuming that to be in love with someone, you care more
about their happiness...

Caelin says: Reconsider your and Gemma's positions

Zeus says: our relationship?
->> Caelin says: I mean your positions on sex, exploration, etc.

Zeus says: neither of us care more about the others' happiness?
->> Caelin says: ah

Caelin chuckles politely.
Caelin says: I don't have 'the right' answer

Caelin says: I know what I think...but what's most important is you
working through what you think and what makes you happy

Armageddon shouts: Game reboot in 10 minutes .
You nudge Caelin.
->> Caelin asks: Yes?

Zeus says: if anything I've advocated that she care more about her own happiness
 than mine
->> Caelin says: That's because she has emotional problems that she needs to
deal with.  Her caring about you isn't healthy for her right
now because she's not entering the relationship as a fully
mature, emotionally stable person

Caelin says: But that's just my take on it

Caelin says: Sorry, the more tired I get, the less tactful and delicate I
become

Armageddon shouts: Game reboot in 7 minutes 20 seconds .
You smile at Caelin.
