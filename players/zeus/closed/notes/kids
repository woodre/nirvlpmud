I never had any desire to raise kids until I met you.  If I am going to raise kids with you, I want to do it right.  We have plenty of time to talk about what 'right' is and what sacrifices we are willing to make.  For now though, I want you to want everything for our kids.  No sacrifices.  I want you to envision the ideal home for them.  I want us to try and make it perfect.  We can deal with reality as we go :)
