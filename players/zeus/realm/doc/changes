proposed changes:

wolf1     - ac 17, wc 36, heal 2,1, special 15/25
creature1 - wc 38, will add more specials (similar to other gurthers)
lion1     - ac 17, wc 35, heal 1,1
bear1     - wc 33, hp 575, special 15/60
troll1    - ac 17, hp 550, special 30/40
gorilla1  - hp 800, wc 30, heal 1,3
hunter1   - ac 16, special 40/20

reasoning:

my area is a high level area for obvious reasons.  my area used to feature
weaker level 20 monsters, which balanced out because of the difficulty of
the area.  now that "weaker level 20" doesn't mean anything, I wish to
make the monsters worth an amount that reflects the difficulty of the area.
