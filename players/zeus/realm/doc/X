Two of the NPCs in the /x rooms have 6000 coins each worth in treasure.
The two NPCs in question are headless.c and wraith.c.
I think 6k each is justified for 4 primary reasons.

  1) It's 6k in treasure, this case heals.  They can only be sold for
     about 2k.  A similar monster is Snow's caterpillar, which has
     10k - 30k worth in heals on it.

  2) The two NPCs each have a 1 in 10 chance of fleeing from the fight
     at any time.  If they flee, it causes the player to have to move
     around, making more NPCs, or take the chance that it will dest
     after it flees.

  3) These are not your average level 20 NPCs.  The wraith has a very
     potent special, doing 10 to 60 damage, and is invisible.  The
     headless apparition has a WC of 40 to 47, high above the standard
     WC for an NPC of this level.

  4) The environment which these NPCs are in is not your typical setting.
     If you don't know how it works, read the X_README file located in
     this directory.
