Taus is an expansion of the Fallen Lands.  road1.c connects w/ path21.c of
the city.

Features:
	blacksmith who can sharpen eq
	heals (limited -- and need to be looked at)
	npcs w/ good money, no eq, higher wc, lower ac
	all "cash" items need to be 'barter'ed or 'sold' to 2 dif npcs
	rooms still use fl_demon.h although I have a revamped version of it
	area is pk except for the grove

Notes:
*	fl_demon.h was changed so that if the player is above 95% health,
	there is -no- chance that a demon will come.
*	the OBJ's the npcs drop in /city will need to be changed, and a new
	version of Tyborlek will go in to take the gurther horns for coins.
	right now they are 'cash'ed.. just need to change desc and rm func.
	the old gurther will barter for the items in /city
*	the npc Auseth has a great wep (needs to be looked at [fine tuned])
	the npc Dolan has a great main body armor
*	the main NPC gurther.c has a special to call a guard into the room
	value of horns is set by the npc
	all occasions of gurther.c are random.  [look at the rooms]
*	there are some big demons in the cave w/ nice heals
*	if you kill enough demons you can get your title set by Tyborlek
*	cave7.c has a bunch of treasure in it.
*      SEE ~/realm/taus/MAP for a general layout of the area
