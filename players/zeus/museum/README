The Museum of Legendary Warriors

  The museum features 9 different monsters which players can fight.  There
are 1 of each that can be killed per reset.  They are all difficult npcs,
and have good items on them.
-NOTE: there are 5 chances to fight each npc, but they may only be killed once.
  The monsters are fought in a 9 room arena.  ~/arena/ it is pk and non
teleport, however players can exit at any time from any room.  Once there
are no players in it, the arena is cleaned of all items and NPCs left.  So
there is no way to leave, heal, and return to continue the fight.  Once
a person has entered the arena, nobody else may use it until they have left.
-NOTE:  the arena is PK for everyone, except polymorphs!
-NOTE:  all fights are player vs npc only, no team ups.
  The museum itself features holographic projections of the NPCs which just
makes it seem like an actual museum.   Just a futuristic one.
Added a heal dispenser in lounge.c, selling zp1, zp2, and zp3.c
