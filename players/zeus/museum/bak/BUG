->> ~*~Handy~*~: what is the deal with that?
Sundin tells you: It only happens to multi wielding people....it was an old
poly bug i told miz about many times...

~*~Handy~*~: not that I ever kill there but I really miss it :(
Sundin tells you: Dervs, poly and Dark Orders....are the only people it can
happen to really

Billy tells you: when you opening the museum back up?

tell sundin ah
Okay
->> Sundin tells you: and even with that....it's a slim chance

tell sundin you know more than i do :D

Sundin tells you: I have a char in almost every guild...and have not had it
happen in the museum yet...course i don't play many other
chars other than this one right now and my bcm a little. I
think the problem may lie in guild coding actually and not
the museum :o)

Sundin tells you: it seams when the secondary hit gets the kill..that's when
it 'can' respawn at 3/10
