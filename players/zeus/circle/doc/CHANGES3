/* beta changes */
- fixed STUPID ANNOYING problem in hb.h - 20% xp moved to guild upon joining.
- fixed call_out error in ghall.c - also involved the_save() and load_spells()
- removed login to dark rooms
- Added a 'beats' variable like Snow's dervish have.
- Added a bonus if random(ac) == 0 in wep hit, +1 sp  [if foc && pos end]
  Armor hampers them, so without armor they are more focused in combat.
- Made it so descend works vs players in pk areas.
  this is what i intended, just forgot i had a pl_k check
- Added bonus sp to wither.h  < 1mil = 4, < 2m = 3, < 4m = 2, <6m = 1, else 0.
  Did this to help them out [more] once they get 100k gxp.  + more msgs.
- Added a check for players in pk areas in who2_new.h
- Redid 'seek power' failure msgs to be more thematic.
- Removed hp cost when focus runs out if gxp < 1mil.
- Added small endurance bonus if low gxp on drain.h
- Meditate:  small hp heal based on duration, can last 1 sec longer.
  Might change this to be based on corpse level later on.
- focus.h, if gxp < 800k, wc = 3+r(7+r(6)) each hb,
  else wc = 3+r(8+(gxp/800k)) - also raised max possible
  wc in a hb from 3+r(16) to 4+r(18) [average of under 14]
  Based cost on gxp, now ranges from 14 to 15-29 [higher than original]
  also put in if already focused, 1:3 if gxp < 500k end +3 bonus
- added the vanish spell in at 3.6 mil gxp with NT and NM checks.
- Set minimum endurance to 25 [ravyn is far too low at 16]
- Added sps drain when in dark rooms [-1 per hb].
- Added a 'low endurance' msg when it goes negative.
- Added 2 new sets of message_hit msgs in weapon_hit if focused.
- Added a few more msgs to 'one' in wep_hit, lowered return by 2 [8 to 6] and
  made it more likely to happen [20% to 25%].
- Added safety checks to init.h
- Added a min value check [< 100 coins] in drain.h for safety
- Added a full sp/endurance heal if User drains a shadow wep [10k cost to make]
- Added a up to 4 command speedster, with checks for acceptable dirs.  Free
  ability, closest thing i can get to 'shadow movement' which is what a few
  players have suggested.  they get it at the beginning [ability not spell].
- Put in mud_spells2.h with mythos approval.
- Changed most spell costs [see spell_list], weave still top at 5mil.
- Added a "death check" in who2_new.h (shows name in HIW, queries real
  name rather than name so "some mist" doesn't show up)
- Added a energy_check death log, and changed trigger from < 15 sps, to
  < 15-random(16) [more likely msg will mean death.]
- Added more messages to mud_spells.h
- Modified the endurance formula.  it was lvl + ste + (gxp / 195k)
  now, if gxp < 1 mil, it's   10 + (lvl / 2) + ste + (gxp / 100k)
  else it's the same.  range of 25-38 initially, then 25-90.
- Added a log in g-old.c for buying components.
- Capped focus at 24 (18 inititally) and duration at 15 (prev 20).  Made it
  take longer to gain max possible duration.  Added 1:4 chance in mud_spells
  to gain 1,1 foc,dur.  Added 1:5 chance in shadowblast to gain
  r(3), r(2) foc,dur.  Obviously no bonus if not focused or neg endurance.
- Added fdraw emote in emotes.h
- Added slow hp regen for empower spell, raised comp cost 1000 coins
  because of added usefullness.  1000 to 2000
- Added extra_look()s to weaken.c and empower_spell.c
- Added "endurance monitor" in place of msg when endurance goes negative.
  Displays endurance as a bar "|||" showing percent.  10 bars == full.
- Added a variable so the endurance monitor can be toggled on or off.
- Moved hp cost of focus to spell casting from hb, and spread cost out.
- in end check, made it so not focused, less likely to drain endurance.
- made spell_failure work off of gxp rather than level 
  [goes away entirely at 8mil rather than 5mil now]
- changed how mana regen works, see file.
- upped base wc if focused from 4 to 7.
- added a new spell check to daemon.c - tells them a msg if they can learn.
- added scoff and wait emotes.
- added some msgs to empower_spell.c
- in spell_failure.h if attacker_ob->is_player(), no chance of spell failure.
- coded a monitor 'mon' that shows endurance in 10% chunks
- recoded mud invis to be thematic.  same cost, added spell failure.
- in focus, if gxp < 2mil and AO == User, wc += 4;
- lowered based foc wc from 7 to 4+random(2) because of above bonus.
- switched gxp costs of meditate and empower
- added NM checks for spells
- added a 7th symbol relating to casting.
- added spell failure to mud_spells.h + a few checks.
