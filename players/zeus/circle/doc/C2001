************************** Year 2001 *****************************************
1.02 - Modified drain again so if item cost is < 50+r(150) item dests.
1.06 - Added vigor to current spells at 6mil gxp, approved by Wocket.
     - Made it so weaken will end if target is below 10% health and 50 hp.
     - Increased sp requirement on dark_prayer from 40 to 45, making the
       spell slightly easier to cast.
     - Added two new variables to know, one which counts players in the
       target's room and one which counts living things.  No names or any
       other information is given.  Concept approved by Wocket.
     - Added code to chan_obj.c to make players not be a part of the channel
       until they actually accept.  Also added a channel history reset command
       to chan.h and recoded some of the bad stuff.  What was I thinking.
2.22 - Fixed 2 infinite money cheats relating to bartering components.
       Cobain discovered it over a month ago and did not report it, has
       exploited it a number of times since.  Added an exception for
       Cobain that will last 62 days; components cost him 3x as much.
3.06 - Changed the add_hit_point() in shadowblast's finisher to hit_player()
       and changed the value from sps * -1 to sps * 2.  This only applies
       to NPCs and compensates for AC.  This is what was originally intended.
4.11 - Verte updated my set_title.h code to conform to the new xlevels.  Not
       to mention that his code is simply way better than mine ever was.  woot!
4.23 - Added an optional level sort to the who command but didn't tell anyone.
4.29 - Added in beckon shadows spell at 50k gxp approved by Wocket
     - Added in shadowweave illusion approved by Wocket.  raised sps cost from
       50 to 1/2 max sps and limited to 1 weave per wep at Wocket's request.
5.13 - Increased sp drain when >= 2 fallen are together by 4 per person.
5.17 - Increased cost of bone powder component from 500 to 600 coins.
     - Added an endurance drain if >= 2 fallen are together, -# of fallen a hb.
     - Added an endurance bonus of 0-5 to drain.h based on value of item.
6.05 - Modified spacing in who2_new.h a little based on Worm's comments.
     - Made it so Fallen do more dmg and drain more endurance in PK vs each
       other.  Numbers are based on gxp so big guys don't crush little guys.
6.19 - Modified know.h at Mal's request so invis players of equal level 
       can't see each other's location.
     - Removed invis check in who2_new.h at Mal's request.
8.31 - Doubled end gain from draining items (based on value), now 0-10.
11.27 - Added "dscnd" as an alternative to "descend"
