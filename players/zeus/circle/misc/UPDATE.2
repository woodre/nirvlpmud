|                The combat monitor should work fully    |
|                 now.  To add endurance to the monitor, |
|                 just use #end# as you would #hps#      |
|                 and so forth in your customized        |
|                 combat monitor.  If you need help,     |
|                 contact Vertebraker or Zeus.           |
