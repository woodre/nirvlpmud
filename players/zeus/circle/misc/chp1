=Conquest----

  The Humans could never stop warring against each other..  The wars had
gone on for almost their entire history, they were a part of their culture.
Many warring groups formed together as they fought to dominate one another.
Beautiful planets were decimated as their fields of war.

  In the year of the elders, the Order of the Circle left the wars.  After
having won a major victory over the Mages of Darkon, with their newfound
knowledge they fled to a distant planet.  It is their best attempt at
securing their power and fortifying the position as one of the most powerful
groups of Humans in the galaxy.

  Upon their arrival at this beautiful planet, they quickly began to make
it their new home.  They built magnificent cities upon the land which were
monuments of their power.  The only thing which hindered their progress
were the Gurthers, the most intelligent natural inhabitants of the planet.
The humans killed them mercilessly, driving them to the farthest edges of
the planet.  As time passed, they gained control of the entire world.
