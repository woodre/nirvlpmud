              The fifth symbol -   Armor ----

  Armor is said to protect those who get hit.  We believe that it is
better to be faster than the enemy and not to be hit at all.  In order
to be quick with your powers and your wit, you can not wear armors
which would hamper your powers at too great a cost.  Nor can you wear
shields for they interfere with spell casting.  Only the lightest of
armors are acceptable to wear in combat as protection, and even then
they will hamper your abilities.
