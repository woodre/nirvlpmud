              The third symbol -   Endurance ----

  The powers we use are strong and demand much of our bodies.  When we
use them and engage in combat we slowly become weak and drained.  Only
a respite from combat, or perhaps meditation can restore lost vitality.
One who drives the body too hard will suffer greatly.  While power is
ultimate, we have yet to be detached from our need for strength.  Over
time one learns to extend endurance, but this takes time and focus.
