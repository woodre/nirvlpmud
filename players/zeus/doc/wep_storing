currently:  wc < 19 can store with restrictions on specials
            nothing else can store, w/ exception of elemental weapons

idea: all weps store, but great weps have a % chance when used to
      become unstorable.

Wep category
  basic    - avg wc < 20 
           - store outright
             found on any npc/store/etc
  powerful - avg wc < 27
           - moderate misc bonuses
           - store w/ 1:2500(+/-) to change to unstorable
             found on lvl 20+ npcs, quest rewards
  godly    - avg wc > 26 or excessive additional dmg done
           - very good or copious misc bonuses
           - store w/ 1:2000(+/-) to change to unstorable
             found on lvl 24+ npcs, quest rewards.  hardest to get

Factors on odds of changing: difficulty to obtain, built in drawbacks
Exceptions would have to be allowed to accomodate for the elemental weapons

Other ideas:
  mal's idea:  powerful weps take up more locker spaces than normal weps.
  feld's idea: have all eq autoload.
