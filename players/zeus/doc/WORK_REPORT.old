Tue May  4 14:50:52 1999 Problems with my code, Mythos fixed it.  oops
Tue May  4 14:51:33 1999  For some reason the hp weren't declared in /../zeus/realm/NPC/troll1.c so I put it in there, 400+random(150);
Tue May  4 14:52:11 1999 And also for some reason, an exit error I fixed a while ago I must've unfixed a while later.  path1.c6 leads south to path12.c instead of path13.c  fixed.

Wed May  5 21:51:58 1999 I updated /../zeus/realm/city/path1.c   path4.c  and  path6.c    Each room had an infinite money loop in it because a variable was being defined in init().   Also, the function sw_dir was being called twice in path1.c because I updated fl_demon.h earlier today.
Thu May  6 13:00:00 1999 /../zeus/realm/city/ent.c path4.c path7.c path9.c path13.c path14.c path17.c path22.c shrine.c   Fixed how npcs were cloned to room, so there won't be multiples after the room resets.

Mon May 10 16:58:29 1999 Fixed /../path14.c so you can 'drink' other things
Mon May 10 16:59:49 1999 Changed the set_short() on /../OBJ/lionman.c  so it isn't all capitals.

Fri Jun  4 17:52:33 1999 A couple weeks ago I raised the ac's on a couple npcs.. I now see there was no reason for doing that, becuase for players the demons are a pain.  the ac's are what Snow originally approved.   // hunter1:  lowered ac from 15 to 13, gave it random(1000) coins    // murdok:     lowered ac from 12+random(3) to 12   // troll1:     lowered ac from 17+random(3) to 14+random(3);
Fri Jun  4 17:56:12 1999 Oh I also removed the wield msg on the gdagger.c  Nobody will know it was ever there, because no player has ever gotten the weapon yet.  *smirk*
Fri Jun  4 18:12:19 1999 Fixed the death log on Murdok so it won't error if they player isn't wielding a weapon.
Sat Jun  5 22:35:28 1999 Changed path25.c so when the player moves east, instead of cloning 3 agro demons, it clones random(3);

Mon Jul 12 15:57:56 1999 Changed grove.c so the druid only loads once per reboot, and made it so all purchases go straight to him.  He has a death log on him, so if I find players killing him i'll make him harder.
