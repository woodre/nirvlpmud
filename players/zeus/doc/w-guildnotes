no offensive magic

the moves queue is a set of combat moves that the player executes, one
after the other while in combat.  all the player needs to do it execute
the pattern, and it will go until it runs out or fighting stops.  the
player can learn up to 3 patterns, based on glevel.

all do the same amount of damage, which is based upon level, glevel,
and maybe some attributes.  maybe you learn one for every glevel,
and you start out by learning 3, 2 O 1 D.  not sure.

moves queue:
  offensive:
   * slash
   * strike
   * cleave
   * stab
   * charge
   * hack

  defensive:     - ac val increases quality
   * block
   * spin
   * duck

defensive moves don't just increase ac temporarily, because that would
make them virtually worthless compared to offensive, so instead they
raise a temp ac val that stays high for a few rounds then goes back
down to the original ac.



defend <player> - would shadow target player, diverting X damage to player.
  this would prevent the player from using their own defensive
  or offensive moves.

protect <player> - if player gets attacked, you automatically take the lead.
  up to 4 players at a time

haste    - increased wc and ac       [limited time]
berzerk  - increased wc, negative ac [limited time]
flee     - retreat from combat
fatal    - basic finisher with weapon
examine  - stats on a monster, player, item
