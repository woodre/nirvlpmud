The boobs are done like this..
extra_look_two() {
return this_object()->query_adj()+" "+this_object()->query_bust()+" "+this_object()->query_cup()+" breasts";
}

Looks all confusing cos it's getting values from what the player sets their boobs to be
Basic seems to be like this..
extra_look_two() {
"blah"
}

The star has this..

extra_look()
{

/* verte fixed this to display "You have" etc. */
  if(environment() == this_player())
    write("You have a small " + YELLOW + "gold star" + END + " tattoo on " +
      "your inside right ankle.\n");
  else write(environment()->query_name() + " has a small " +
      YELLOW + "gold star" + END + " tattoo on " +
      possessive(environment()) + " inside right ankle.\n");
}

I dunno the difference between the extra_look and the extra_look_two..  shrug
