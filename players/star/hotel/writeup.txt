----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are no heals in the area.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The only items are on the living mobs downstairs, which are already in
game and approved.  The upstairs ghosts have no gear, since ghosts
don't generally wear clothes.

Other info about the area

In up_hall1.c the player must kill both mobs in order to be able to
get into 207.c.  As mentioned above, in 217_bath.c a player must pull
the curtain back to clone the corpse of the lady.  This resets with
each room reset.
