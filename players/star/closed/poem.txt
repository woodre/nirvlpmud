The note is titled 'Poem FAQ(Raphael, Sep 12)':

Webster's dictionary defines a poem as, "A verbal composition designed to convey experiences, ideas, or emotions in a vivid and imaginative way, characterized by the use of language chosen for its sound and suggestive power and by the use of literary techniques such as meter, metaphor, and rhyme."  I think I can safely say all Bard GCs want you to write the very best, most evocative poem you possibly can.  You can always ask specific questions, of course, but here are some common ones I've encountered. 


Does a poem have to ryme?
No, e. e. cummings made a career out of writing free-formed poems.  Note that his use of free form text added to the process of reading as opposed to making things confusing.  I don't expect the next e.e. cummings to be in this guild (but it would be grand if he was), but I also don't want too see those poems from the high school literary magazine with mindless line-breaks in an effort to be "deep."

Do I have to follow a format (haiku, limerick, sonnet, etc.)?
Again, no.  I used a Shakespearean sonnet for my poem because it made the writing process easier, it might be worth a try, but you don't have to do it.  Certain forms carry certain expectations, so be aware (although, as always with language, there are exceptions).  Limericks are generally ironic or funny and haikus remain one of the most difficult forms of verse.  Pick it if you want a challenge, not if you want to write the fewest number of words.

What should I write my poem about?
Something Bardic, which has a broad range of definitions.  Bards deal with music and language, so pretty much any emotion is fair game.  A poem about going to the store isn't too exciting, try to find something to fit the fantasy theme of Ryllian if you can.  Think big!  Think epic!  People still read Homer today because he wrote on a grand scale.

Why did you spell rhyme "ryme" earlier?

To see if you were paying attention.   :)
