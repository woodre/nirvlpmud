Hercules tells you: tell pavlik if he wants players to b nice to his 
beta's he better tell them not to gain entire guild as enemies
You tell Hercules, "he been messin with the rangers?"
Hercules tells you: not him,one of his mages
You tell Hercules, "No..  I meant has Crip been?  Since it was him you 
were askin about before..  I figured Pav wasn't"
Hercules nods solemnly at you from afar.
Hercules tells you: he lured a low lvl ranger in party and murdered 
him... not brightest idea
You tell Hercules, "he what?  Did he actually kill him, or get him 
killed by leaving him someplace?"
Hercules tells you: murder... in person...
You tell Hercules, "who?"
Hercules tells you: crip
You tell Hercules, "laff..  which ranger silly?  *8)"
Hercules tells you: eh :) psi or psyco... just a sec
Hercules tells you: psyco
You tell Hercules, "heh...  I have a mage char..  that's a huge no-no 
while in beta..  I'll let Pavlik know"
Hercules tells you: i dont know if he did it while mage or before he
joined,thats why i asked u how he got in there...
Hercules tells you: if he was there from start,then it happened as 
mage
You tell Hercules, "Ya know how long ago he did it?"
Hercules tells you: isnt there obit log somewhere ?
You tell Hercules, "laff..  likely..  but I dunno where..  *8)  I'm 
sure someone who does can check it"
You tell Hercules, "I found it..  I'll let Pav or someone know and 
they can check it against when he joined"
Hercules tells you: can u mail me with how it ened ?
You tell Hercules, "if I'm allowed..  I don't see an issue with it, 
but bein fairly new I'm not sure"


NOTE: This is what I found in /logs/DEATHS.old
Tue Feb  7 14:48:19 2006 psyco 41809 exp 2948 gold killed by crip.
So this ought to be checked against when he joined mages.
