You tell Worm: right..  and if you had the tunnel the dragon would still be there..  cos he follows you dead..  I grasp it..  I'm just wonderin if it's something someone would say you need to deal with cos of the limitations of your guild..  heh
->> Worm tells you: this guild has no wiz and has plenty of issues that needs
fixing.. but noone cares to take up vertes slack

Worm shrugs at you from afar.
->> Worm tells you: i'm sure some douchebag wizards would be like 'screw
shardaks' just because i kill ppl.. but that doesnt make it
fair.

You tell Worm: Hey..  I already have one to watch over.. *8)  And I need help with it if something goes wrong cos guild code isn't my thing.. laff
->> Gargoyle ( player 19+5 ) has left the game.
Worm tells you: well, i'm irritated over the whole idea.. not the death..
just the BS of losing all my shit.. so i'm going afk to
smoke. if ya can, my 24 spheres lost would be fine

You tell Worm: nod..  and I agree with you..  I already intend to ask Fred about getting you guys a tunnel to Shardak or someplace

Fred wizs: nothing in the mob or room code that would stop leaving.
(Invis) Shinshi wizs: I mean he does have a point but he doesn't
Star wizs: that's odd Fred..
You tell Worm: let me know when you're back
Fred wizs: if the mob is there, there's like a 33% chance you'll slip while
leaving but that just means you need 3 tries to get there.
Star wizs: rofl..  wonder if he tried, couldn't leave, and didn't try
again..
Fred wizs: that's up to you I guess, if you want to reward him for being
too lazy to try try again well......... :)
Star wizs: when he comes back I'm gonna ask him why he couldn't leave and
go from there

You return from being afk.
