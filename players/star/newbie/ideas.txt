Newbie portal with lots of areas linked..  ask around for favorite stomping
grounds..  check sub dirs of /players for dirs named "newbie"

re-send "recall" command to the portal

Update newbie book..  likely in Softly's dir..  make it more obvious that
it's available..  maybe look into auto-loading it onto all newbs

Newbies should start in the newbie hall

Char customization should be done before login, then they login at 
newbie hall..  not the lazy way as is currently the case..

Map of the newbie hall??  If there's not one, put a dispenser there, or 
maybe put a map in the book

Death cost way less for newbs, and save their corpse and auto resurrect

Newbie book file /players/softly/nhall/obj/nbook.c
     Add guilds to the list
     Add no pk to the bard listing
     Make the book more easily found and well-known
     Add unlisted areas going into the portal, to the list in the book
     Add info about the portal, recall, and return portals to the book
     ***  Check book for more possible needed changes  ***

Maybe a shop in the newbie hall??  If so, maybe a sign saying that
     adventurers who have done well financially and wish to look for
     good gear should check the main shop for things others have sold.

See if newbie book has information on the wimpy and consider commands

In the newbie hall, room n4, the library, states that the portal chamber
     is to the east.  The room to the east is actually the lockers.
     Fix, of course, but also maybe a good room to put the portal
     chamber off of.  Or possibly a 'portal' exit from main hall

Check that newbie areas let in levels 6 and 7, not just up to 5
