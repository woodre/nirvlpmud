whispering woods is 5e, 5n, touch wheel, touch woods

Saber's Dreams can be accessed from the hut or from the tower, but
     there is no way to get from there back to the hut.  Waking brings
     the player to the tower.  Maybe either make waking take players back
     to the hut.  Or maybe remove the dreams from the hut, and have them only
     accessible from the tower, then add those directions to the newbie book
     and that entrance to the portal
