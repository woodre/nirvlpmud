All of your items have one problem in them, and I'd be shocked if any of
them actually load..  laff.  The lines at the beginning say reset(agr) and
if(agr) instead of arg.

One more thing about the items is what they're worth.  If by some chance a
monster popped with the maximum of seven french fries, and the fries sold
for the maximum amount of cash, the monster would end up yielding the player
over 10k in coins.  Monsters of level 18 are supposed to have around 3500
coins according to /doc/build/monster/monster.guide.

Now on to the item specific corrections.
In cheeseburger.c, "disgusting-looking"..  hyphenated word.
In crackpipe.c, I've never heard anyone say "once-was"..  maybe it's a regional
     thing.  Grammatically it ought to be "This once clear glass tube"
     Also, "yellowish-white"..  hypen again
frenchfries.c in the long desc..  put a comma after the word old
furclumps.c ought to have "caked" in the long desc, not "cake"

For the mobs, check over the file I mentioned above.  If they popped with the
max on those random stats they'd have too high of a wc, ac, and hps..  wouldn't
hurt to lower the random just a little I think.
