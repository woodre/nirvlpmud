Here is a brief description of my quest.  The theme behind my area is
the hunt.  Following that theme, My quest requires the players to get a job 
with the caretakers of my realm and figure out who has been messing up the hunt.
Heres the rooms/parts/pieces:
start in main room and ask angst about the quest.
he will take the player to the start of the quest.
From there the palyer must ask for a job, this gets him a badge.
he must ask where to go, this will tell him about the portal.
type portal, kill all the soldiers,s, kill driver, w(e) kill guard, kill hitler
get tounge from corpse, go back to cia headquarters, w (lab), search, read, analyze tounge, this hints for them to go find gengis khan, back to main room (angst), d, war, there are three secret paths, the barkeep will also give hints about
the three khans, (khan1-> /players/heroin/hunting_grounds/preds/hg10 kahn2->hg5,khan3->hg2) kill all three khans, get all three pieces of paper, return to angst, he'll take them back to director, ask director, he'll tell them to glue the pieces, glue pieces, complete letter, ask director, hints to go to angst, show angst letter, he'll take them to hell, enter, read letter, sets quest_name to

Change:  Khan2 is now in /players/heroin/hunting_grounds/jokes.c
This was just to spread it out a bit, and force players to explore 
more of my realm.
