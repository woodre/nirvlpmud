June 10 1995
Changes to Predator realm include:
I fixed that stupid heartbeat prob. (fear us newbie coders w/out guidance)
Also: a whole realm of monsters at level 20 is silly so I lowered
the Predator w/blades to 18..wc is 2-3 below chart but
hp set at random extra 100 + random 120.  Rules say this is ok.
Also this pred only carries 500(+500rand) coins instead of 1000.
Preds no longer chase..however ya will need the predstone to leave,
this means players will have to actually kill the main pred, or one
other pred that i have hidden in the realm.
Other predators will be lowered to level 13.
All predators match guidlines except: only have 300 (+random 400) coins
instead of standard 700.
**** Every thing should be up to snuff****
