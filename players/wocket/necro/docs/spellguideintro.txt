    [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]
     
     
     As Sagan traversed between this realm and the next, many powers
     and spells were discovered by him, far eclipsing what could 
     possiblely be written down.  However, many attempts have been 
     made to do just that.  Unfortunately they have also tended to be
     grossly incomplete and blatenly misinformative.  This book
     tries to be the most complete and current list of spells that
     have since been discovered.
     
     This is version 2 of The Complete Guide to Spells and I am 
     sure this one shall be appended to and rewritten many times 
     over as new skills are rediscovered and passed on.
     While this is not a "complete" list, as it shall never be, I
     would like to hope that it is, none the less, the most informative
     book to help you on your quest to greatness.
