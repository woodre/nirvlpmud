    [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]
         
     Many years later, Sagan stumbled upon a developing city 
     named Qual'tor. Qual'tor was run by a council of elected
     officials that oversaw the placement and construction of every
     thing with the city itself. Sagan approached the city as a
     wandering healer, offering his services to anyone who needed
     them. Qual'tor's officials were pleased with Sagan for doing
     so, and offered him a permanent home within the city itself.
     Sagan agreed, but only if he was able to build his own hall
     of healing, which quickly became the city's first hospital.

     Sagan built an underground stronghold for his necromantic
     traits, even taking in a couple of acolytes and instructing
     them in the dark arts. This went on for many years, completly
     unknown to the council. Sagan was eventually appointed as
     council elder, and took over the governing duties of the entire
     city of Qual'tor. This allowed him to control the city's small
     garrison of men-at-arms. They rooted out anyone who suspected
     that Sagan was practicing anything but healing in his hall
     and many, many people were put to death under treason.
