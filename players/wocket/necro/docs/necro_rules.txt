    [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]

         The Rules of the Necromancer Guild

     1- A necromancer is allowed to kill other necromancers though
        it is highly frowned upon.

     2- A necromancer will not steal a corpse from another 
        necromancer.  A corpse is the source of the guild's power, 
        and is the most precious thing to the guild. 
     
     3- If a bug within the guild is discovered, I will reward any
        necromancer that reports it.  This goes to typos, spells or
        anything else that I might have missed or overlooked.
        NOT REPORTING A BUG IS A VIOLATION OF GUILD RULES

     A player will be warned once, then thrown from the guild. If
     you cannot live by these simple rules, you should not be here.
