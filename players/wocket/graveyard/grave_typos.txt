Okay, these are the typos I got just after a casual walkthrough of your area.
I might've missed a few of the alternate monster descriptions, but I've
gotten two pages of notes, so I figure that'd be enough. :)

Yours truly,
Feldegast


gr1.c - petrude -> protrude
gr2.c - remove 'in' and 'the' from the 1st sentence
gr3.c - petrude -> protrude
stone dryant - he/it need to decide gender in desc.
gr4.c - 2nd sentence comma necessary?
      - 3rd line liter -> litter
gr6.c - a fire -> afire
ghost - flows through what?
air zombie - predeter -> predator
           - your -> you're
gr5.c - down-pour -> downpour
ghost - seen -> see
      - mearly -> merely
gr7.c - "grave stricken" ?
      - lead->leads
      - remove "in" and "the" 2nd line
      - 3rd sentence sounds weird
gr8.c - "appears to be closed in..."
      - "It seems like it's"
gr9.c - comsumes -> consumes
ghost - just redo all of these descriptions
stone zombie -> "as he wanders"
gr11.c - swears -> swerves?
gr13.c - taht -> in that
      - fainly -> faintly
      - "for a long time."
gr14.c - rethink line 1
       - threatons -> threatens
       - existance -> existence
       - upon, -> upon it
       - sence -> sense
gr15.c - untill -> until
       - sparer -> sparser
gr16.c - "south it leads"
       - "east it leads"
       - "from being disturbed."
gr17.c - along side -> alongside
       - walk way -> walkway
       - continuing -> continues
       - step -> steps
temple.c - enought -> enough
         - Ther -> There
         - hand -> hang (tapestry descrip)
         - brutle -> brutal (same)
marthi - advisary -> adversary (attack emote)
       - "huge rings are on her hands"
       - shouldn't she have a 'mummy' id?
crypt1.c - everwhere -> everywhere
         - mearly -> merely
crypt1b, 2, 2b, etc.        "
        - I recommend making all of these duplicate rooms inherit crypt1.c and just change the exits.
ruby.c - is -> it
