Based on that and my ownideas, I have started putting together a draft proposal.I hope to have this first cut done today or tomorrow and thenI will post it on a website for review and comments.Illarion and Scathe - If you have any initial thoughts thatyou'd like to see included, please send them to me or postthem here asap.-- Cosmo**[1;36mRoom Ideas                               [2;37;0m ( Illarion ):**Okay, I've done a bit with rooms so far, so here's a list of the thingsI've either done, or thought would be a good idea.multiple ids for items without having to duplicate the descrip each timeobjects: non-takable items that appear after the exits (basically items         that have a short description as well as an id and a longroom-type flags: indoor, outdoor, ground, midair, underwater, forest,                 city, field, outer space, hot, cold, wet, dry, etc    (multiple flags per room)tracking code: when something passes through the room, a record is kept               of which direction it left indynamic descriptions: descriptions that change depending on the conditions                      of the room, without the need to manually redefine                      the items array.  One way to implement this is to                      have long() look for string patterns in the long_desc                      and items, and replace those patters with the return                      of a functiondoors and locks: pretty self-explanatory, we don't have enough of these,                 and more would make guilds that aren't totally combat-                 oriented more useful.That should about cover it for now.  I'm sure more things will come up.**[1;36mDraft Proposal                           [2;37;0m ( Cosmo ):**First of all, my apologies for not being around the past coupleof weeks. I had a personal emergency that kept me offline.As for our environment proposal, I have put together a firstdraft and posted it at:     http://www.angelfire.com/mb/third/environment.htmNote that this does not include any of Illarion's commentssince I just read them for the first time. If anyone hasadditional comments, please post them here and I'llincorporate them in a revised draft.I haven't heard anything from Mythos, but I assume he wantssomething fairly soon.**[1;36mRE: Draft Proposal (12/21/99)            [2;37;0m ( Cosmo ):**I have updated the proposal, and also posted it in:   /open/cosmo/environment.txtFeel free to add your comments to this file as necessary.**"
