/* Quest notes for the Euka Forest */

1] Hint:  Listen to the gossip in turtleville.  News travels fast.
2] cmd 'listen' in ~/turtleville/pub.c:
   Man says: there is something strange happening.
   Woman says:  I heard there is some wizards sacrificing euka.
3] cmd 'ask bartender':
   Bartender says: Ya, So I hear something strange is happening over
     in the euka forest.  They dont speak english over there but I
     heard Yelster is living out there.  You might want to hunt him
     down.
3] find Yelster/ 'ask Yelster':
   Yelster gives translation book to adventureer.  speak is now translated
   for player.
4] Find elder 'ask elder':
   Elder says:  There are 3 protection rocks that when set in their
     corners bring protection to the forest.  An evil wizard has scatter
     them across nirvana. please help find them and destroy the wizard.
   Elder says:  Here, take this.  This devining rod will help you search
     for the stones.
5] Elder gives rod to player:  rod will notify player when they are close
   to a stone.  there is a time limit on the rod before it breaks.
6] player searches out stones. (there are 8 random locations for stones)
7] players need to find switches to raise up stone holders (may have them
   talk to elder again. or someone else.
8] player places rocks.. (will at one point run into the wizard and must
   kill him) perhaps prior to placing rocks
9] euka gather around him.. elder gives quest points and prise of some sort.
   perhaps something he treasuers but is utterly pointless to the player.
