They speak in an interesting sentence structure.
They first state what kind of sentence it is going to be
wheter question, statement, explination, etc.
then is followed by the subject then verb then any direct object.
example:
  <question> <where> <is> <food>
They have little or no punctuation besides this order structure
making it simple and rudementary.
