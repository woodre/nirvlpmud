I drew a little drawing of how the tower looks, and where some of the
things are placed...I would like to sketch in some more rooms, but this
is how it looks now...

Oh, the sketch has a staircase running through the core of the tower,
and there're rooms on either side of the core in a staggered fashion.
        Observation deck
                                       Horn(summoning)
        Archsorcerer's suite
                                        Private studies(players)
        Mirror(to Calthia)
                                        Lyceum/Library(w/office & archives)
        Hidden entrance to Necro Crypt
                                        Teleport Annex
        ???
                                        Shop


I need to think up a few misc areas that may or may not have a use other than for
rp, also some inventive/interesting for other sorcerers to hang around.
I imagine there being many sorcerers of greater or lesser ability hanging around
the tower, and if you're nice to them they might teach you a spell or two. *shrug*
