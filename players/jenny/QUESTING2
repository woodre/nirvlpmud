                         [help questing]
-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------  

At some point, a player may wish to attempt solving quests, which
are tasks a player must complete given a vague set of clues.
Quests exist to mentally and physically challenge the player.
The point of solving them is to be considered for wizardhood, or
simply for fun.  When a player solves a quest, he or she is given
a certain number of quest points, which depends on the difficulty
level of the quest.  Currently, players need 284 quest points, in
addition to having attained level 19+16, to be considered for
wizardhood.  Strong fighting and exploration skills are the keys
to successful questing.  Go to the advance guild
(s,3e,s from the church) and type list to see the number of
unsolved quests you have.  To get clues for each quest, type
list 1, list 2, list 3, etc.

You may receive help from other players while questing, both
physical help fighting monsters, and help from other players with
clues.  Players cannot expect help from wizards in solving a quest.
A wizard's player character is allowed to provide you with physical
help during questing, but cannot assist you in any way with solving
the clues.  The rules outlined in "help multiple" also apply.  This
forbids a player from doing things like killing off quest monsters
with one character, then logging on another character to finish the
quest.  Violations of these rules will result in appropriate
punishment to everyone involved.
