This is a memorial to Dreamspeakr, who was a wizard here, and passed away.
mural.c is basicly an invisible bulliten board, it's set up in the room monument.c
From the players perspective, it should look like the mural on the wall.  I have set it
up so that wizards level 40 and up can remove innappropiate contributions.
