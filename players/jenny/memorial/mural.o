Who will be there to pickup my corpse when I fuck up? Who will wiggle the bottomwhen I'm feeling down? ...A few have tried, but it's justnot the same...The game just isn't fun without you...**far away(francesco):**Six thousand miles are nothing when true friendship arises.**My respects.(symbio):**I am here to pay my respects.  Dream, I knew you a little bit, we had a few conversations but we never were really friends.  What I did know about you was that you were very kind, and very considerate.  Those are two qualities that some of us lack, including me.  I'm going to miss you Dream, there's always going to be a place in my heart for you and I mean that...  I lend a touching hand to Languilen for I know that you two were relatively close...Love,	Phil KenroyPS- Life works in fucked up ways.  Ways that I don't understand the meaning to.  But I hope Dreamspeakr is happy, whereever she may be.**So long my dear friend.(mortarion):**What can I say?  I do remember dreamspeakr as Nemesis, and Ladydiamond.I remember her as a bright spot when 'Diamond first arrived back in the daysthat she was a vampire and Khrell was one as well.  I remember her being 'evil'in the shardak guild.  Althought she tried she never could be as cruel as I actedshe was a counterweight to my role-playing style.  She kept me on track and would not hesitate to smack me about if I was being stupid.  We spoke a few times on the phone.  Thought now years have passed since we last spoke I stilldid wonder about her.  Sadly today I learned she woudl no longer be able tospeak to me, or slap me around like in the old days.  Dream, I am sorry I wasnot there to say a goodbye.  Rest In Peace my good old dear friend.  I will keep you alive in my heart always.  Some day I promise to visit your grave and give you the flowers I had promised to send you, my friend.  Goodbye.-John   (aka  Mortarion and Khrell)**My Mother(sweetmisery):**My Mother was Dreamspeakr, Nemesis and a few other names...She made my life a beautiful thing to experience. I am going to write a full detailed description of what happened on the bulliten board and let everyone know how she died and thank them for thier contributions to this mural. I cried when I read it. Whoever took the time to create this...thank you...its beautiful..Im sure I will contribute more and I hope that this memorial stays a permanent part of Nirvana. Im sure I will visit it often. It was very hard for me to come here but it is something I needed to do. I loved my mother very much and I feel empty without her in my life.Thank you for remembering her and keeping her memory alive. I miss her as do you all.Kristina VreelandForever Dreaming of Dreamspeakr**This Time(vital):**With heards assunder, suffering the weightof matchless grace unfettered, we assembleto pay tribute to the fallen. We sound ourmight war cries, our primal yalps, and thesilent cumulative whispers of our helplessfears for the fallen friends who have goneon before us. I see before me the greatestline of those who have traveled beyond themortal coil to touch the heavens without afear or doubt. Dreamspeakr we honour here.Vital**Years Later(sweetmisery):**I often come here to this spot in the world of Nirvana just to think about mom. When I come here I get to see a part of her mind that only the people that were a part of this world saw. My mom live on here and everytime i come to this mural i cry. I miss her so much. She has two grand children now , my daughter Krystyn Nicole Diamond and my son Tyler Brandon Hunter. My daughter has her smile and her additude and every time she looks at me I see my mother in her eyes. Mom died of diverticulitis for those of you who wonder. It is a disease of the intestines and I have the same problem. Although I doubt mine will ever get as serious as hers,it is still scary. I found out a year after she died. Thanks everyone for remembering her.I love you momma and I miss you so bad.Kris**Tears....Sorrow....Loss(swampturd):**Dream...What more can i say than that u were one of the first to ever party with me herei see you are gone but definately not forgotton i cry as i write these words ofremembrance to our honor. You characters were mean and somtimes spitefulbut a few of us got to see the tender and soft side of youfor those memorys i thank you.Formerly Howdy the ShadowSwampTurd the newbie lost in a word of chaos without you in itwe all love you**"
