Each player who was a member of the 1997 or 1998 championship teams has a
chance of having a /items/1997ring.c or 1998ring.c cloned to them.  These
are storeable armor - ac 1 and do damage.  They also have a chance of
breaking and becomming non-storable.  If a player gets both the 1997
and 1998 rings, and figures out to find a jeweler, he can combine them
into 1 piece of armor, and ac 2 ring that does damage, and stores, it 
also has a chance of breaking though.  below are the chances that each
player will clone a ring.  because of how rare it is that they clone,
these will be very rare, especially the combined ring.  The chances are
based on a combination of how tough the monster is, and how important
I think they were to the team.
