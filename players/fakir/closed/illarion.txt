~*~Mantis~*~: If you talk to Mode today, you must know garble. Its a lot like jive...hahaha.
->> chuckle
You chuckle politely.

~*~Illarion~*~: Whereas to talk to you we just need to know stupid?

~*~Mantis~*~: Shut up Illarion. Idiot wizards like you should be neither seen nor heard.

~*~Illarion~*~: Thought so.

~*~Illarion~*~: And you talk big, but next time you think you have a bug, you won't be able to wait to talk to me or any other wiz you can find

~*~Illarion~*~: COurse, it'll probably turn out to be soemthing you did to yourself anyway

~*~Mantis~*~: You start insults...you can also take em. Otherwise....butt out unless your a player. Wizards should not insult players. THATS my point.
->> Feyth arrives.
Night nods solemnly at you from afar.

~*~Illarion~*~: Why not?  I can tell you're acting like a tard without logging in a player.
 
~*~Illarion~*~: If you can't defend yourself on a purely verbal level, then you need to keep your stinky trap shut.

~*~Mantis~*~: Lets just do a history of star....Hrmm...Wizard butts his idiot ass into players business. Thats expressly against the rules of wizard-dom....interesting. Now shut the fuck up.

~*~Mantis~*~: Wizards like you give all the rest a bad name.

~*~Illarion~*~: Ah, so it's not okay for me to make a comment (and a true one I might add) about you acting like you have the brains of a Stegosaurus, but it's okay for you to interpret rules that don't apply to you in the first place?
~*~Mantis~*~: And while your at it...do something constructive around here.

~*~Mantis~*~: Someone needs to interpret them...obviously...you cant.
->> ~*~Illarion~*~: You know Mantis, I envy you.  It'd be nice to live in a world where I was always right, no matter how stupid and wrong-headed I was.

~*~Mantis~*~: I'd say your about half a breath from a demotion if there was a wizard here higher than you that knew the wiz rules and enforced em.

~*~Illarion~*~: You want to pk, fine, then pk.  I'll stay out of that.  You want to make idiotic comments on channels, be prepared to take the consequences
*~-*-~*~ Illarion laughs.

~*~Illarion~*~: Why?  I haven't used my wiz powers or my wiz knowledge in the slightest.

~*~Illarion~*~: If you're going to make threats, make sure you make ones for yourself, not for someone else, and especially make sure there's some force behind them.

~*~Mantis~*~: Thats exactly what reflex did when he got demoted. He laughed. Then he got demoted. And you are almost being as stupid as he was...and is. (wizards are NOT to mix in player's business. period. read your wiz rules.)

~*~Mantis~*~: Of course...you know so little about being a wizard...I am not surprised you dont know the rules.
->> ~*~Illarion~*~: Mantis, do you have a wizard character here?
 
~*~Mantis~*~: What do you care?

~*~Mantis~*~: You REALLY want to see if I do?

~*~Mantis~*~: Cuz if so...would your being demoted to level 21 prove it?
->> ~*~Illarion~*~: Sure, go ahead and commit the wrongs that I'm not, but that you're accusing me of anyway.
~*~Illarion~*~: or you could stop acting like a dumbshit because I took a potshot at you, like I've been doing for years, in front of every senior+ imaginable.


***The following was said on wiz:

Illarion wizs: I dunno how idiots running around waving their dicks about
without getting called for it is going to help build, exactly
Illarion wizs: But fine.
wiz What precisely do you define as 'waving thier dick around'?
(Invis) fakir wizs: What precisely do you define as 'waving thier dick
around'?
->> wiz And what business is it of yours, as a wizard...if they do? Its players stuff. Not wizard stuff. Log in a player and play...or keep the hell out of it.
(Invis) fakir wizs: And what business is it of yours, as a wizard...if they
do? Its players stuff. Not wizard stuff. Log in a player and play...or keep
the hell out of it.
->> Illarion wizs: Okay, so if I'd made the exact same comments as a player who
has no intention of every setting pk or going into a pk area, it'd be okay?
I don't think so.
Illarion wizs: either it's allowed or it's not.  I didn't use anything that
being a wizard gives me, so it should make no difference wether I said it
as a wizard or not
wiz Well, I don't really care WHAT you do as a player. Neither does anyone else. What we are talking about here is what you do as a wiz.
(Invis) fakir wizs: Well, I don't really care WHAT you do as a player.
Neither does anyone else. What we are talking about here is what you do as
a wiz.

(Invis) eurale wizs: being a wizard carries certain behaviors
wiz As a wizard here, you have a slightly elevated position here....over players.
(Invis) fakir wizs: As a wizard here, you have a slightly elevated position
here....over players.
->> (wiz) Illarion smirks.

Illarion wizs: First I've heard of it.

(Invis) eurale wizs: then you've not paid attention, methinks... :)
Illarion wizs: Again, if I log on a player that everyone is going to know
is me anyway, how is that different?
wiz Then...when a player calls you an idiot...he basically has the opportunity to call ALL wizards an idiot....and he is right...if wizards do idiotic things...like butt into players affairs.
(Invis) fakir wizs: Then...when a player calls you an idiot...he basically
has the opportunity to call ALL wizards an idiot....and he is right...if
wizards do idiotic things...like butt into players affairs.
->> (Invis) eurale wizs: wizards are NOT to get involved in player issues
Illarion wizs: who's involved?  I just made a comment
wiz A comment you should not have made. Your a wizard.
(Invis) fakir wizs: A comment you should not have made. Your a wizard.
->> (Invis) eurale wizs: insulting players as a wiz, no matter who they are is
not acceptable and never has been
wiz Log in a player and make comments like that. Thats all I am saying.
(Invis) fakir wizs: Log in a player and make comments like that. Thats all
I am saying.
->> (Invis) eurale wizs: log on your player char and do it
wiz nod.
(Invis) fakir wizs: nod.
->> Illarion wizs: I'm still waiting for someone to explain how making them as
a player everyone will know is me already or within a week is different

wiz 'YOU' are not important. Being a wiz char is. It has nothing to do with you...it has to do with the position.
(Invis) fakir wizs: 'YOU' are not important. Being a wiz char is. It has
nothing to do with you...it has to do with the position.
->> wiz If you don't understand that...perhaps you should not be a wiz.
(Invis) fakir wizs: If you don't understand that...perhaps you should not
be a wiz.
->> Illarion wizs: I'll think about getting a flagpole inserted into my ass,
then, so I can be like the two of you.  Sorry to stir you out of whatever
you were doing.


(Invis) fakir wizs: Well ask B his opinion on the matter. And I am not
talking about the past. I am talking about what would be good for the mud.
->> Illarion wizs: What, you think wizards being a quiet, seperate group is
going to 'turn things around'?
wiz Its been too long sence you were a player. You forget how they feel.
(Invis) fakir wizs: Its been too long sence you were a player. You forget
how they feel.
->> wiz I'm saying those same wizards...chatting as players rather than wizards...would be better for the mud.
(Invis) fakir wizs: I'm saying those same wizards...chatting as players
rather than wizards...would be better for the mud.
->> wiz Again...I know you cant see the difference..but there is one.
(Invis) fakir wizs: Again...I know you cant see the difference..but there
is one.
->> wiz And B has expressly said wizards can now log in a player char at the same time as thier wiz char....that was not the case some time ago. Why do you suppose he did that?
(Invis) fakir wizs: And B has expressly said wizards can now log in a
player char at the same time as thier wiz char....that was not the case
some time ago. Why do you suppose he did that?

->> Illarion wizs: Because he was tired of saying no when asked about it.

(Invis) fakir wizs: No. Not hardly. Just think about it Illarion. I am
going idle agian.
->> (wiz) Illarion chuckles.


***This was said to fakir after he went idle:

Illarion tells you: Dude, I remind you, I've been at this longer than you. 
What Boltar does these days always results in him being left alone as much as
possible.

Illarion tells you: I'm sure this will lower the number of complaints he has
to field for a while, and I'm pretty sure that's the main reason he did it.
Illarion tells you: Making the players and wizards into more distinct groups
is only going to make us less acessible, which will probably result in Nirvana
being less popular still

Illarion tells you: but whatever...  since I intentionally stay out of that
kind of thing, I suppose I can't talk

***Then illarion told Mantis:

->> Illarion tells you: Oh, btw...  don't you think it's a tad hypocritical not
calling me on this until it was your intelligence I insulted?  Why don't you
"just think about" that for a bit.

Invis) fakir wizs: Illarion..I am tired of this. Here is the deal. You
have been warned by TWO seniors as to behavior. Now do as the rules
state...and just shut up about it....or I will demote you right now. Is
that simple enough for you?
