Ok, this is an explanatory file about how to use color.h

Basically, you must include color.h in the file you want to
put colors into. To do this, type:
#include "/players/fakir/color.h"
- at the top of the file.

Then, when you want to put color in, just type the color
name wherever you want the color to start, and type OFF or END
wherever you want it to end. For example, if you wanted an ogre
to be a red ogre, in reset you might have the line:
set_short(RED+"Ogre"+OFF);
Or, if you want to add the color in the middle of a line:
set_short("A Ferocious "+RED+"Ogre"+OFF);

Another example could be in a message to the player or to
the room in a function:
write(BOLD+"You fall down a hole!\n"+OFF);
or
say("A "+YELLOW+"Banana"+OFF+" falls to the ground.\n");

It's pretty simple. You just have to remember to include
the file and treat each of the colors as a text string,
which means adding the "" and the ++ around the color.
I will make a sample file below:

inherit "/obj/monster.c";
#include "/players/fakir/color.h"

reset() {
  set_name("bob");
  set_short("A "+YELLOW+"Biliously"+OFF+" ugly man named "+BOLD+"Bob"+OFF);
  set_etc etc
}

If you have any more questions, let me know. -Snow
