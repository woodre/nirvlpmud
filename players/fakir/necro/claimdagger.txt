     Necromancers are artists in the area of corpse dismemberment.
     To accomplish this delicate type of surgery, an extreemly
     sharp instrument is necessary.  The realm of darkness can 
     supply just such a tool when called upon.  Eventually, a
     skilled and learned necromancer can develope harvesting
     abilities with other sharp instruments.
