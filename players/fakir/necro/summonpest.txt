           Summon Pestilence (offensive)

     The realm of death bestowes great power to its followers at
     times, but in turn, requires great sacrifice.  This spell
     will accomplish one of two things. Certain death of either
     the one who casts it, or the one it is cast upon.  The realm
     of death makes the choice, depending on which soul they
     desire at the given time.
