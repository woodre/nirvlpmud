 [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]
         
           Wither (offensive)

     Once a necromancer has mastered all aspects in dealing with
     with the realm of death, and communed with the spirits on a
     regular basis, he gains the special knowlege and ability to 
     utilize the power of a captured soul from a former adversary.  
                    
     A soul is the very essence of life itself, the culmination
     of all one becomes or ever will be.  To use such a component
     in the casting of a spell is a powerful and potent endeavour.
 
     The result of such a spell is something to behold.  Those 
     who recieve the soul of another cannot bare the holding of
     it, and wither as they stand.
