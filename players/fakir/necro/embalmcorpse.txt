 [------------------------NECROMANCERS-------------------------]
         
         Embalm corpse (miscellaneous)

     A fresh corpse is always the preferred material for spell 
     and component usage, but a wise necromancer will always 
     have a few spare corpse's in his bag. To keep the corpse
     in good condition, it is necessary to prepare it properly.
     Embalming will ensure that it does not rot or decay, and
     also allows one to lift and store the corpse without excess
     difficulty.  A corpse may be harvested before embalming.
