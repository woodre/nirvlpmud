messages "kids(Darknesss, Oct 22):**I think it would be a good idea to be able to resurect kids for a price depending on the lvl of the child until it gets to a certain age. I have had my kids die for something that shouldnt happen, a pet it supposed to take side damage when it is second to hit, yet somehow the kill still kills them. Just an idea that would be nice.Darknesss**update traveller(Danilo, Mar  8):**Maybe someone could update the traveler to include info on all the current mud guildsincluding the ones that have been reopened**A great idea(Vertebraker, Aug 11):**A great idea would be for wizards to code and players to mindtheir behavior and just play the game with REAL, THOUGHTFULfeedback.A boy can dream :)**Idea(Santa, Dec 25):**Here's an idea..How about to have the option to have our pets autoload? Make them outrageously expensive, and maybe just vanity pets. They don't have to attack anything or carry anything, just something to follow us around?MERRY CHRISTMAS!**"
