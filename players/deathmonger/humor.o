Nott was shot andShott was not. In this case it is better to be Shott than Nott. Some saidthat Nott was not shot. But Shott says that he shot Nott. It may be that theshot Shott shot, shot Nott, or it may be possible that the shot Shott shot,shot Shott himself. We think, however, that the shot Shott shot, shot notShott, but Nott. Anyway it is hard to tell which was shot and which was not.**Seals(Sid, Jan 22):**A baby seal walks into a club...naked**bars(Les, Feb 22):**  Skeleton walks into a bar,          orders a beer, and a mop.   *-Les-***Once upon a time(Kasia, Apr  6):**Once upon a time there lived a kingThe king had a beautiful daughter, the princess.But there was a problem.Everything the princess touched would melt.No matter what; metal, wood, plastic... anything she touched would melt.Because of this, men were afraid of her.Nobody would dare warry her.(marry)The king despaired.

The frog jumps forward 2 feet. He then decides to see what happens if he cuts off the legs of the frog, one at a time. So he cuts off the first leg, and says, "Jump frog jump." This time the frog only jumps 1 foot. So he continues with the experiment, cutting off one more leg and commanding, "Jump frog jump." This time the frog jumps only 6 inches. With each leg removal, the frog jumps a shorter distance. When he finally cuts off the last leg and says, "Jump frog Jump," The frog just sits there. Once again the researcher commands, "I said, Jump, frog!" The frog still sits there. The scientist quickly wrote up a paper about the abilities of frogs.

This should be on the board downstairs. So sue me (Don't get any ideasSado ;)You people who bitch at me because 'this thing ate me without warning', and'this Borg cube thing suddenly appeared in my castle, analyzed me, and zapped me and i lost all my stuff can you give it back plus the 100K experience for my mudkids?' better STOP.Yes, my jello tub castle has a lot of good stuff to help players, and themonsters are always at their recommended legal limits for reward-carrying,but all that stuff comes at a price, namely life-threatening hazards.There are monsters that will eat you and steal your stuff, and theoccasional tornado will suck you up, and the Borg cube likes to zap people,but HEY, life isnt always nice and peachy. I could be a real prick but NONEof my hazards affect new players (level 5 and under) and you have tophysically type 'kill tiamat' in order to experience the abject pleasure ofdying repeatedly. I mean, get a CLUE, the monster has 9 heads and carriesno less than 30000 gold coins and weighs about 100000 kilograms so go figure,it's gonna be a BITCH to kill... *fbog***a joke(Lucius, Jan 30):** It's hard to find a joke without a dirty word or two in it.

A smalltree begins to grow between them, and the beech says to the birch, "Is that a son of a beech or a son of a birch?"The birch says he cannot tell.Just then a woodpecker lands on the sapling. The birch says, Woodpecker you are a tree expert. Can you tell if that is a son of a beech or a son of a birch?"The woodpecker takes a taste of the small tree. He replies, "It isneither a son of a beech nor a son of a birch. It is, however, the best piece of ash I have ever put my pecker in."**funny ads(Lucius, Jan 30):** Actual classified adsFREE YORKSHIRE TERRIER. 8 years old. Hateful little dog.

Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. Ifit's up, put it down. You can handle it. We need it up, you need it down.You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.2. Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon. Let it be.3. Crying is blackmail.4. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one. Subtle hints do notwork! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!5. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.6. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's whatwe do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.7. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.8. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact,all comments become null and void after 7 days.9. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us toact like soap opera guys.10. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.11. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the waysmakes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.12. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done.Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.13. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say duringcommercials.14. Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we.15. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, forexample, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no ideawhat mauve is.16. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.17. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act likenothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth thehassle.18. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer youdon't want to hear.19. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared toscuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.20. You have enough clothes.21. You have too many shoes.22. I am in shape. ROUND is a shape.23. Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couchtonight, but did you know men really don't mind that, it's like camping.**The Biggest Laf(Vertebraker, Aug 11):**elysium.edenproject.org**This is for all the Domo-Kun Lovers(Fleshhunter, Oct  1):**http://www.worth1000.com/entries/104500/104796NsUR_w.jpg**HO HO HO(Santa, Dec 25):**Why is Santa always so jolly?Because he knows where all the naughty girls are.HO HO HO!**"
