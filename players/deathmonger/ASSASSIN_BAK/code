NO ASSASSIN SHALL:

1.  Cheat on a contract.  Remember at all times that you represent the Guild
    at all times, and we can't have our reputation tarnished.  The penalty
    is banishment and addition to the hitlist.
2.  Kill a player not on the hitlist, unless in self-defense.  The mud
    will not tolerate roaming bands of assassins killing everyone in sight,
    so this rule will be strictly enforced.
    For this reason, the penalty is death for infraction of this law.
4.  Fail to worship Deathmonger.  The penalty is utter humiliation.
