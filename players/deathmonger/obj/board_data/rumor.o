There has been more change since 2002 than in the previous 1,000 years. Change is accelerating. Invention, connection, adumbration of ideas, mathematical algorithms, connectivity of people's social systems, this is all accelerating furiously. And under the control of no one. Not the Catholic Church, the Communist Party, the IMF. No one, is in charge of this process. This is what makes history so interesting, it's a runaway freight train on a dark and stormy night.**Posh(Jeanyus, Dec 16):**Oakland City representer address me as your majestyYeah you can kiss the ring but you can never touch the crownI smoke a million swisher blunts and I ain't never comin' downBitch you ain't no barbie, I see you work at Arby's#2, supersize, hurry up I'm starvinGnarly, radical, on the block I'm magicalSee me at your college campus, baggie full of aderralsCall me if you need a fix, call me if you need a boostSee them other chickenheads? They don't ever leave the coopI'm in the coup cruisin, I got them stolen plates,Servin all the fiends over there by the golden gate bridgeI'm colder than the fridge and freezerI'm snatchin all your bitches at my leisureYou can't find that? I think you need a google mapMy pearl handled kitty-cat will even push your noodle backNow google that, groupies fall me like twitterI'm rolling up my catnip and shittin in your litterWhile you looking bitter, I be looking betterThe type of bitch that make you wish that you ain't never met her,The editor, director plus I'm my own bossSo posh, nails, pierced with the gold flossWhich means nobody gettin over meI got the swag and it's pumpin out my ovaries**"
