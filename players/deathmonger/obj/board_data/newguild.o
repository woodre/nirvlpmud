messages "Ideas for Guild(sandman):**I want to make this guild a true fighters guild. Similar to the traditionalAD&D paladin player class. Here are some ideas I had for the guild.1. Weapon Proficencies/Specializations - This will be vital to the guilder.   It is his weapon in place of spells. Training with a certain "type" of    weapon would yield the player additional damage against a foe. Rob has   made a good start on this, I'll be looking at what he's done, and so    should Steve and then we can talk about if it will work or if we want    something different.2. Another power the paladin has is a limited heal spell. In the AD&D game,   the paladin could heal 2pts/level once per day. I think we can keep the   2pts/level, but maybe make it once per real hour. This might not be alot   of times, however I do not plan on making it cost anything. It is an inate   ability of the paladin.3. Detect Evil - Another ability of the paladin is to detect evil in a person                 or monster.4. Alignment Restrictions - The paladin loses all paladin powers when he turns                            neutral and evil alignments. I was thinking we                             could have a quest where if you turn evil, you can                            find this potion or something to turn you good.5. Levels - The paladins would have their own guild hall, where they would have            to raise their real levels. (there is code for this in the adv_guil            d). The price for raising real levs would be higher than the normal            player. This eliminates the need for guild levels. Also there             would be quests to do at lv 5,10 and 15.6. WarHorse - A paladin can call a War Horse at lv 4 in AD&D; however we could              make it higher, then give them a nice little war horse pet.7. Increased STR & STA - since they raise at our own guild, we can make it so                         they can raise str and sta to like 25, while mag and                         int is only a max of like 15. Also they do not get                         to use missle, shock, fireball.Anyhow this is a start, kinda an outline I toyed with in my head, let me knowwhat you think and add any ideas.-Rich**NEWER - weapon_proficiency(molasar):**I ran the changes listed in guild/proficiency file on my MS-DOS mud andit worked to perfection.So..take a look at the formula...and decide what types you wanna useBTW..the formula is new, so the maxes have changedweapon proficiency is the same from 1 to 20hit_mod is now between 6 and 12**My four cents(deathmonger):**Random thoughts to follow.We should have a guild kernel that takes care of basic maintenance sothat new guilds can be created easily.  For example, I'd port the assassinsright away.Perhaps we should have an anti-Paladin, (Dark Knight?) that has spellsvis-a-vis the paladin, except opposite (ie, the paladin heal would bethe anti-paladin's harm).Paladins frequently have intelligent weapons.  Perhaps weapons can bemoody.Steve.**"
