messages "party object(Sleepwalker, Feb 10):**If you create a party object and go kill a monsterthe experience gained by the party will be reported. Then the experience gained by you, the only memberof the party will be reported. However, the experiencegiven to the player will always be 1 less than thatgiven to the party. At least one wizard thinks theobject loses track of the exp or simply mis-reports it. Thanks,Sleepwalker**warhorse(Sleepwalker, Feb 12):**There is a guild which has a warhorse which a playercan then ride around on (I surmise). However, when the warhorse is in a room, other players cannotinteract with it at all. You can't look at 'horse','warhorse', or even the warhorses name. If the intentis to make it so that players can't kill the warhorsethen so be it, but there are more interesting waysto do this which still allow for lush interaction byother players in the room.other players in the room.Thanks,Sleepwalker**party object(Someone, Feb 16):**The mud lib cannot handle but integers numbers.It therefore rounds to the lower integer whenreal numbers are used.This is what happens when using party objectswhich always indicate one exp less than whatis actually gained.But I guess it is not a big deal  :)**bloodscar asci problem(Sleepwalker, Apr 21):**If you have the Blood Scar of Mortal Kombat it gives youa nice ability, which is to get a list of the current pkers orpeople in pk areas. This is the 'ppl' ability. I am noticing that it has problems with certain ASCII titles.These cause the ppl list to truncate or have bad wrapping asif line feeds or returns are being eaten. The expected behavior would be that anyone with any type oftitle (or room name ASCII style) would display as normalin the ppl list. Thanks, Sleepwalker**old bloodscar sucks some ass(Vertebraker, May 11):**Old bloodscar sucks some ass.You should upgrade and do the "NEW" Mk, since the old isn't supported anymore.**Old bloodscar owns you(Stone, May 24):**Much better to get old-school points than pk stats.
