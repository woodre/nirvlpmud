	Each race is different in its form, habbits, mentality 
and abilities. With that in mind here is a list of races
with its expected stats, advatages and disadvatages:

	 	 1- Human
	Humans are the standard race. They have niether any 
disadvantages nor any advatages. This makes them suitable 
for most guilds especially if it's expected to explore 
different guild.

		  2- Elf
	Elves are taller and thiner than humen. Despite their
weak bodies, they are suitable for most guilds because
their minds allow them to be capable mages and their 
high dexterity give them the quickness needed to offwield
a second weapon effectively.

		   3- Half-orc
	This stocky, powerful race is a crossbreed of the
orcish and human races. They are exceptionally brutal,
violent, sneaky beings and thus make excellent assassins.

intellectual. They are powerful warriors and fear the
psionic spells. Half-orces can see in the dark with
thier infravision.

tall. With such a body comes the low stealth and 
dexterity. Draconians, however, have the strength to be 
great fighters and the mentality to be excellent mages. It
may take a few attempts from a draconian to enter/exit
a room through its door.

They lack the intellegence needed for mages, the dexterity
and stealth needed for assassins, but instead they are 
blessed with the great stamina and strength required to be 
a strong knight or a brutal warrior. Despite their low 
intellegence, Dwarves are very wise and capable of 
learning fighting skills faster than others.

light. Thus liches prefer fighting in the dark and use
