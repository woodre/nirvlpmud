Quick guide to commands:

ls  -  see what is in your current directory.(LS)
cd  -  no argument and it tells what directory you are currently
       in.  Examples of arguments:
       cd /players/dusan
       if your current directory is /players/dusan, then to get
       to examples directory, cd examples   (no / to go up one)
cd ..  - takes you back one directory.
more - look at a file: more armor.c
tail - look at the last 30 or so lines of a file. tail armor.c
cat  - look at the first 30 or so lines of a file. cat armor.c
ed   - enter into edit. (this sucks, i suggest wordpad until
       you can get ahold of arachnophilia as a text editor.)
cp   - copy a file.  cp workroom.c /players/dusan/examples/workroom.c
       or you can do full paths: 
       cp /open/maledicta/test.c /players/dusan/examples/test.c
load - load a file. load workroom.c
update - update a file. You NEED to do this if you make a change.
       Otherwise, you will keep the old copy in memory and it 
       won't change it right away. Good process: load <file>,
       update <file>, load <file>
log - shows errors you might have in your files.
rlog - removes your error log. Do this often so you don't clutter
       everything.
rmdir - remove a directory. rmdir examples
mkdir - make a directory. mkdir examples
clone - clone an object. clone /open/maledicta/dusan/vaxe


/****************OTHER**************************/
goto - you can use a filename, or a player name. 
       goto /players/dusan/workroom
       goto maledicta

home - return home to your workroom.

localcmd - tells all of your commands currently available. (Big list)

wizlist - that thing that ppl look at to brag about. (pointless)

p - ppl command for wizards. Shows ip, etc etc.

dest - dest an object.  dest ring, dest quicktyper ... etc.

stat - gives info on a player or mob.  
statall - gives info on all players.


There are other commands, but for now, this should do.
