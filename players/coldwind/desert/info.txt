Intro: 
       The area is about an enchantress that promises some winged apes a better
	   home and uses her magic to make some giants follow her orders.
	   With this army she takes over an Arabian village. Fares, an Arabian knight
	   that servived the attack on the village is trying to sneak into a cave where 
	   he is expecting the enchantress is staying at. He is not sure if he would be 
	   to kill the enchantress, so he is offering his sword to anyone that is
	   willing to take risk of killing Ashgan, the enchantress and the evil that 
	   started roaming in the village.
