Druids[c] Vertebraker 2001

Druids are a spellcasting, magelike guild developed on the fundamentals of
preserving and manipulating Nature. They command the elements and they
strive for internal and external balance in the world around. They are
an elitist, tightly-knit group, and do not afford Alliances with other
guilds. Their powers are based around and are given strength by the
"Tree of Life", which resides in the Great Forest.

DRAWBACKS
 i.   Druids may not be members of a mini-guild, or any alliance,
      such as Rangers, Knights Templar, or Shardak, because their devotion
      is always to Nature first and only.
      *Good one....they should be relying on each other
      
ii.   Spell energies inconsistent with those surrounding Nature will
      always be of a higher cost.
      *Could you explain this one a little more?  Like what you mean by spell energies that are not consistent with nature?
      
iii.  For each life taken with the Great Forest, the overall power of
      each Druid will be reduced.
      *Do you mean that every npc killed inside the forest decreases the power of the druids logged in?  Maybe make it so that the higher the importance of that npc to the druids, the more power they lose...for instance, like you said, the tree would cause great power loss and lesser npcs, less power loss
      
iv.   Druids are unable to kill other players, unless they are attacked
      first or are within the Great Forest.
      *Do you mean unable to set pk?  So that they can be attacked in pk areas and in the great forest?  Hmm...that would mean that little druids could become targets if in the forest healing
      
v.    Druids are severely punished for breaking The Laws of Nature.
      *Agreed...very good
      
vi.   Druids may not wield weapons while casting most spells.
      *Good
      
vii.  The powers of a druid may not be used against any creatures
      residing within the Great Forest.
      *Agree
      
viii. A druid's innate magical ability is only released through
      release of physical strength and health; thus magic
      may achieve a "25" attribute, but strength and stamina
      will never exceed 15.
      *Good too
      
ix.   A druid's ability is limited or hampered by the carrying of
      of extremely heavy items.
      *Do you mean that if they get encumbered, their powers are affected?
      
x.    Some spells require intense meditation beforehand.
      *What about meditating as something they always have to do?  Sort of communing with nature
      
xi.   Some spells may not be cast within a certain amount of time.

MISC:
 i.  The powers of a druid are enhanced within the Great Forest. *Enhanced how?
 
ii.  Before or inside the Great Tree, the druid will regenerate
     spell points faster. *I think inside...What about a spell to protect the tree that sacrifices a druid?  or two?
     
iii. Intruders into the Great Forest are announced over the
     guild channel.

ATTRIBUTES:
 Devotion:       Devotion to Nature, and the natural Balance of things.
                 Miscellaneous attribute.
 Spellcasting:   Influences how well a druid can cast spells.
 Power:          Helps determine the "power" of casted spells.
 Wisdom:         The druid's adaptibility to new knowledge and rituals,
                 helps with meditation and learning new spells.
*Are these extra stats each one will be able to advance?

HIERARCHY:
 There is no real hierarchy, but five Arch Druids are appointed
 by the guild wizard[s] to serve as the Tribunal [see LAWMAKING].

LAWMAKING:
 There isn't one person in charge of the Druid guild. There is a
 Tribunal, a united group of 5 Arch Druids in charge of passing Druid
 law and so forth. Decisions must be carried by a 3-2 majority,
 or not passed at all. These decisions, when reached, must have the
 "okay" of the 3 members, and then are placed into Law by the
 guild wizard[s], if necessary.
 *Good...but what happens if those 5 dont log in?
