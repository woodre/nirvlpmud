Hello There!
This area is one part of a much bigger area that will eventually all be part of the island of Balamb.  Like my first area, this is also based on the game, Final Fantasy 8.  There will be several small areas inside balamb as well as some larger ones.  The beach is only the beginning.

The beach consists of 12 rooms.  It will exit onto a plains area that will lead to other parts of the island.  It is a simple little area, but there are plans for this, as well as the rest of the island.  At the moment, I do not wish to formalize them because I haven't worked out all of the kinks.  Briefly though, the area will contain a guild based on the SeeD's of FF8.

There are two types of monsters on the beach.  The smaller is fastiticalon-f and at the moment, he is a level 14 npc.  That won't change, but in the future, players who are members of the SeeD guild will be able to draw spells from this npc.  The second npc is the fastiticalon.  It is a larger npc and is level 18.

Both of these npcs carry items on them when they die.  The fastiticalon-f has fish fins and the fastiticalon has water crystals.  At the moment all these do is provide cash when sold, but they too will eventually become spell components.

Each of the room descriptions are different.  Take a look and let me know what you think!
