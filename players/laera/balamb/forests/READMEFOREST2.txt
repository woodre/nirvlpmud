This forest is exactly the same as the first forest, except that it is smaller.  It includes 8 bite bugs, grouped in pairs, 4 funguars, 4 caterchipillars, 4 blue dragons and 1 T-Rexaur.

These forests are just a small part of a bigger island that will eventually include a town, a training facility, mountains, and plains.  When that is finished, it will then be based around a guild of mercenary's named Seeds, as taken from FF8.
