NPCs

	OVERALL
         Heh, well.. you have basically no treasure value
        for the T-rex which is what kinda concerns me..
        at an average level of 26, a player should expect
        to pull in around 14000 coins.  You are giving them
        1500 coins. *shrug*  But whatever.. it's your stuff :)
	 You're forgetting set_gender("creature");
	 for creatures :)  will give proper possessives, etc.
       The other creats look good, just in t-rex is
       where you got a little funky.

	* t-rex.c:
        A. heart_beat() coded spells:
         1. Room Attack:
            a. You do the hit_player() [deals dmg] before
               they see the msg.  These should probably be
               flipped, so they see they get hit, then they take
               damage..
            b. You currently call tell_room() when it has
               found a target.  Perhaps you should leave a tell_room()
               in that the target was hit and a tell_object() so they
               specifically are notified when they are hit, and move
               the tell_room() have now, before it found a target.
               
               tell_room(environment(), 
                 inv[x]->query_name() + " is hit by the tail!\n", ({ inv[x] }));
               tell_object(inv[x],
                 "You are hit by the tail!\n");

            c. After it has acquired a target and delivered the dmg once,
               you have it returning 1 .. which means the tail will
               not hit everyone, it only hits one person.  I think you
               should rethink this strategy, or just change the msg
               so it is only hitting one person, not "the whole area".
          2. Switch atk/extra dmg
            a. Here you do the same thing as you did in the room
               atk, you are dealing the dmg prior to the enemy
               getting the msg that they have been hit.
            b. The tell_room() here would tell everyone in the room,
               including inv[target] that inv[target]->query_name()
               has been hit.  Maybe you should expand the messages...
               Currently it would look like this to you, and the room:

    "T-Rexaur picks up Laera and shakes hard trying to rip off her head."

               If you added a 3rd argument to tell_room, ({ inv[target] }),
               and wrote a tell_object() to inv[target], it would
               look better like this:
    ROOM:
    "T-Rexaur picks up Laera and shakes hard trying to rip off her head."
    YOU:
    "T-Rexaur picks you up and shakes hard trying to rip off your head."

               *shrug* only style.. but.. :)

        B. Stats:
         Monster stats are FAR too low for the level, which
         averages out to level 26.
        -Your avg stats:
          HP 567  AC 17  WC 32
        -Req's per mguide:
          HP 1200 AC 24  WC 46

        C. Bonuses:
         You should add xp bonuses for the special
         spells you have added to this creature.  For
         more information, consult /open/NEWEXPGUIDE.
         In the meantime, here is what you should
         set the wc bonus to:
         set_wc_bonus(21);
         This is based on the formula:
       [Roomspellbonus is double for being a room spell that
        hits more than one person]

        roomspellbonus  = ((80 avg dmg * (1 / 10 chance)) * 2)
        otherspellbonus = (45 avg dmg * (1 / 10 chance))

         wc_bonus = (roomspellbonus + otherspellbonus)
         wc_bonus = 21

              
coding notes
--------------------------------------------------------------
- environment() is the same as environment(this_object())

- instead of declaring your local variables like this:
       int time; int blah; int do;
  you can just do:
       int time, blah, do;

- tell_room(ob, msg) has a 3rd argument of an array of objects
  in the environment 'ob' that will not receive the msg.
