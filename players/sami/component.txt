ok so, since Necro components are so hard to get as it is, it is hard to
accuraly asess exactly what it is that i think would be 'worth' it as far
as components go. as i am sure we all know, components from necro's is Very
tedious. as it is now, i do believe is still the way it should be. This meaning
that i think Corpses should still go off of Level of the corpse, and not a 
EXP value of said mob. however it would be cool to mayby use this exp value for
a chance of increasing what components it is that you could get from the mob, 
mayby like a 'break limit meter' of sorts.  basicaly my idea is like this


For every 5k EXP=chance for more blood
for every 7k EXP=chance for more skin
for every 10kEXP=chance for more eyes
for every 20kEXP=chance for more spines
for every 40kEXP=chance for more heart
fir every 80kEXP=chance for more souls

This could give you say for a Gordie Howe kill, a chance to get mayby 6-7 souls, mayby 10 heart...so on so forth
