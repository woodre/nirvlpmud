The elemental test is a Brutal test, and can be rewarding beyond measure with poerfull armors/weapons
and or experience and coins if one choses, however i fear there is no real reward for guilds that must
Wield a Guild weapon, and can wear no armors, Therefore, i request that we create a new 'attachment'
that will autoload with the mark, that if present, would allow that players Guild weapon also inherit
elemental bonus's such as the elemental weapons provide.
