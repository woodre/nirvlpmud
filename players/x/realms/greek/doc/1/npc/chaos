The original meaning of ???? /'xaos/ or /'?aos/ was "Space, the great outer void".

Ovid, in his Metamorphoses, described Chaos as "rather a crude and indigested mass, a lifeless lump, unfashioned and unframed, of jarring seeds and justly Chaos named". From that, its meaning evolved into the modern familiar "complete disorder", and the word "Chaos" is used by astronomers in Mars placenames to mean "area of disorderly faulted terrain".

Chaos features three main characteristics:

    * it is a bottomless gulf where anything falls endlessly. This radically contrasts with the Earth that emerges from it to offer a stable ground.
    * it is a place without any possible orientation, where anything falls in every direction;
    * it is a space that separates, that divides: after the Earth and the Sky parted, Chaos remains between both of them.
