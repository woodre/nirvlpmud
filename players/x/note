->> Earwax tells you: gear changes:  i'd like to at least set guidelines up for 
that shit, hopefully ones similar to what i've brought up already,   and i think
 all the guidelines we have should be looked at and updated
Earwax tells you: ie, heal costs, etc should be consolidated and refined a bit
Earwax tells you: mob cash, mob exp, etc.....
Earwax tells you: fakir brought this up (and i have in past) but mobs with top-e
nd gear or great coins should have less exp than those that don't
Earwax tells you: so there should be a dual guideline on things.....standard exp
-to-coin/gear guidelines, and then high-end gear/coin to exp mobs
Earwax tells you: ie, coin mobs shouldn't be at their max exp for their coinage,
 but rather a little lower
Earwax tells you: so say, a 8k mob can have 5k coinage or whatever, that mob sho
uld be 5-7k instead, i haven't put enough thought in it yet, which is why i brin
g it up, it's a raw idea right now
Earwax tells you: in short tho, those docs need to be revisited and rewritten fo
r clarity and so that there's no mistakes whatsoever
Earwax tells you: we could have the exp change added easily enough, just a flag 
for gear_mob() or coin_mob()
Earwax tells you: and the exp calc could do reduction
Earwax tells you: also:  i think there should be a posting - doesn't matter what
 your level you shouldn't modify your own stuff that's in the game, or add stuff
 to the game in your area without approval by another wiz
Earwax tells you: been more of an issue in past than now, but still
Earwax tells you: sorry, just a buncho thoughts running out heh
