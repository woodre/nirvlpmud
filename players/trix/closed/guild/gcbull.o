Well it will be   used when im here..  Expect notes!  *hahaha*  I have some thoughts   that I think can get this guild more ideas.  But then who knows   what is going on inside my head!  *grin*  Maybe the gods won't like   most of them but then who the hell cares!  *grin*  this is our game  and ours only. ;0  so lets get angry, and stand up for our rights.   (or is that left??)  anyway, lets get some work done.*blah*-Dev.**Tue Oct 25 02:08:03 1994 | [Nikki]: Sorry guys...:**        Well guys I've tried, I've put a lot ofwork into what I gave you guys. And it wasn't approved.I don't know what to do now. Greg the wiz used to beUnDeader is willing to help with the coding of newspells and ideas seeing as how Trixie doesn't havethe time. I think it is a good idea to acquire hishelp. That is my opinion.        As for the spells and the gstat idea andall that. I can't say what to do anymore. My ideawas shot to hell. And I guess I really didn't helpout as much as I thought I was going to. I'm sorry.        I think that Devin and Chalupa and Jaraxlehave come up with some really neat spells. If Trixis diplomatic enough and calms himself when he isaround Boltar I think they will be approved.        I'd like there to be an UnDead guild whenI get back. So try to work things out while I'mgone ok? *hugs you tightly* I'll talk to you allreally soon.                Ever Your Faithful Servant,                        N.**Tue Nov 29 09:05:17 1994 | [Devin]: (_)$ #%_)@#+%:**Use this fucking board now!!!-Dev.**Tue Jan 31 12:53:38 1995 | [Chalupa]: ok devin:**i used the board :)ok the first thing i want to talk about is undead aprenticeshipsim not saying do away with them, i am merely suggesting that youshorten the time it takes to lose ones aura, for the following reasonLag, there is a plentiful lag resource here and it make time move ohso slow.

First of all, Thanks Nikki for you support, it means a lot to Michelle and I.I'm sure we'll be very happy together.  Second, I was just trying to suggest that if we had a meeting like Nikki suggested in her note downstairs, we probablyshould have it on the weekends.

Trix and I figured it out and itworks perfectly. What Trix never got around to doing(because of lack of time in rl) was the apprentices should or will have the ability to talk on the guild channel,follow guild members and some of the lesspowerfull spells. That is what an apprenticeshipis. That way they get a feel of the guild, it's member's andthe basic structure.	Be patient and all this will be implemented. *smile*		Ever and Always,			N.**Wed Feb  8 13:15:09 1995 | [Chalupa]: apathy:**ok here it is, ive been extremely patient, and have enjoyed the guild immenslywell that is to say until the last month or twoWhat im about to say is not going to please any of you....The severe apathy in this guild is striking it into the mirenothing ever happens, and when anybody whines they are told to be patient	WE are a tolerant guild, but we can tolerate only so much.I've been here 6 months now and i know many of the member's perrsonalitiesmany of the newer pc's are alive and full of energythey want to have fun and escape from rl for a couple hours a daybut what they are recieveing here in return is, stagnation...That is unacceptable.Now to many of you older (2years or more) pc's you seem to have a lack respect to anybodys thoughts or ideas, not all of you mind you, and i wont bring in  names.Very recently the guild was on the brink of disaster, so one pc decided to do somethinghe did not wait to get approval, mostly because there is never anybodylogged in to give approval, and if he did wait, nothing would have happendAPATHY, or perhaps this guild and the whole mud for that reason is boggeddown in red tape and beuracracy.I know i have not earned the respect of many of you....but by the same token you have not earned mine, so dont expect itBe a productive member of this guild .....Or move overAnd if this is not accpetable to you then disband this guild!!im tired of the self righteous holyier than thou attitude that abounds herewell anyways, that is my 50 cents worthChalupa the Undeadps. my views are widely accpeted through the guild, many people who feel the way i do have left, id rather get booted than quit and nottry**Fri Feb 10 12:11:23 1995 | [Mizan]: ok... levelling...:**i didnt read the notes posted above yet- i dont have the time-but i captured them and i will peruse them in depth later. Ok. I shouleer should level with you guys...I've been working 70 hour weeks, taking minimal classes, but there isntmuch room for much else. Any bored wizzes out there look in /open/mizanand you will find two files, mob.c and gob.cThose are the guild files. Study and learn them... the spell engine israther simple, and hopefully you can make improvements and finish wherei left off. This is off topic, but i cant even maintain my own castle, nevermindrealistically finishing my guild. This is even more off toppic, butmy firm is expanding like a @#$@$#%!@$& (this is a family channel)and I am constantly on the look for people who want to earn some extra $$$.With 6-10 hours of work a week you can realistically make a good amountof cash (spending this time making $$$ instead of watching tv, or mudding even)If you want more info, mail me on the mud, or at moo@kyoko.mit.eduNo, i am not ashamed for getting a plug on my company out on this board.If you were making $3500 a month, with an average growth of 15% a month...would you? You dont have to be in the NYC or boston area to be involved.moo**Wed Feb 22 10:19:08 1995 | [Dent]: moniter:**Just reporting a bug...the guild moniter no longer seems to work...Lata...**Sun Feb 26 04:33:19 1995 | [Beren]: Hey.:**Attention to all GCs.As you know we are in trouble...

Now, we could take this in 2 ways...1) Panick and try to find another guild, or 2) Go out and recruit our asses off till we are too large to bedisbanded...Now, I have opted for number 2..I don't know if all of you will, but I have..Anyone esle who is with me, I urge you to mail Sandman concerning this and tell him that you want the guild to stay..Beren is gonna try to plead our case also... In the meantime, I am recruiting my butt off, I was brought here by Beren and I don't intend to let this guild go down 3 weeks after I join...I am averaging 2 new members a night and that should improve soon...I think the other GC's should give up on working on levels, wizzship, or anything else personal..we exist as GC's because we are devoted to the guild more than ourselves...people like Jaraxle, Devin, and Chalupa obviously didn't think so, but I think those of us remaining do...Now, my goal is todouble the size oof this guild ever week by having every member try to recruit one new person a week..Scratch is a big help, but he is on vacation for a week, so its up to us to get the newbies...Whoever is with me can say so now by staying, otherwise hunt yourselves a new guild and forget the Undeads..I am here to the bitter end...	Anyways, I am sorry to be so depressing, but I hope things look up soon....						Forever Undead,							Reflex/David**Sat Mar  4 08:20:35 1995 | [Reflex]: Adepts list...bugged.:**Beren or any other guild wiz,	I was attempting to count current members in the guild..but when the adepts list gets to 251 it cuts off with a sensitive mind message..if I am to recruit, it would be nice to know what I am shooting for...*grin*Thanks for your time!					-Reflex**Mon Mar  6 01:30:47 1995 | [Beren]: Aura.:**Ok, guys, about the apprenticeship.If you meet a guy who is currenly apprentice and reach level 5 (so he can join),ask him to 'abandon' first, then turn him undead. So there will be no bug :)This problem will be no actual in some days, cause there will be no apprentices (I think we don't have many and in some days all of them will be turned Undead)			Yours, Beren the Erchamion.**Mon Mar  6 06:53:22 1995 | [Dent]: Apprenticeship?:**Ok, I am confused.  How does joining work exactly now.  I though they were apprenticed at level 3, and turned Undead at level 5.  If I am wrong (or right), let me know.  Thanks.*lick*Dent**Tue Mar  7 05:58:17 1995 | [Beren]: Ok, APPRENTICESHIP in DETAILS.:**Hey, guys! :)Ok, about apprenticeship, there is NO MORE apprenticeship at all.Every guy who wanta join us, should be level 5 player, and every GCcan turn him Undead or he can go to the guild room and join.Guys who are apprentices RIGHT NOW, they should abandon. On level 5 theycan be turned Undead. I think I explained myself clear enough :)More questions?

I also have a few questions for myfellow GC's.1. What do we want? Do we want the guild fixed? Do we want the	guild closed? I think we need to start working one way or	the other.2. How many of you are there? I know there is Francesco and Lacey.	Anyone else?3. Is there anything I should be doing as GC? Or is it just	a privelege?Still waiting for something to happen,Mufasa.**Sun Jun 30 20:26:20 1996 | [Jb]: ricci:**    There have been many complaints about ricci.Most have expressed that they want toget rid of him from the guild.He has been causing problems among guildmembers.I suggest that he be banished from the guild.    Thank you for you time.                           JB**"
