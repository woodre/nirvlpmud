Spell Name: speed
Guild Lvl : 2nd

Syntax    : speed
Descript. : Ok, it's not a drug, guys. Hey Hey Hey? Did I hear a "too bad!"??
            *grin* Serious now =). This spell gives you a speedster that is
	    an object that allows you to save sequences of movements so u
	    can repeat them with just one command, the speedster is autoloading
	    so you will have to spend the spell points once. Look at it for
	    a more accurate help.
