     I have been given the job of changing all the quests so that the cheat
sheets floating around do not accurately reflect the solutions.  I made some
changes to locations of items but left your quest basically intact.  Any
rooms that needed more than just an exit change, I copied over with same
name except I added an 'E' to the front.  Specifically, I moved the amulet
room to south of the grafitti room.  I moved the cloak room from doe1 to
dog2 but I also added to 'fake' mirror rooms.  I also moved the statue room
from so that it was gotten to differently.  I hope this doesn't cause too
much of an inconvenience.  If you have any questions, please feel free to
either contact me or mail me and I'll do my best to answer them.
