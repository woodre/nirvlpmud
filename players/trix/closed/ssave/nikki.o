descriptor "Vlad is a newbie eating dragon. He stands 20 ft tall and 30 meters    long. His sleek black scaled skin shines so brightlyyou are blinded by it.He picks you up by the scruff of the neck and peers deeply intoyour soul with hellish eyes.He breathes a puff of black smoke in your face and then chucklesevilly, setting you down in front of his enormousstructure. He spreads his wings to their fulllength giving you a glance of his red stomach. As you lookclosely you think you see the picture of Dante'sInferno and then he closes his wings."
