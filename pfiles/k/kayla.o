description "wears her heart on her sleeve.  She is perhaps the sweetest girl you will ever meet. Sometimes she is too sweet for her own good. Kayla is beautiful and pure, and would never knowingly hurt anyone. She has been hurt many times as a result of her goodness, but is determined not to become jaded and bitter. Don't mistake her kindess for naiveity, as she can easily see who you are and what you are about... "
