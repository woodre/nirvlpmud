description "shifts his weight in a manner that would appear casual to some, while fidgety to others, from one densely chocolate-pelted leg to the other, each ending in a well-worn ebon hoof. He raises a lithe, furry- knuckled hand to his waist, tugging at a length of metallic chain that encircles his body at the juncture of his relatively smooth abdomen and his hirsute lower half.  His fingers alight upon a small circle of copper- ringed glass, a monocle, which he raises to one verdant eye to give you a cursory glance, his eyebrows arching momentarily in brief curiosity below the nubby horns protruding from his forehead before he again lets the chain fall, returning to his previous nonchalant (or squirmy) stance. "
