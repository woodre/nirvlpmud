description "stands before you, a vision of beauty. Her long curley copper hair hangs in ringlets that cover most of her pale white face. She is dressed in a long black cloak, that flows freely over her body. A beautiful silver locket hangs around her neck, with a small picture of three young children placed carefully inside it. On her left ring finger a sliver wedding band. Etched on the outter side of the ring there is an inscription that reads "A moutain holds its echo deep within its self. This is how I hold your voice." Cricket moves with a slow steady grace that only a woman of the night could posses. As you gaze at her, a chill of evil runs up your spine. She grins at you, exposing her razer sharp ivory fangs.Cricket is a mistress of the night."
