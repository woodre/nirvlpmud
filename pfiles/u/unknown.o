description " appears to be a darkly cloaked figure, its robes lay tattered with a touch of dust around the hem.  You notice there is no disturbance of the robe when he moves around.  Yellowed boned hands hang limply at his side.  A rictus grin betrays no hint of emotion.  Two raw chunks of smoking darkly glowing stones exist where normal eyes would exist.  His gaze sends makes you take a step back as you cannot keep your gaze on him. "
