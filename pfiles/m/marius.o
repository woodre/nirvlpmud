description "is walking towards you as you notice the glint in his steelblue eyes.  "Should I turn & flee?" you wonder.  Somethingin his gaze prevents you from even looking away, let alone running.  The muscles rippling under his black leather vest is akin to watching the waves lap at the shoreline, begging to beset free from their confines.  The black leather pants he wears donothing to hide his equally muscled lower body.  The last thing youremember before the darkness sets in is seeing the fresh red blooddripping from his pearly white fangs as he lowers his mouth to your neck.The last thought "If this isn't heaven, I would exist in damnation forever." "
