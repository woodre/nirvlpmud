description "is a half wolf half dog with a few words of advise...There are two days in every week about which we should not worry.  Two days whick should be kept from apprehension.One of these days is yesterday with it's mistakes and cares, it's faults and blemishes, it's aches and pains.  Yesterday has passed forever and beyond our control.  All the money in the world cannot bring back yesterday.  We canno erase a single word we said.  Yesterday is gone.The other dayt we should not worry about is tomorrow with it's possible adversoties, it's blunders, it's large promises, and poor performance.  Tomorrow is also beyond our immediate control.Tomorrow sun will rise either in slender or behind a mask of clouds-but it will rise.  Until it does, we have no stake in tomorrow, for it is yet unborn.This leaves only one day-Today.  Any person can fight the battles of just one day.  It is only when you and i add the burden of those two awful aternities-Yesterday and Tomorrow-that we break down.It is not the experience of today that drives us mad-it is the remorse or bitterness for something which happened yesterday and the dread of what will happen tomorrow"
