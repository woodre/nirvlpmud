description "is a slender, lithe muscled elf with a mane of long silver hair. Her pale skin is decorated with numerous swirling and runic tattoos done in varying shades of black and crimson. Around her eyes are a pair of dark tattoos that resemble the shadows of spread feathered wings trailing down the line of her jaw almost giving her a strange masked appearance. From her back sprouts a apir of magnificent wings, the feathers of which have been carefully dyed black and tipped with crimson. Her dark crimson eyes sparkle with intensity as cold as ice and almost seem to pierce the soul and at night they shine with an eerie glow in the moonlight."
