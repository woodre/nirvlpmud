description "is a mysterious-looking, forboding creature, dressedin very menacing yet sharp-looking black attire.  His long,dark hair makes it hard to make out his face, and the rest ofhim is covered up with a fine tuxedo and long black cape.While his face may be hard to see in the darkness, you canmake out a pair of long, sharp, white fangs hanging from hisblood-red lips.  He has held up extremely well over the yearsand has a timeless quality about him.  You sense that he isvery quick and alert, and he appears like he could strike atany moment.  You feel like someone is hearing your thoughts...."
