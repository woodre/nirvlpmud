description "Solitare is a creature of myth.  An eldar from another time that has taken upon himself a ritual to stave off 'She-who-thirsts' and now wanders the realms fighting 'her' minions eternally.  He wears a muted grey hooded cloak that seems to enhance his already formidable stance. His form seems to waver and shift never appearing entirely stable, yet he stands there. A mirrored reflective mask adorns his face, it hides his features but it also reflects the lookers greatist fears back at them.  His soulles stare from within the mask chills your spine, and you find yourself looking away.  "
