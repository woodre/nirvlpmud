description "is a Moo Cow of the highest order.  He is covered in attractively arranged black spots which perfectly ofset the white backdrop of his fur.  He has two well manicured 6" horns that extend evenly from either side of his well developed mellon.  He walks about on his hind legs and sports a perfectly designed velvet-lined marsupial pouch which covers most of his mid section.  His hooves are well groomed and look extrememly sharp as he uses them for battle periodically.  From his pouch a thick gold watch chain sticks out hanging down a few inches.  As you look at him he extends a friendly moo and bids you a good day."
