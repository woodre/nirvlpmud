Long, straight, sandy-blond hair frames his thin, clean-shaven face and falls to his shoulders. A royal blue tunic with green trim is draped loosely over his slender frame and cinched around his narrow waist with a wide belt of brown leather. A pair of form-fitting black pants and knee-high brown leather boots adorn his legs. His trusty lute is strapped to his back, always at the ready for when he feels the need for song. "
