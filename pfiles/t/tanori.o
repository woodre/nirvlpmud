description "fucking LOVES this song--> hope dangles on a string, like slow spinningredemption, winding in & winding out, the shine of which has caught myeye & roped me in, so mesmerizing, so hypnotizing, i am captivated, i amvindicated, i am selfish, i am wrong, i am right, i swear i'm right, i swear i knew it all along and i am flawed, but i am cleaning up so well i am seeingin me now the things you swore you saw yourself so clear, like the diamondin your ring, cut to mirror your intentions, oversized and overwhelmedthe shine of which has caught my eye and rendered me so isolated, somotivated i am certain now that i am.......vindicated"
