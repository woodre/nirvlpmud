description "is a tall, walking decomposing corpse. His flesh looks like flaking leather, and smells like old dirt. The bright white bones of his skeleton peak through the rotting flesh in spots. The bottom right half of his face has lost all its flesh, and now only that portion of his skull and teeth can be seen through it. The most notable thing about this walking corpse is a long dark red scar on the left side of his face, that runs from his forehead to his jaw line. It is said that when he was alive a hex was placed on him by an old Indian chief. It is said that he was cursed to walk the earth long after his death, even after this body would decompose. Hex, a name he adopted after his death, has embraced the Realm of Death.  "
