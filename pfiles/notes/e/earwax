have some mobs become ghosts when they die.....hell, mebbe kill them again :)
emote contest, revisited...barrywhite emote, .....
combat dummy...ok,...this really needs to happen:  a realistic combat dummy, one that hits back, settable ac, settable damage, so that we can see what guilded players actually are inflicting, and taking vs mobs, and variety of mob types (low/high wc/ac, special damage, multiple hits, etc)....that way we can make a realistic omparison of guilds forsake of balance.....if one guild is doing more damage against all mob types than another yet taking less, the two are not balanced
emote: pullmyfinger, .....also heals that give gas, lower price perhaps, slightly
