description " has a quiet strength and brooding expression which are tempered by the benevolence evident in his gaze. Adorned in plain, yet exquisitely crafted grey armor and a flowing scarlet cape, he has the countenance of a God and a striking figure which draws the eye.  Boltar exudes a charismatic confidence that leads others inexorably to follow him. [0m[1m[5m[33m[40m You can't mess with a God[0m"
