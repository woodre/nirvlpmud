description "is a puritan in her own right. Truth be told, the simple sight of her truth and purity takes your breath away. With long flowing blonde hair and curvature that is hidden with in a cloak she looks deadly. Yet the kindness in her eyes makes you feel at ease. You look away when she catches you and a kind smile wipes across her face followed by a subtle nod. Not knowing what to do next you simply nod back while your face burns with embarrassment. None the less you were noticed by the charmingly breathtaking elf and that was simply enough. You recall the dream like incident  simply as, Blameless. "
