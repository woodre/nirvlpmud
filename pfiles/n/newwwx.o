description "is a Dark Elf that noone really sees.  She walks very quitely so not to be heard.  As you gaze upon her you notice that she wears nothing cept the blackcloak and hood that you see.  As you look closer you notice a skull and crossbones tattoo over her right shoulder and on her left a odd looking staff tattoo.  The staff tattoo has writing you cannot understand and you wonder what does it mean.  Her cloak is held closed with a golden rope with strange symbols written onit.  You notice upon farther gazing that she wears silver ring on her fingers and golden necklaces around her neck.  The biggest of the rings seems to be a pentacle and the necklace is a tight fitting choker that bears the same pentacle symbol as the ring"
