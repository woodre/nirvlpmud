description "stands before you as a normal man.He is wearing black nylon pants, with 3 red stripes down the side of them. His T-shirt is sleaveless, and is white. It has big black letters on the front that read " The Truth is Out There ".One has a small tattoo on his forehead. It looks arabic.His hair is cut short, but there is a braded pony-tail in the back. It is about shoulder length. He is real clean shaven. He is built evenly, not to muscular, but not thin either.His shoes are as white as the clouds in the sky on a sunny day. They have 3 red stripes going down the side of them.His eyes are pitch black, however. You think that it may be contacts, but your wrong. :)"
