description "the Renegade stands here.  Rarely out in the open, even rarer for him to be out of the shadows, you can catch a rare glimpse at one of the most lethal of the CyberNinja.  Standing a touch over six feet tall, and extremely bulky even at that height, he's far from what one might expect a CyberNinja - a practioner of the Ninjitsu art of stealth and assassination - to look like.  Standing on the balls of his feet, his eyes searching constantly, the haft of his famous kusari-gama gripped lightly in one hand shows his readiness to enter combat at all times, however.Orb was once a proud leader of the CyberNinja.  Over time, the apathy and lack of honor amongst his fellow ninja wore on him, however, until one day he finally renounced his positions and stepped aside to become a renegade.  As such, he still follows his own honor, but no longer has any compunctions about killing those who he feels have none.  If you live without honor, or are an enemy to the CyberNinja, watch your back, for this man will gladly plant his blade there."
