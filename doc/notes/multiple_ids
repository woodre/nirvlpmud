Vertebraker [10.1.03]

Any object inheriting /obj/weapon, /obj/armor, or /obj/treasure
may now call the SetMultipleIds()/QueryMultipleIds() function.
It's integrated fully into the id() lfuns of those objects.

Example:

  set_name("bosco");
  set_alias("bosco bubba");
  SetMultipleIds(({"guy", "bubba", "chief bubba"}));


So obviously id() still works just perfectly with name, alias, race, etc,
but it now also accepts a near-infinite number of arguments in one
compact little package without having to screw internally with id()

Let me know if you have any questions.
