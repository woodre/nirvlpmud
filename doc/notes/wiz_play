Something I am going to allow if everyone can be adult about it and
not cheat. I've never minded it in the past so long as the wizard 
didn't cheat, so it's really not a change, just changing it from 
quasi-legal to explictly so. 

You may have your wizard character and real player character on at 
the same time. However, if you cheat then it will be considered just
as serious as it has always been. 

I think most people know better, and considering that we don't have
anywhere near capactity player wise it's not a waste of login spots.
If we get crowded again this may be suspended for that reason.
If people can't be adults and live up to simple don't cheat rule then it 
may ruin it for everyone.
