 As many may know, I am at the edge of how much more I can take. 
The only way too keep the mud fun enough for me to keep it going
is to simply stomp out the agitators and people who come around 
just to make others miserable.  This is why dazed, symbio, etc are
in their current state, it got to the point where I stomped them 
or shut down the mud, so they got stomped. From now on there is a 
zero tolerance for the harrassment as far as I am concerned, I 
will warn, and then the player gets put into prison or banished.

I don't care if it means losing players, because it's them or me. 

What does this mean to average wizard? If someone reports harrassment 
the harrasser gets one warning to stop. He doesn't he gets locked up.
If the report is unfounded or is being provoked by the person reporting
the person reporting gets thrown into the prison. 

I hate that it has come to this, but it's the only thing I can 
do to keep the mud good for me.
