favors for players, 3-Jun-98

I no longer wish wizards to give players special titles, pretitles, 
or anything of the sort. Players have become very annoying 
asking/demanding me to do these things and I am sure other wizards 
have had to put up with similiar behavior. 

Thusly, it will no longer be allowed.
