Vital [5.6.04]

      It's great to see all of the new wizards and hear about all
of the wonderful ideas they have planned for their areas. You all
are a creative bunch who will greatly enrich the Nirvana
worldscape.

        In order to facilitate this for you, if you are logged in as
a wizard, do not log in as a player character and vice versa.
Until you get your first area finished and approved, there are
too many distractions and conflicts. This will both protect you
and your position as a creative member of Nirvana's development
team, and will reduce the chances of being caught up in previous
mentioned distractions and conflicts.

        So, to recap: Level 21's - either log in as a wiz or as a
player, not both until your initial coding project is finished
and approved.

        Thanks, Administration
