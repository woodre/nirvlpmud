Bolts [9.5.03?]

Look, I have said it a dozen times or more:

DO NOT HAND PLAYERS CLONED GUILD OBJECTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


I am sick and tired of pasting together player files that get wiped from
wizards handing guild objects to players.

EACH AND EVERY GUILD *MUST* have a method where a player self-restores
his guild object. The player must know what this is. 

I swear, if I have to fix another player file for this someone is 
getting demoted.
