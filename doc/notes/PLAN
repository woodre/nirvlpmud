Feldegast [5.20.??]

You may've noticed while fingering some wizzes that they
now have an additional 'Plan' field.  This field is created
by making a file named PLAN in your root directory.  You
should list your current projects in this file so that others
know what you're working on and know not to poach your work.
It can also be used to announce that you'll be gone a while,
or how much you love your seniors.  Please, try not to make
them very long.  No more than 5-6 lines.

At the moment, wizards under level 40 will not be able to
see these files.  Sorry guys.

Somebody asked and now somebody gets.
You can now set your plan that can be viewable
by players, or, not.  Put a file in /open/pub_plans/
named "yourname.plan"  i.e.  vertebraker.plan

And let's be civil and not edit everyone else's :)
