Logging of players...
I have decided that all logging must be approved by me. 
Odds are I will also decide the manner of logging and where the log will
be. 
This is not because logging has been abused. I've found that wizards have
been highly selective in who gets bugged. I cannot think of a case of a 
non-deserving bug in years now. However, there is an image issue at 
hand that is being played off. We log worm, it goes through the rumor
mill and comes off that mizan is logging anyone who doesn't like him. 

Therefore, I think this policy is needed. 

Any questions ask. I expect complaince as soon as reasonably possible.

PS. logging yourself is your own business and I don't care about
that.
