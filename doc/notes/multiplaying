Multiplaying [3.9.??] by Boltar

I think the hunt is getting out of control. If you, as 
a wizard cannot tell the differance between a PPP or SLIP
assigned IP and that of a multi-user machine, do not enforce
the rule. There are lots of people who still log in via
multi-user machines. The same IP does not always equal the
same person. I would prefer that some people go unpunished 
for multiplay, rather than have every person who decided
to play with a friend from a multi-user machine at a school
be harrassed.
