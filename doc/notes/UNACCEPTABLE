Bolts [12.8.04]

If I find out who is leaking transcripts of the wizard channel to 
the players. You WILL be DEWIZED.

There are things players shouldn't know because taken out of context, or 
by those not wizards, will lead to misunderstandings. I am dealing with
one now. Someone who isn't playing anymore in part because of it. 

wizard info is for wizards only.
