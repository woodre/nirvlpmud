Feldegast [12.1.01]

I want everybody who has a password that would be in the dictionary
to change their password to something that is an acronym, preferably
with both letters and numbers.  Its idiotic that we're still letting
ourselves get hacked like this when we know there's somebody out there
gunning for us.  Sure, we can't defend against everything, but we shouldn't
make it easy for him either.
