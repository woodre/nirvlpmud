Vital [1.14.04]

Just another FYI note: I have updated several of the docs
in the /open/vital/doc directory. As always, I am always 
open to suggestions to make it easier for new coders to 
get up to speed as quickly as possible and improve their
craft and skills.

Several of you have made suggestions already, and they
are in the new docs. Due to the big response on different 
tools for accomplishing your coding, I'd like to invite
all of you who use ftp/text editing in your work flow to
contribute any comments/reviews of your process to allow
the greatest range of options for new wizards. This is
specifically related to work flow tools and comments on
what works for you.

Also, as before, this is a work in progress and so some 
of the information is better than other parts of it,
which is something that I am continually working to 
reduce to null [possible?].

p.s. I would also like to take this moment to again make
one recommendation, /open/vital/doc/02_style.txt is very
helpful in creating good code and making it easy for any
other person to help you later on.
