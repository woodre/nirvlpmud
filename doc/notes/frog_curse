If a player is having trouble carrying more than half of their 
usual capacity, then it is probably due to the frog curse.  
Usually this sets a player's title, but it's easy enough to reset titles,
and then the player doesn't realize that they are a frog because there's 
no other indication.  This is not a bug.  
If you want to diagnose a player, check query_frog() in the player object.
