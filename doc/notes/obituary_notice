Llew [6.19.03]

I made a slight change to my obituary notice.  It now has an exclusion
list for test characters and such.  My tester was dying too much and filling
the log with stuff I didn't want players to see.  If you want to add to the
list, it is /players/llew/Other/misc/deathlog.c or let me know and I'll add
a name to the list.

Note: In Llew's seeming continual absence, mail a Senior.
