If you do not know how to fix a persons guild object correctly, DO NOT ATTEMPT T
O DO IT.
Rangers have a guild restore function inside the guild hall.  They can look at G
lobe if they need to know what it is.
Do not under any circumstances clone them a guild object.  Because I have a floa
ting skill system, their object is almost
complety impossible to reconstruct by hand correctly.
If a Ranger loses their guild object, please tell them to read the Globe for how
 to restore it.
Thanks.
Beck
