Guild Format 1 - Directories/files <mythos 3-15-98>
  
  * Guild files are not to be placed in closed dirs but rather
    in /players/<whoever>/guild dir.  This makes it easier for
    us to know exactly where the guild files are stored.
    
  * All files should be named with filenames that state exactly
    what that file is.  Example: guildhall.c, masterobject.c, etc
  
  * The following is a sample guild dir format:
     note: * denotes file all others are otherwise directories
  
                     /players/<whoever>/guild

    Note:  Please follow the above as closely as you can (this includes the
           actual names of dirs and files)
           
    Details: power is the dir in which the guild powers as .h files are placed
             such powers are included into the guilddaem.c and called thru
             the guildob.c
             example:
             in guildob.c
              
               function_in_guildob() {
                 guilddaem->function_in_guilddaem();
               }
             
             in guilddaem.c
               
                #include "power/function_in_guilddaem.h"
             
             in power dir
               
                in function_in_guilddaem.h
               
                  function_in_guilddaem() { do_the_function; }
                  
    Note: Though there are various ways to code a guild object and its powers
          the above way is highly recommended as it makes viewing the files
          and functions easier.
