Guild Combat Spells

Added heal_self() -Bp 20-Aug-98
 
Guild spells may be based upon two lines, the first is the prefered line
and it follows the basic game spells. The second line are those spells 
which call hit_player() directly to do damage. 
The Basic game spells are as follows:
level 5 missile, damage random(20) cost 10
level 10 shock, damage random(30) cost 15
level 15 fireball, damage random(40) cost 20
level 19+5 sonic, damage 12+random(33) cost 25
 
NOTE: no spell is to be more powerful than sonic.

these spells follow a 1 sp per point of stright damage, 1/2 sp per point
of random damage. They differ from hit_player() direct spells because
of how the combat is coded and the damage cap.
 
For basic game spells, and those using spell_object() (a function in
living.c that allows guild spells to work as basic game spells)
the damage cap is 50 per round for weapon hit and spell hit.
 
hit_player() calling spells on the other hand have a separate call to 
hit_player() from the weapon hit. thus, two calls or a combined damage
cap of 100. hence they must follow this chart.
 
     cost                             damage
        1 sp                              1 pt random damge
        2-3 sp                            1 pt damage

heal_self() has been used for damage by some. This SHOULD NOT be
done unless there is no other way! Consult a senior wiz before
using it. Cost will be as follows:

     cost                             damage
        1-2 sp                            1 pt random damge
        3 sp                              1 pt damage

there must ALWAYS be a random element to the spell that is greater than
non-random element.
   this means the bulk of the damage must come from the random part.
   i.e. 10+random(30) is good 30+random(10) is NOT

using the hit_player chart 10+random(30) would cost between 50 and 60 sp
 
the cost is double, because of damage potential is double. 
 
lastly,
Area effect spells or multi-monster spells must have an sp cost based 
on the TOTAL damage done to all monsters based on the system above.
these are basic guidelines.... devations based ok'd by aproval.\
 
 
APPENDIX 5-7-96
Fixed item cost sp reduction math, now 30coins. (60/2) -Bp 20-aug-98

delays: 
   time delays between spells can give the following cost savings in
spell points for the player. I will set this at 2 sp for every one
minute they cannot cast another guild spell.
 
sacrifices:
 based on a 1 pt heal = 60 coins. A 1pt heal = 1sp & 1hp.
   these too can be used to lower the sp cost. their value is what they
cost the player in coins/30. this keeps it in line with healing costs.
so a sacrifice that cost 300 coins would be worth a 10 sp savings.
but the spell must be blocked without the sacrifice. 
Items found on monsters etc will have to have their savings set up
based on the monster and will need evaluation on a case by case basis.
 
NEITHER of these can lower the cost of a spell below 65% of its standard
cost.
NO spell drawback justifies spell power beyond the limit of the rules.
