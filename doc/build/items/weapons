Weapons:

We all want players to like our areas, but with weapons you must be ESPECIALLY
vigalent in thier design. Here are some simple rules to guide you in thier
construction.

1. Any weapon with a wc 17 and over, or a special hit over 7 MUST have a defect
   to draw away from the weapon. Use your imagination for these drawbacks. Here
   are a few of ideas: Make the weapon real heavy, have the weapon cost sp or hp
   when the special attack is done, put alignment restrictions on it, ect.
   The better the weapon, the more severe the draw back. 

2. Remember your theme when crafting your weapons. Every weapon does not have to
   be an exceptional weapon. With some clever use of description and inovation
   even the lamest of weapons can look like they are very deadly. 

3. Good weapons (i.e. powerfull weapons) should be exctremely rare. Players 
   should have to bid on them with each other. They shouldn't be so common that
   they are given out to newbies like they are now. Keep this in mind when you
   are designing them.
