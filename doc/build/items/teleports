Teleportation Devices:

A teleportation device is an item that allows a player to transfer from one
place to another without entering the intervening rooms. This file concerns
only items that give this power. Guild teleports will be covered later.

1. All teleports will be location based. There will be NO player to player
   teleportation. This means an item that brings the player to the church is
   fine; however, an item that teleports johny to billy is illegal.

2. All teleport items should have a limited amount of uses. When all the uses
   are done, the item should destruct. I suggest no more than 10 uses per item.

3. All teleport items MUST check for the realm() function of the destination
   and leaving room to check for non teleport areas. Failure to do this will
   NOT be accepted.

4. The cost of the items for now will be left up to your common sense;
   however, here are some aspects to consider. If the item costs the players
   sp,hp,coins,ect. per each use, then its cost can be decreased. If the
   device has the chance of not working, or working incorectly it too can have
   a lower price. Use your imagination. A teleportation device is a type of
   magic, and magic is by no means an exact science.
 
5. Teleportation devices and settable tellports are not to be guild
features. Guilds may have a fixed teleport command for rescue with
a basic cost of  55+random(5)sp.
