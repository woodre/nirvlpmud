OBJECT
        All objects can use this.

SYNOPSIS
        string query_auto_load()

DESCRIPTION
        This line is used for objects that you want to load automatically
        after re-boots, or at login. There are certain rules for the object in
        question to follow:
        1) It can't have a weight
        2) It can't be dropped
        3) It has to be loaded BEFORE the player logs in (Or the player
            won't get a copy)
        4) query_auto_load must return a string in the format:
                        filename:arg
            Where 'filename' is the name of the file to autoload, and 'arg' is a
            string that will be sent to 'init_arg()' ('arg' can be = 0)
        5) This should not be used for weapons, or armors.
     

        The basic idea behind query_auto_load is for players to to recieve a curse,
        poision that must be cured, memberships ie. guild obj, pin of completed work ect...
        

EXAMPLE
        string query_auto_load() { return "/players/angel/belt:"; }
   
        
        This should autoload the object 'belt' when the player with it logs on.
        
        
        The autoload must be added into your castle, which looks like:
        
        
        reset(arg) {
          if (arg)
            return;
              move_object(this_object(), DEST);
  
       call_other("/players/angel/belt.c","XXX");
       }
