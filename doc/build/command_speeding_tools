A popular item to make, is a speedster or some other command for 
players which allows them to do multiple actions in the same heart
beat. However, there are serious problems with this in an unlimited manner.
The first is that a single player may be able to hog the mud's command
processing time, actually increasing lag. The second is a unfair advantage
in combat.
 
The following restrictions are on 'speedsters'

1) Only MOVEMENT commands are allowed. No combat or any other sort of 
command is permitted.

2) A limit of FIVE (5) commands is to be strictly enforced. Only 
5 commands must be able to chained together.
 
3) The movement commands should be limited to standard directions,
n,s,e,w,nw,sw,se,ne,u,d. If not limited to those, some other 
code MUST be in place to ensure that the speedster is ONLY
used for MOVEMENT. That a player cannot alias what is typically 
a movement command to a combat command then use it in the speedster
for instance.
