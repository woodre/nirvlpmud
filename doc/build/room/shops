Shops
1-23-97 Bp


All shops are to give the value returned from query_value() 
in the object being sold or less for items worth less than 1000 coins.
For objects worth 1000 coins or more the shop may pay out the 
value or 1000+random(400) coins. whichever is LESS.
For example an object worth 1250 coins. 1000+random(400) generates
a value of 1043. the player gets 1043. if on the other hand 1000+random(400)
generated a value of 1343, the player would get 1250.
An object worth 1400 or more will ALWAYS get the result of 
1000+random(400);
