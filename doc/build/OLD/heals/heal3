Multi-use intox heals.
Added Wocket/Snow guidelines, -Bp 24-May-99

Multi-use intox heals are to follow this chart rather than the chart 
for single use heals in heal1. -Bp

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an expansion to Wocket's original idea of fair healing / tox ratios
for multi-use heals.  The problem was that, though healing amount remained
constant, total heal tox increased with higher-use, lower healing heals.
For example, a 5-use, 30 heal, 10 tox would tox a total of 50 while healing
150 whereas a 3-use, 50 heal, 10 tox would tox a total of 30 while healing
150. This proposes a total tox / total heal ratio for cost to replace the
current per-use tox cost as detailed below.

TotalIntox/TotalHeal 		Cost per heal pt.
	.40+    			 6
	.35   				 8
	.31      			 9
	.28    			 	10
	.26     			11
	.24     			12
	.22     			13
	.20     			14
	.18     			15
	.16     			16
	.14     			18
	.12     			20
	.08     			25
	.04-    			30

With this table, a 5-use, 30 heal, 10 tox would cost 50/150 = .3 = 10 coins
per heal point for a total of 1500 coins. A 3-use, 50 heal, 10 tox would cost
30/150 = .2 = 14 coins per heal point for a total of 2100 coins.

Note: I did add 2 cost categories at the top and 2 at the bottom to
accommodate the wider range of intox provided by this method.
Note2: Wizzes should round to the _higher_ price on the scale.
