Healing Items on Monsters:

In heal1, we dealt with healing cost of purchased healing. This file deals 
with healing that you might place on a monster as treasure. Let me make
myself perfectly clear here. FULL HEALS being found on monsters (those over
50pts healing) are to be EXTREMELY rare. Most heals found on monsters seem
to be non intox, you mightt want to make them intox heals if you want to 
make them heal more. You might also want to mess around and give the item a
chance to hurt the player if you want to give it a higher heal. Remember
there should be risks in the game for great rewards.
