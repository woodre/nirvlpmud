HOW TO EXCLUDE WIZARDS FROM YOUR FILES

just have a list in your top directory called access with
one wizard name per line.

   NOTES:
   Do not exclude your wizard group leader, this wont gain you any points.
   If you put a wizard on the list of level 1000 or greater it will have no
   effect.


WARNING:
           If a filename has the string 'acces' in it, a wizard of any level
           may be able to read it, even if locked out. however he will not
           be able to edit it. This is because his player file must be able
           to read the list that locks him out.
