ARMOR--- Please do not make any non-standard armors (std:armor,helmet,boots
         ring,amulet,shield) Make the armor's protection reflect how
         difficult it was to obtain. No armor should be more protective
         than platemail <ac 4>, unless it somewhere next to impossible to get, 
         meaning that I should see a player with it no more than about once 
         every month or more.

       any non-standard armor has been made to self destruct.
       there is now a type misc that you may use to make something outside
       the six types, but there should be very few of these.
        Only type armor should be above ac 2.
        Ac 2 armors not of class armor should be rare and fairly
        difficult to get.

   note armor of class 0 or below may be of any type so long as set_ac is
        called before set type.
