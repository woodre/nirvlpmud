WIZARDS do not help nor hinder players, there have been many cases of players
advancing in levels and solving quests far too quickly. Such as level 19
and all quests solved in 10 hours.  If this continues it will only hurt your-
selves as the easier you make it for players by helping them, the less your
wizardship is worth. Players will figure out who is being helped and who
isn't, players will then feel the mud is unfair and not play. In the end
there will be nothing more than a mud full of wizards, just trying to see
who can make the best wiz toy and not creating new areas, resulting
in a dead mud. I am tired of trying to police you folks, your only hurting
yourselves by interfering with the flow of the game.
