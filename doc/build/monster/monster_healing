                       --added 10-31-91 Boltar

set monster healing with the following

         call_other(monsterob, "set_heal", healrate, healinv);

     healrate is the number of hit pts healed per call.
     healinv is the aprox. number of seconds between calls

example: call_other(thing, "set_heal", 2,25);

   monster thing will heal 2 hp about every 25 seconds.
   for comparison, at present players heal 1 hp + bonuses for intox, etc
    about every 15 seconds.

if you dont want your monster to heal use a healrate of 0 and a 
  healinv thats faily high, (say 100) so that the autoheal isnt called
too much to add 0 to the hit_point

default is healrate of 1 healinv of 40
