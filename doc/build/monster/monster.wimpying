Sometimes when you code a monster that will wimpy, you will
notice that it tries, but doesn't run.  Feldegast pointed
out that usually this is caused by the fact that "monsters
are typically moved into a room before the exits are set for
the room, so they don't received the add_action that will
allow them to leave the room."

"The easiest way to fix this is to clone the monster to the room
 AFTER you set the exits."
