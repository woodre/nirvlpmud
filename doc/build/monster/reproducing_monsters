reproducing monsters. there have been a number of problems
with this the last few months. I want the following.
some sort of limit on how many exist at a time or
some type of population control.
my squirrels for instance not only reproduce, but self destruct.
this was tned so that they would always have a moderate population.
you can do something like this. or use some sort of hard coded counter.
in any case they cannot be allowed to be cloned without some limiting
factor.
