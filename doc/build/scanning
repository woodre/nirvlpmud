scanning of objects



It has been quite popular to allow players to judge the quality 
of weapons and armor, monsters, etc.

The basic rule with such items is that a player never get the game
numbers for ac,wc,hp,etc. There should always be descriptive words
such as strong, weak, etc. 
 
The minimum costs of a scanning tool or ability should be 50 coins per
use or at least 10sp in the case of a spell. Of course the more detailed
the information the higher the cost. An object which does scanning 
should not last more 10 uses if it can be bought freely. If the item
is a treasure for a quest or other difficult puzzle, adjustments can be made.
