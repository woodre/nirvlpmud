As part of an ongoing documentation project, this directory will 
contain updated examples and code snippets for things that don't
necessarily fit in with the various other directories.  In some 
cases there may be examples both in here and in the subdir itself.

If you have something that you feel is a good example or belongs 
here, or something that should have an example given in here, feel
free to mudmail or email me or any other seniors regarding it.
