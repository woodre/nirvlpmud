Okay, I'm requesting that everyone register
their test characters with the new datafile/daemon
system I wrote.  All you have to do is log on the test
character and type "add_testchar <testchar>" with
your wizard. The code takes care of the rest.

And btw, all you have to do in order to query whether
a player is a testchar is do a:

  if(ob->is_testchar())  ..

/obj/play/testchar.h holds some relevant
functions.

/obj/user/testchar-d.c is the daemon.

Currently registering your testchar automatically
puts a msg in short(), as well as finger, and registers
him to a listing in the wiz cmd "testchars".

Ok, I also forgot, it won't log your testchar to
the top reboot xp list or run in xp contests...
mm.. some other things I won't mention.

Anyway, just do the friggin' thing, it takes two
seconds.

To recap:
1] Login test character.
2] Type 'add_testchar <testcharname>'.
3] Ok, no real step 3, but you can type 'testchars'
   to make sure it worked.

Thanks, and mazeltov.
