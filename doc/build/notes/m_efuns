Vertebraker: [5.13.02]

I just added my m_efuns such as colour_pad(), etc
into simul_efun [You may find a copy in /obj/simul_efun/m_efuns.c],
and they are documented in /open/verte/std/m_efuns.txt

If you are calling my m_efuns file from anywhere, it will
remain there for a while, but you should just take out the call
and replace it since it's now an efun.
