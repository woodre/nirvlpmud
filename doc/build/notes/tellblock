I have made it easy for people to add tellblock 
support to any command. simply replace tell_object()
with tell_object_wblock(). It takes the same arguements.
the code can be found at the end of /obj/simul_efun.c
It supports the possible expanison of tell_block to  a list
of names, but currently that is not supported in player.c
it works with the present system.
send any comments or notice of odd behavior to me.

You peoples now have no excuse for your private communication commands 
not to support tell block
