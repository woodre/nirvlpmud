Bolts [10.5.04]

armors and weapons now support different values for buying and selling.
the regular set_value() will do the value used for the player to sell
the item. 
set_buy_value() will set the base value used by the shop  to determine
how much to sell it for. 
query_value(); and query_value(1); return the regular value (sell)
query_value(2); returns the buy value. 

Only the village shop supports this until people start rolling the support 
into their own shops.
those that use the village shop storeroom will support it because they are
using the back end of the village shop.
