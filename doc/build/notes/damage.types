Verte [5.21.01]

Boltar okay'd a general table of other| dmg types
Zeus and I drew up, so we can be consistent in our code.

/doc/build/dtypes

is the doc if you wouldn't mind taking a look
and using them where appropriate.
If you are unsure how to use damage types,
consult /open/beck/damagetype.txt
or you better ax somebody :)
