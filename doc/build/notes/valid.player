You can check for the validity of a player name
with an sfun i wrote,

int flag;
flag = valid_player("yoyo");

Flag should return 0 since there isn't currently
a player Yoyo.

flag = valid_player("boltar");
Flag should return 1 since Boltar *is* a player,
[well, a wizard/GOD anyway].

Anyway, you can do wizard checks as well,
the associated functions are in

/obj/simul_efun/valid_player.c

  while the code itself is in

/obj/user/valid_player.c
