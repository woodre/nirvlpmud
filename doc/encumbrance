CONCEPT
    Encumbrance

DESCRIPTION
    Encumbrance is a means to differ the weight of certain objects
    more exactly. An encumbrance of 2500 correlates to a weight of 1.
    However, encumbrance is not to be understood as exactly the weight
    of an object as in the case of query_weight() or set_weight(). An
    object that can easier be handled than another can have a different
    encumbrance although their weight may be the same.

EXAMPLE
    If you have for instance a dagger with a weight of 1, then a
    leaflet or sheet of paper should not necessarily have a weight
    of 1 as well. Better give it an encumbrance of less than 2500,
    thus making it lighter than the dagger.
