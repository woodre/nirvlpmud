int drop(silently)
int silently;

This function must be defined by all objects that want to control when they
can be dropped. if 'silently' is true, then don't write any messages.

drop() should return 1 to prevent dropping. This is the opposit
of the get() function. That is because if drop() is not defined, it will
always be possible to drop an object.
