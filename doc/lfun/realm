               **Documentation for realm()**

Long ago, wizards created devices that could transport players anywhere
with move_object(). This made certain wizards sad when they wanted to make
rooms that players could not leave or enter via "teleportation".

In order to correct the problem some bright wizard decided that there
should be a function to call in objects (e.g. rooms) that would return
whether it was ok to telport the player to/from that object. That is
realm().

If you want to prevent players from teleporting in or out of a room,
simply add the following line to the object file (i.e. your room, etc.):

     realm() { return "NT"; }

(If other wizards have been nice, their objects will check that function
before moving players anywhere.)

If you wish to make something that will transport players, you MUST
add a call to the environment-object of the player AND the destination-
object. This call is to realm() of course, and should be included in
the function that does the moving (In your object). For example:

     move_me(who) {
          object dest, here;
          string here_realm, dest_realm;
          dest=environment(find_player(who));
          here=environment(this_player());

          here_realm=here->realm();  /* Neither of these should return "NT" */
          dest_realm=dest->realm();  /* Otherwise notify the player he fails */

     /* Now use an if to compare the values returned from both rooms... */

          if(dest_realm=="NT" || here_realm=="NT") {
               write("You fail.\n");
               return 1;
          }
          move_object(this_player(), dest);
          write("Ok.\n");
          return 1;
}

This simple function will move this_player() to the player "who", only
if niether the destination-object nor environment-object is "NT".
