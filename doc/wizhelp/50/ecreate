                     ecreate

Syntax:    ecreate

Desc:
           Launch Vertebraker's emote creator.
           Allows you to create custom emotes and put them
           in-game right away.

           Type 'h' when you are editing to bring up a list
           of possible variables, and it uses the same ANSI
           syntax as 'help moncolor'

Warning:   You cannot currently re-edit what you put in, only wipe
           it out and start all over again :(
           Also, these emotes are usable by all, so keep them
           [relatively] clean.

Example:   ecreate
		Launch emote creator.
