                     Goto

Syntax:    goto <obj>

Desc:
           This command is a wizard's primary movement ability to get
           around the mud. It is very flexible and capable of moving
           a wizard to another player or to a monster or place in 
           working directory. Available to all levels of wizard.
           
Warning:   Command will move you instantly to another point and 
           display your entry message on arrival and departure. 
           Courtesy dictates you should inquire with another wizard
           before teleporting into their workrooms. Should also not 
           randomly jump into hotel/motel rooms. Aggressive monsters
           may also take swings at you so be careful not to jump to 
           players in combat areas.


Example:   goto bob, goto hunter
                  action
           Wizard would arrive in the room of Bob or hunter.
                  if no player of that name on game will try to move
                  you to a monster of similar name.
