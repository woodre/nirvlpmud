                     Mkdir

Syntax:    mkdir <name>

Desc:
           This command creates a directory in the current directory
           or in the path specified.

Warning:   Don't make the directory name to complicated in those 
           you'll be using often. It becomes a nuisance to type.

Example:   mkdir cheese
                  results 
           directory cheese is added to current directory.
