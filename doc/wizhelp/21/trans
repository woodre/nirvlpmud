Syntax:    trans <player>

Desc:
           This is a summon command to move a player to your present
           location. Be it green or workroom. This is used to bring 
           characters to rooms that are otherwise inexcessible. It 
           should not be used to deposit characters in dangerous 
           locations or to rescue them from rooms they should get 
           themselves out of.

Warning:   Don't kidnap people that aren't expecting it. Careful not
           to pull people out of combat or other situations that are
           not to be interfered with.

Example:   trans mike
