                     Dest

Syntax:    dest <obj>

Desc:
           This is a counterpoint of clone. You use this command to 
           remove an object from your immediate surroundings or 
           inventory. Be considerate and do not dest things in public
           areas like green that are not yours or that are still in 
           use by others.

Warning:   If you dest a monster it drops all its current inventory
           as it departs so if removing a bugged monster remember 
           not to leave things for players to find. Don't dest mobs
           for players and don't dest players without good reason.

Example:   dest bag
                  results
           bag is destructed in inventory or if not present there 
           then in the room
