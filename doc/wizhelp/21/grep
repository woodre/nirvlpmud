                     Grep

Syntax:    grep <pattern> <filename>

Desc:      This command allows you to search a file for a pattern.  You can
           also use wildcards in the pattern.  The following wildcards are
           supported:
           .       Match any character.
           ^       Match begin of line.
           $       Match end of line.
           \<      Match begin of word.
           \>      Match end of word.
           [..]    Match one of the characters enclosed.
           [^ ..]  Match none of the characters enclosed. The .. are to
                     replaced by single characters or character ranges:
           [abc]   matches a, b or c.
           [ab0-9] Matches a, b or any digit.
           [^a-z]  Does not match any lowercase character.
           \c      match char c even if it's a special character.

Warning:   Using grep on overly large files (huge log files, player.c etc) 
           will not work.  It also will return non-existant file messages on
           files that user can't read due to wizard level and access.

Example:   grep 100 /WIZARDS (searches for 100, in /WIZARDS)
           grep .ragnar /WIZARDS (searches for anything with 'ragnar')
           grep BOZO* defs.h  (Searches defs.h in pwd for anything beginning
                with BOZO)
