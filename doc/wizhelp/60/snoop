                     Snoop

Syntax:    snoop <player> <reason>

Desc:
           This command allows a wizard to observe all the input done
           by the player under observation. This power is helpful in 
           diagnosing bugs and catching cheats. Should have reason to
           spy on players, for wizards its a handy way to see what 
           they are doing while you are training them.

Warning:   Players don't need to be constantly monitored.

Example:   snoop mike problem with a bug
                  results
           Bob sees all commands entered by player Mike
