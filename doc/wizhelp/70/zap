                     Zap

Syntax:    zap <player>

Desc:
           This command is to basically kill a player. It is a 
           punishment that is usually done only to the most 
           problematic players. Prison is the perferred disciplinary
           action now.
           
Warning:   Not to be done casually. Prison first.

Example:   zap mike
                  results
           Bob zaps Mike and he is slain, drops gear, and dies.
