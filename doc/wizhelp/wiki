A Nirvana Developers-only Wiki has been setup for us to DOCUMENT things.
Yes, evil documentation, but in a FUN and ORGANIC way! Create an account
for yourself at: http://nirvana.beanos.com/secret/wiki
The magic registration code is "potato_meatball"
PLEASE use your wizard name to login. Unrecognized names will be deleted
and nonmatching names might get lost when the authentication is made to
be integrated. Check it out, and have fun!
