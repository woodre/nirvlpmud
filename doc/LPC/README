this was written by Lars Pensjo, the "LP" in "LPMud", so it is old and...
well, sucks :P -VERTE

This directory contains documentation about the language used to program
objects. I tried to make it as similarr as possible to C, as many people
know how to program C. I called it LPC, to connect it to the name LPmud.

Programs in an object are compiled into a special tree form, to speed up
evaluation.

***** UPDATE - Rumplemintz *****
All files updated to docs from LDMud driver - much better documentation
