Inheritance between objects was implemented in LPmud 2.0. This feature
has not been tested extensively, so don't trust it too much.
An object can inherit all variables and functions from another object.
This is done with the declaration 'inherit "file";'. This must come before
any local variables or functions.

An example, defining a monster:

inherit "obj/monster.talk";

reset(arg) {
    set_name("troll");
    set_level(9);
    set_hp(100);
    set_wc(12);
    set_al(-60);
    set_short("A troll");
    set_long("It is a nasty troll that looks very aggressive.\n");
    set_aggressive(1);
    ::reset(0);
}
