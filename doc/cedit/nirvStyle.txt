_Tools...
  _Preferences...
    _General...
      -Tab size: I set mine to 2. I wouldn't advise anything over 4.
      -Check the box "Use spaces instead of tab." It screwed up
       my paste a few times when left unchecked.
      _Colors...
	  _Keyword colors...
          In the Nirvana keyword dictionary, [nirvana.key], I grouped
          keywords into 4 categories:
           [1] conditional statements, like if & switch
           [2] variable/return types [and extra parameters],
               like int, void, and static
           [3] efuns, like tell_object and this_player
           [4] and finally # driver calls such as #include, #define etc.
          The default color settings for Crimson seem to be a bit
          glaring.. screw around until you find something you like.
    _File...
      _Association...
        _Type in .c and .h respectively in the box next to Associate,
         then click Associate after each one. That will ensure that
         Crimson will be associated with those files when you
         double-click them on your Desktop.
      _Syntax...
        _Scroll the bar down under Syntax Types til you hit an -Empty-
         slot. For Description, key in Nirvana. Click the ... box next
         to the Lang Spec text box. Choose nirvana. Repeat this for
         the Keywords text box.
      _Filters...
        _Scroll the bar down C++. Key in Nirvana instead.

   Click Ok and get out of there.

Choose File, Open Template.. select 'nirvCode'.

Now, click Document, Syntax Type, and choose Nirvana.
Congratulations. You're customized for Nirvana LPMud. !
         
 p.s. Remember there is a spell check option in
      Crimson Editor, so no excuses! :)
