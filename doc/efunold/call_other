call_other(ob, str, arg)
object ob;
string str;

Call function in another object with an argument. The return value is
returned from the other object.  

All sorts of wild and wonderful things can happen when calling
functions in unknown objects.  Try not to assume anything about the
state of the universe if you use this function on non-standard
objects.
