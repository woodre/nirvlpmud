object find_object(name)
string name;

Find the object specified by the name and return its descriptor.  Note that
this will only work if the object already exists, and unlike a command such
as "move_object" it will fail (and return 0) if the specified name has no
currently loaded object.

Example:
object portia;

portia = find_object("players/fred/portia.c");
