CONCEPT
     files

DESCRIPTION
     As a wizard, you are working with files.  EAch file represents
     the building plan for one or more objects (except text or doc files
     of course).

     The mudlib has a root, and when working with filenames, you
     can always specify a full pathname from the root by starting
     with a '/' (slash) at the beginning of the file name.

SEE ALSO
     objects(C), create(A), reset(A)
