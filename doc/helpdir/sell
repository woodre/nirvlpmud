-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

Usage: sell <item>
       sell all
       sell <item> from <container>
       sell all from <container>

  In shops, you can sell your hard-won items for well-deserved gold
coins.  You can even use the last two variations of the command to
sell items that are inside bags without taking them out first. Of
course, you can't sell items with no value, items that can't be 
dropped, or items that you've used the keep command on.

  Note that if you sell a bag with items in it, you most likely
will not get the value of those items.  Use the keep command to
prevent this from happening by mistake.

  Please note that this help file may not apply to all shops.  The
only shop you can count on all sell commands working in is the shop
in the main village.
