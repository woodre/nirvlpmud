                    [Nirvana Reward Points]
-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

    Nirvana reward points are given to players for various
  reasons as they play the game. Just being active will gain
  some reward points, as will leading a party. Wizards may
  also award nirvana points to players for turning in bugs,
  help with testing, etc.

    Login rewards are given to users when they are active
  for a weekly period. To be considered active a player must
  gain 50% of the exp required for their next level. Once the 
  exp requirement is met nirvana points will be awarded. Please
  see the additional help files for more information on login
  rewards.
  
    Other various rewards have been implemented, such as the
  nirvana birthday award which gives double xp to a player
  when they login on their nirvana birthday!
  
    Nirvana points can be exchanged for various things.
  Seek out the old traveler if you wish to cash in your 
  Nirvana Points.
