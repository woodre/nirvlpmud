Usage: emotes
       emotes <letters>

  Without an argument, emotes will list out all the built-in
emotions available on nirvana.  If you give the command one or
more letters to work with, it will list only the emotions (if any)
starting with the letter(s) you provided.  You can also see 'help
emotions' for a list of all the built-in emotions.

  The emotions themselves are commands you can use to perform
certain built-in actions.  Some are common social actions, and
others are just plain whacky.  The best way to learn about them
is to experiment with them.
