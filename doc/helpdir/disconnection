-----------------------=========+=========----------------------- 

To reduce overhead and prevent abuse the following applies to
disconnection:

  When a player disconnects, the player will remain disconnected
  on the game for up to 1/4 hour, at this point all the player's
  items will be transferred to a box at its present location and 
  the player will be forced to quit. The box will remain for another
  45 minutes, then it, and its contents will be destroyed. Only
  the disconnected player can get into its box.

  If there is more than one box in a room just type 'get all' or 
  'get box #' this will allow you to open your box. Each box is
  marked with a tag containing the owner's name.

  If less than 15 minutes remain until reboot when a player
  disconnects, the player will automatically quit at 100 seconds
  before reboot.  If less than 200 seconds remain until reboot,
  the player will quit just before reboot.  If less than 20
  seconds are left, the player will quit at the time of reboot.
  
  If you are fighting a monster and disconnect, combat will stop.
  However, if you disconnect again while fighting that monster,
  combat will continue, unless more than 15 minutes have passed.
