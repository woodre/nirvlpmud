Usage: brief
      
  Your brief setting controls what you see as you move between
rooms.  The brief command toggles between the three settings.  In
brief mode, you see only the short description of a room.  In
verbose mode, you see the full description.  In detail mode, you
see both.

Note: Default for a new player is verbose mode.
      To set the ansi pref for room titles in detail mode see
      'help ansipref' or the ansipref command.
