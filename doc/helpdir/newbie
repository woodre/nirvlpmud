-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------          

   There are a number of available resources for new players.
 The School of the Apprentices for Levels 1-7 is located south,
 enter hall, north of the church.  There one may learn basic
 concepts of the game and obtain a weapon, armor, and a simple
 map of the town center.  
  
   The newbie channel (help channels for more information)
 provides a way for new players to ask questions and learn
 more about the game.  To use it type 'newbie <stuff here>'.
 For a channel history, type 'newbie history'.

   Level 1-7 players will benefit from the resources and 
 gear found in the Hall of the Apprentices located south,
 enter hall, from the church.  Newer players may buy portable
 healing substances, obtain simple armor and weapons, and
 should spend some time perusing the library.  A careful
 examination of the library will reveal two books containing
 a great deal of information about how to play and where to
 find things.  Those that are not in a guild will also benefit
 from a healing aura.

   We welcome new players at Nirvana.  Many players have been
 here for a very long time and consider this a kind of home.
 We hope new players enjoy Nirvana and stay with us.
