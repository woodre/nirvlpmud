-----------------------------=========+=========-----------------------------

I am officially announcing (again) rewards for players who use the
check_item command to recommend items for update.  These updates will
add additional attributes to items relating to the damage type system
that has been introduced into Nirvana.

What does that mean?  Well, that's a good quesiton, Slacker.  Thanks
for bringing it up.  Here's an example:  Dragons breathe fire, and
they attack you physically.  Right now, your armor protects you
against fire and physical attacks equally.  Once the dragon is updated,
your armor won't protect against its fire any longer, but it'll still
work against the dragon's physical attacks.  But, you'll also have
the opportunity to find gear that protects specifically against fire,
affording you as much or more protection against it.  Some guild
spells are already doing different kinds of damage, and some monsters
and gear have also already been updated.  When enough items have
been updated, the basic mud spells will be changed as well.

So where you come in is this:  use the check_item command on any
monster, weapon, or armor that should have some kind of effect on non-
physical damage.  Dragons should breathe real fire.  Ice demons should
freeze you.  Gear should protect you from fire, ice, or other things,
depending on its description ('look item') and theme (what area did
it come from, and what kind of monster?)

Don't worry too much about the specific types or amounts.  Just point
out the monster/item, and include a comment about what you think it
should do.  We'll make sure it's clear from the monster's emotes what
kind of damage it's doing to you, and you can find out which types
an item effects in Orin's Inn in Ryllian (but not how much- that's up
to you to test out and determine.)

Those players that recommend the most objects and include useful
suggestions will each recieve a unique reward in propotion to their
contribution.  Because they have an unfair advantage, players that
belong to wizards are not eligble for prizes

The contest will continue until enough items have been submitted and
updated, at which point the prizes will be awarded.  The more you guys
explore and submit items, the faster it'll be done and you'll get your
presents.
