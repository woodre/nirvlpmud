Once upon a time, there was a boy who wanted to be king.
He wanted so badly to be king, but he had no talents.
This boy worked for an evil corporation and sold pizzas
in his spare time.

Over time, the boy tried to manipulate people and
play unsuspecting people against each other. This did
not work out as well as he had planned. The boy
was caught by the king and his subjects and he
was held in disgust.

Because the boy realized he could never be king,
he soon fell into despair. What could he do with his
time outside of the massive corporation he worked for?

Suddenly, it struck him. He could steal all the work
the king and his subjects had amassed over the years
and change the name.

In 2003, the boy managed to convince some disloyal
subjects of the king to follow suit. They launched
a rebellion. Which ultimately failed entirely.
They enlisted the help of a fuckwit, a prick,
an egomaniac, an utter failure, and a confused
hippie.

Legends speaks today of a place that still exists
somewhere out there in the nether-regions of the
Internet, where the boy still proclaims himself
to be king and masquerades atop the work he raped
and pillaged from the lands so long ago.
