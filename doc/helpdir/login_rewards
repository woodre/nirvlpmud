                     [Nirvana Login Rewards]
-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

    When a player first logs in, the weekly period will be set.
  They will have 7 days to meet the experience requirement in
  order to gain the login reward. The exp requirement is 50% of
  the exp required to get to the next level at the time your login
  period is set. The exp requirement is capped at a max of 250k.
  
    Your exp gained for the week will be tracked between logins so 
  the exp can be gained at any point during the 7 days. Once the 
  period ends, the login period will be reset. If you met the exp 
  requirement for the week then your login streak continues! If not 
  then your streak will be reset.
  
    Keep in mind that the login rewards is based on real time. So
  if you meet your required exp for the week and then don't login
  for 2 weeks, your streak will still end.
  
    For each week the player has a streak the player will be 
  awarded 5,000 nirvana points. As an example, the first week a
  player will gain 5,000 points. If the player meets the requirement
  for the 2nd consecutive week, they will be awarded 10,000 points!
  
    In addition, each month (every 4 weeks) the payout will be 
  double the normal award. The longer your streak, the more you
  will earn!
