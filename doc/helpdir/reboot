-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

Usage: reboot

  This command reports the current local time, time of last reboot,
and time of the next reboot.

  Reboot is when Nirvana automatically shuts down, then starts up
again.  Armageddon the Game Crasher will arrive before reboot and
announce that it's coming.

  If you stay logged on right up until the moment of a reboot, some
of your items can be automatically saved, and restored to you when
you log in after the reboot.  Use the itemtest command to see
which items will save.

  Currently, Nirvana only has one scheduled reboot every 24 hours,
at 6:05 AM.
