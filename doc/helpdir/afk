Usage: afk <message>
       afk

  Set a message letting others know that you've gone away from
your keyboard.  If you're already afk, simply typing something
will clear your message.

  Your afk status will show to other players in the room, and in
who.  Your afk message will be displayed to anyone who sends you
a tell while you're afk.  The tell will still go through
normally.  You'll remain afk until you turn it off or log out.

WARNING: afk is purely for informational purposes.  It does not
protect you from being killed, or being automatically logged out.
