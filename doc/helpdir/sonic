Usage: sonic <target>
       so <target>

 This command will cast the spell Sonic. When in combat no argument
is necessary, as it will automatically target your opponent. If not
in combat then casting this on a monster will start a fight. Sonic
has a cost of 25 spell points to cast each use and does 12-45 points
of damage. You must be level 19+5 to cast this spell.
