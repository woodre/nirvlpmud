                         [help wizard]
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wizards are the admin staff of the mud. They create the areas and
fix the problems that the mud may have. If you have any problems
with your character, contact a wizard.

Wizards can only help players to a point. They must follow rules
too just like players must. So don't be upset when a wizard tells
you they can't do what you are asking them to do. Wizards try and
keep as much out of player business as possible. And tend to let
the players rule themselves, within their own social structures.

For a list of some wizards and directions to their areas seek out
the traveler in the advance hall and 'ask' him about areas.

Type "help wizard_application" for info on how to become a wizard.
