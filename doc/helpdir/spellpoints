-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------   

  Spellpoints are determined by level and Magical Aptitude. Spell
points are used up by casting game spells, sending tells, or talking
on open chat lines.  Spellpoints regenerate with time and can be
aided with healing items such as potions, food, etc. which can
either increase the rate or give a set amount all at once.
