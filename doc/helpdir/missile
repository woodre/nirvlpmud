Usage: missile <target>
       mi <target>

   This command will cast the spell Missile. When in combat no
argument is necessary, as it will automatically target your
opponent. If not in combat then casting this on a monster will
start a fight. Missile has a cost of 10 spell points to cast
each use and does 1-20 points of damage. You must be level 5
to cast this spell.
