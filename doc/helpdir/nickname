                         [help nickname]
-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

Usage: "nickname <nick> <definition>"
       "nicknames"
       "unnickname <nick>"

       A nickname is similar to an alias [see "help alias"] -- 
however, nicknames are used in association with targets, rather than
commands.  Type "nickname x bobby" and you'll be able to send tells
to Bobby simply by typing "tell x <whatever>".  Use "nickname d dragon"
and slap dragons around simply by typing "slap d"!  The uses are infinite.

       "nicknames" lists all of the nicknames you have, with a maximum
of 50.  Use "unnickname <nick>" to remove a nickname already in use.
