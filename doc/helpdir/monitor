-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

Usage: "mon"
       "mon <on/off>"
       "mon auto"
       "mon ansi"
       "mon default"

When you start a new character, your internal combat monitor is
toggled to ON.  When you fight a creature, you will see some
information like this every two seconds [one heartbeat]:

    <<<<  HP 100/100 SP 100/100 I 0% F 0% S 0% T 0%  AHP 10/10  >>>>

You can turn off your default monitor by typing 'mon off' or turn 
it back on by typing 'mon on'.  You can change the color of your 
monitor to dark red by typing 'mon ansi'.  You can display your
combat monitor to the room by typing 'report'.

Auto will display your monitor whenever your HP or SP change
as well as when in battle. 'mon auto' will act as a toggle between
'mon on' and 'mon auto'.

The letters/numbers represent:

 HP = Current hit points/maximum hit points
 SP = Current spell points/maximum spell points
  I = Intoxication (will rise as you use alcoholic heals)
  F = Fullness or stuff (will rise with certain food heals)
  S = Soaked (will rise with non-alcoholic drinks)
  T = Transferred or infusion (rises when another player heals you)
AHP = Attacker's health based on current hit points/maximum hit points

You can also setup your own combat monitor.  
For more information type 'help setmon'.
