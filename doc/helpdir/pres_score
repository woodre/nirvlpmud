                       [Prestige Score]
-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

    Prestige score will represent your amount of prestige. It 
  will be impacted by three different factors:
    * Prestige Level
    * Prestige Experience
    * Total Quest Points
  
    Total experience will have the largest impact to your
  score. When you prestige your experience is converted to
  prestige experience which represents your total experience.
  Prestige experience will be converted by dividing experience
  by 1000.  

    Each cycle of prestige requires additional work by the 
  player. Gold has to be paid, guild powers given up temporarily.
  This is why prestige level plays the second largest role in
  prestige score. A player with a billion experience who is
  prestige level 1 will have a much lower score than a player
  who is prestige level 10 who has also invested a billion xp.
  
    The last factor is total quest points. When you prestige 
  quests are reset and prestige quest points represent the
  total quest points for the player. Your prestige quest points
  will increase your prestige score.
  
  The score command has been updated to show prestige score. 
  If your guild score command doesn't allow you to view it, 
  use the psc command instead.
