Usage: password <old password>

  This command will change your password. The old password must
 be given correctly as an argument for this to work.  

  It is best to use a password that is hard for others to guess.  
 Do not use the name of your character or your name.  Use some
 combination of letters and numbers and be careful about where
 you write it down.

 Do not use the same password on multiple muds. Your password may
 be compromised elsewhere and allow unauthorized use of
 your character here. As always, there are no restores for player
 file break ins.


If you forget your password mail boltar the following information:

1) Name of character to be restored.
2) Aproximate date of last login. (important if file has been archived)
3) Email address on the player.
4) Various aliases and other information stored on the character.
