-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------   

How to report a problem:

1) Try to figure it out yourself ;) This may sound obvious, but 
it is rutine to help a player and find they looked over something 
obvious such as poorly chosen alias.

2) Use the creator command to determine who made the object. 
If that wizard is online, contact him. If not, and it requires
immediate assistance ask for help from whatever wizard may be 
available. If it does not require immediate assistance mail 
that wizard from the village post office.

3) If that wizard is inactive, hasn't logged on in ages, etc 
as shown by the finger command, please mail Boltar, Sandman, or
Pain and the message will be routed as needed to get the problem
fixed.
