Usage: kill_players

   By using this command you agree that you wish to participate in 
  player killing, and therefore can attack or be attacked by anyone
  else that has their player killing flag set too.  You must be at
  least 3rd level to set your player kill flag. When you die your
  flag is removed and you can no longer be attacked unless you enter
  a pk area or reset your kill_players flag.
