-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

Usage: "alias <alias> <definition>"
       "aliases"
       "unalias <alias>"

       These are used to alias commands to shorter, easy-to-remember
names.  Essentially, aliases allow one to type X to do Y.
For example, if a player types "alias fb use heal",
whenever that player types "fb", he will use his heal.  Obviously,
this is only one use of many.

       "aliases" lists all of the aliases the player has, with a maximum
of 50.  Use "unalias <alias>" to remove an alias already in use.
