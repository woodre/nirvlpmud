Starting out in LP-mud:

OK, basically what you want to do is get experience and gold coins. 
You do this by solving puzzles, killing monsters, and selling 
(after finding) treasures.

You can move around with normal "e,w,n,s,u,d" types of commands.
There are also longer commands, like "get shield", "wear shield",
"wield axe", and commands that are for specific places or objects
like "push button", "open safe", "eat cake" and so on.

Killing monsters is a lot easier with a weapon and some armor (and
realize that you must wield and wear those, respectively).  If the
monster doesn't attack you first, you can type something like 
"kill orc" and you'll start fighting.

If you get killed, you lose a quarter of your experience, and must
go to the church and 'pray' to return to solid form.  Try not to 
have this happen.  Type "help wimpy" to get an idea on how to avoid
this, and "help death" for details. Also, "score" will tell you how
you're doing as far as health, intoxication, etc.

type "help" for a basic list of commands.  Have fun!
