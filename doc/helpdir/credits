The program was written originally by

Lars Pensj|, April 1990 (lars@myab.se)
 
Nirvana uses a modified version of Lars' 2.44 mudlib with bits
and pieces of lp2.45, 1.4.1-A, and a few others.
Of course the mudlib has been modified extensively over the years
the mud has been in operation. 
 
Nirvana Mud was established in Feb 26, 1991, and is not in any way
affiliated or condone the activities of Elysium lpmud. Furthermore the
management does not condone intellectual property theft or software
piracy.
