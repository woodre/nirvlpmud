                          [help follow]
-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------    

Usage: "follow <name>"
       "follow stop"
       "fstatus"

    When a player wishes to follow someone, they use 'follow <name>' 
    where <name> is a player they wish to follow.  Both players must
    be in the same room.

    The named player is asked to allow the follow. To allow the follow
    the named player must only type 'y' at the prompt.  To disallow
    the follow the named player types 'n'.

    'follow stop' completely clears all follows.  It stops the player 
    from following any current leader, and also clears any followers.

Notes:
     Up to 12 players can follow one leader. 
     'fstatus' shows your follow status.
