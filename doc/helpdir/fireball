Usage: fireball <target>
       fi <target>

   This command will cast the spell Fireball. When in combat no
argument is necessary, as it will automatically target your
opponent. If not in combat then casting this on a monster will
start a fight.  Fireball has a cost of 20 spell points to cast
each use and does 1-40 points of damage. You must be level 15
to cast this spell.
