Usage: keep <item>
       keep eq
       keep all

  The keep command allows you to flag an item or items as something
that you want to hang onto.  You won't be able to drop, give away,
or sell an item that you've chosen to keep.  You can keep any item
except an auto-load.

  The 'eq' argument will cause you to keep anything you're wielding
or wearing.  The 'all' argument will keep everything keepable in
your inventory.

  Some things can still cause you to loose a kept item: dying,
quitting, using up all the charges of a heal, or something special
happening with a monster.  Some shops using older code may also
be able to buy kept items, so be careful when selling items in
shops besides the main village shop.
