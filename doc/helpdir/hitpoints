  Hitpoints are determined by level and stamina. Each time you are hit
the damage done will be subtracted from your total hitpoints. When you
reach 0 you will die. Your hitpoints regenerate with time, although
slowly. This can be aided by use of potions/drinks/food/heals, which 
will either speed up the process or restore a set amount of hitpoints.
When you are drunk you will heal faster.
