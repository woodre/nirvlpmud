  Piety         These five attributes are used for a variety of
  Intelligence  things throughout the game. They are mostly used
  Will Power    for guilds and checks to stay out of harms way.
  Dexterity     It may be more useful to leave raising these
  Charisma      until later.

Newbies are allowed to raise attributes 30 times for free, to a
maximum of 10.  Use these free attributes to customize your
character.

After spending your 30 free points, you are allowed to raise only
7 attributes per level if the attrib is going to be raised beyond
15, and each attrib can be no higher than 10 ranks above your current
level.

Extended attribute values are an addition to the game intended
for high level players. They are supposed to be expensive. However,
once one goes above 20, should he lose a stat point, he may regain
it at the cost for the 20th point. For instance if a player dies
and goes from a stealth of 30 to 29 it will cost only 8000 exp 
to raise it back to 30.

Special note about mag and sta above 20. Each point above 20 gains 2
sp or 2 hp. The extended attrib values are aimed for higher level 
characters. Lower level characters still benefit from 8 hp or 8 sp 
for each attrib point 1-20.
