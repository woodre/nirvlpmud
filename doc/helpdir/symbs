 The symbiotes are based on the marvel character Venom.  Venom 
is a symbiotic lifeform that lives in the spine of its host. When
called on, it sprouts from the persons back and surrounds them in
a black smooth coating that acts as body armor and weapon.  When 
appropriate the symbiote can shape itself into a great number of
offensive weapons as well as defensive.  Claws, huge teeth, and 
great strength are the common offensive abilities of this creature.  
As well, the symbiote is capable of creating a web-like substance 
in which it can eject from its hands. This webbing is created from
excess material that the symbiote has stored.  The symbiote and the
host are one and the same.
