-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

Once a player has (1) achieved enough quest points and achieved
level 19+16, OR (2) has achieved level 19+100, the player may then
apply for wizardhood.

The player must find 3 senior wizards willing to approve him. One
of these must agree to "sponsor" him and take responsibility
for him as a newbie wizard.
