Usage: "setmon"
       "setmon <newmon>"

To set your customizable combat monitor, type 'setmon <newmon>'
where <newmon> is the text block of associated values [HP, SP, Intox, etc]
and colors that are translated into your combat monitor.  This text block
will save with your character, so you need only enter it once.
If you wish to view your current monitor text block, type 'setmon'
by itself, and it will display the block to you.

For information on toggling your combat monitor, type 'help monitor'.

EXAMPLE

   A player named Bing's default combat monitor looks like this:

   <<<<  HP 150/200 SP 150/200 I 0% F 0% S 0% T 0% AHP 10/10  >>>>

   Bing just wants to display his current hit points and his enemy's
   hit points, and he wants to colour it a bit, so he types:

   setmon BING: $HR$#hps#$N$  ENEMY: $HB$#ahp#$N$

   And the combat monitor will display:

        BING: [1m[31m150[2;37;0m  ENEMY: [1m[34mAHP: 10/10[2;37;0m

You can also switch back to the MUD's default combat monitor
by typing 'mon default'.  This will purge your existing monitor
text block, however.

For information on values you can use [HP, SP, etc.], type 'help monvalues'.
For info on how to add color to your monitor, type 'help moncolor'.
