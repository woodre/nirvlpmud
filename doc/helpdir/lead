-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------    

Usage: "lead <who>"
       "lead stop"
       "lead stop <who>"

    When a player wishes to have someone follow them, 
    they use 'lead <who>' where <who> is a player they wish to lead
    around the MUD.  Both players must be in the same room.

    The named player is asked to follow. To allow the follow,
    the named player must only type 'y' at the prompt.  To disallow
    the lead the named player types 'n'.

    'lead stop' clears all current followers the player
    may have picked up.

    'lead stop <who>' stops a specific player from following
    the leader, where <who> is the player they wish to stop following.

Notes:
     'fstatus' shows all current followers.
