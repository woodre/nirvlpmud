                       [Help Guilds]

------------------*===================*------------------------
 
     A guild is an association of individuals (sometimes of
various races or creeds) who have banded together to foster
their self interest.  Upon joining a guild, you agree to obey
and abide by the laws, limitations, and enhanced abilities
set by that guild.  
     As each guild is unique in its requirements, you should
investigate each guild carefully before you decide which guild
suits the personality of your character.  Some questions you
might ask of those already in a guild might be how the guild 
leadership is structured, or how the guild will benefit you
in your advancement in the realm of Nirvana.  You might wish
to know how the guild feels about Pk, or perhaps what 'special'
abilities you might one day gain by advancing in that particular
guild.  You should also be prepared to explain what you will
bring to the guild as a member.
     Once joined, most guilds require a severe experience
penalty for leaving, so make your decision with care and
consideration.  The following is a list of current guilds
available in the realm of Nirvana, and the Wizard[s] responsible
for its maintenance.

     Consider that each guild will have both advantages and 
disadvantages.  Most guilds are intentionaly designed with
some drawbacks which balance the special abilities, spells,
or attributes granted to the members.  Ask lots of questions.
Be respectful of a guild's members... and keep guild information
confidential.  Once you join a guild, try to role-play your
character to fit the theme of the guild you selected.

[Notes: If you see "[Beta]" next to the name of any guild,
       that means the guild is currently in Testing, and
       isn't currently open to the public.  An *
       next to the name indicates a guild wizard
       who is currently inactive or doing other things, 
       so mails may go unresponded to.
       Original creators are not always credited in
       this help file, especially if they have not
       taken part in the guild for years.
