   ANIMATION:  "The Tale Of Sir Galahad"


14 EXTERIOR - STORM - FOREST - DUSK

   As the storm rages we pick up GALAHAD forcing his way through brambles and
   over slippery rocks.  Progress is hard.  He pauses and at this moment
   we hear the howling of wolves.  GALAHAD turns, then hurries onward even
   more urgently.  Another louder, closer howl is herd and GALAHAD stumbles
   and falls heavily.  Though obviously injured he bravely struggles
   forward a little and regains his feed reacting with pain.  More louder
   closer howling.  He grips his sword valiantly and as he glances around
   a flash of lightning reveals the silhouette of a huge terrifying castle,
   perhaps looking rather derelict.  He makes up his mind in an instant and
   stumbles manfully toward it.  More louder howling.  He reaches the
   forbidding and enormous doors of the castle and beats on the doors with the
   handle of his sword, looking over his shoulder the while.  Pause.
   He beats again, shouting:

                               GALAHAD
       Open.  Open the doors.  In the name of King Arthur.  Open the doors.
|      I am Sir Galahad, a knight of the Round Table.
|
|  Some suitable noises are herd inside.
|
|      I am on a quest for the Holy Grail.  I seek shelter.

   Some rattling chainy noises come from inside with huge bolts being
   drawn.  The wolves' howling is very close.  As the door creaks
   open GALAHAD steps quickly inside.

15 INTERIOR - CASTLE - NIGHT

   From inside we see GALAHAD enter, wiping the rain from his eyes, and turn
   as the door crashes behind him.  GALAHAD turns to the door reacting to the
   fact he is trapped.

                               ZOOT (OUT OF VISION)
       Hello!

   GALAHAD turns back.  We see from his POV the lovely ZOOT standing by him
   smiling enchantingly and a number of equally delectable GIRLIES draped
   around in the seductively poulticed room.  They look at him smilingly and
   wave.

                               GIRLIES
       Hello!

                               ZOOT
       Welcome, gentle Sir knight, welcome to the Castle Anthrax.

                               GALAHAD
       The Castle Anthrax?

                               ZOOT
       Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are
       nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!

                               GALAHAD
       Er ...
+      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?

                               ZOOT
       The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget!
       Crapper!

                               MIDGET AND CRAPPER
       Yes, O Zoot?

                               ZOOT
       Prepare a bed for our guest.

                               MIDGET AND CRAPPER
           (grovelling with delight)
       Oh thank you, Zoot, thank you, thank you.

                               ZOOT
       Away varletesses!
           (to GALAHAD)
       The beds here are warm and soft and very, very big.

                               GALAHAD
       Well, look er, I ...

                               ZOOT
       What is your name, handsome knight?

                               GALAHAD
       Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.

                               ZOOT
       Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot
           (she is very close to him for a moment)
       But come.

   She turns away and leads him towards a door leading to a corner leading
   to the bedchamber

                               GALAHAD
       Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...

                               ZOOT
       Sir Galahad!!

   There is a gasp from the other GIRLS

                               ZOOT
       You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.

   GALAHAD looks at the other GIRLS.  They are clearly on the verge of
   being offended.

                               GALAHAD
       Well ...

                               ZOOT
           (she moves off and GALAHAD unwillingly follows)
       I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared
       to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between
       sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no
       one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ...
       dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....

   They reach the end of the corridor and enter the bedchamber.
   ZOOT turns

                               ZOOT
       We are just not used to handsome knights ...
           (she notices him limping)
       But you are wounded!

                               GALAHAD
       No, It's nothing!

                               ZOOT
       You must see the doctors immediately.
            (she claps again)
       You must lie down.

   She almost forces him to lie on the bed as PIGLET and WINSTON enter the
   room.  They are equally beautiful and dressed exotically.  They
   approach GALAHAD.

                               PIGLET
       Well,  what seems to be the trouble?

                               GALAHAD
       They're doctors?

                               ZOOT
       They have a basic medical training, yes.  Now you must try to rest.
       Dr. Winston! Dr. Piglet!  Practice your art!!

                               WINSTON
       Try to relax.

                               GALAHAD
       No look, really, this isn't nescess ...

                               PIGLET
       We must examine you.

                               GALAHAD
       There's nothing wrong with ... that.

                               PIGLET
           (slightly irritated)
       Please ... we are doctors.

   ZOOT reappears.  GALAHAD tries for one brief moment to relax.  Then there is
   a sharp boing from the lower part of his armour.  WINSTON glances quickly
   in the appropriate direction as GALAHAD sits up and starts getting off the
   bed and collecting his armour, saying:

                               GALAHAD
       No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!

                               PIGLET
       Back to your bed!  At once!

                               GALAHAD
       I'm sorry, I must go.

   GALAHAD hurries to the door and pushes through it.  As he leaves the room
   we CUT TO the reverse to show that he is now in a room full of bathing
   and romping GIRLIES, all innocent, wide-eyed and beautiful.  They smile
   enchantingly at him as he tries to keep walking without being diverted by
   the lovely sights assaulting his eyeballs.  He nods to them stiffly once
   or twice and then his eye catches a particularly stunning YOUNG LADY.
   He visibly gulps with repressed emotion and cannot resist saying:
|
|                              GALAHAD
|      Good evening ... Ah, Zoot!  Er ...
|
|                              DINGO
|      No, I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.
|
|                              GALAHAD
|      Oh.  Well, I'm sorry, but I must leave immediately.
|
|                              DINGO
|          (very dramatically)
|      No!  Oh, no!  Bad ... bad Zoot.
|
|                              GALAHAD
|      Er, why?
|
|                              DINGO
|      She has been lying again ... she told us you had promised to
|      stay for ever!
|
|                              GALAHAD
|      Oh!
+
+                              GALAHAD
+      Oh ... will you excuse me?
+
+                              DINGO
+      Where are you going?
+
+                              GALAHAD
+      I have seen the Grail! I have seen it - here in this castle!
+
+                              DINGO
+      No!  Oh, no!  Bad ... bad Zoot!
+
+                              GALAHAD
+      What is it?
+
+                              DINGO
+      Bad, wicked, naughty Zoot!  She has been setting fire to our beacon,
+      which - I have just remembered - is grail-shaped ...  It is not the
+      first time we've had this problem.
+
+                              GALAHAD
+      It's not the real Grail?
+
+                              DINGO
       Wicked wicked Zoot ... she is a bad person and she must pay the
       penalty.  And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment
       ... you must tie her down on a bed ... and spank her.  Come!

                               GIRLS
       A spanking!  A spanking!

                               DINGO
       You must spank her well and after you have spanked her you
       may deal with her as you like and then ... spank me.

                               AMAZING
       And spank me!

                               STUNNER
       And me.

                               LOVELY
       And me.

                               DINGO
       Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!

                               GIRLS
       A spanking.  A spanking.  There is going to be a spanking tonight.

                               DINGO
       And after the spanking ... the oral sex.

                               GALAHAD
       Oh, dear! Well, I...

                               GIRLS
       The oral sex ...  The oral sex.

                               GALAHAD
       Well, I suppose I could stay a BIT longer.

   At this moment there is a commotion behind and SIR LAUNCELOT and CONCORD,
   possibly plus GAWAIN, burst into the bathing area with swords drawn and
   form themselves round SIR GALAHAD threatening the GIRLS.

                               LAUNCELOT
       Sir Galahad!

                               GALAHAD
       Oh ... hello ...

                               LAUNCELOT
       Quick!

                               GALAHAD
       Why?

                               LAUNCELOT
       You are in great peril.

                               DINGO
       No he isn't

                               LAUNCELOT
       Silence! Foul temptress!

                               GALAHAD
       Well, she's got a point.

                               LAUNCELOT
       We'll cover your escape!

                               GALAHAD
       Look - I'm fine!

                               GIRLS
       Sir Galahad!

   He threatens DINGO.

                               GALAHAD
       No. Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!

                               GIRLS
       Yes, yes, let him Tackle us single-handed!

                               LAUNCELOT
       Come Sir Galahad, quickly!

                               GALAHAD
       No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!

                               DINGO
       Yes, let him handle us easily.

                               LAUNCELOT
       No sir.  Quick!


   He starts pulling GALAHAD away.

                               GALAHAD
       No, please.  Please! I can defeat them!  There's only a hundred.

                               GIRLS
       He will beat us easily.  We haven't a chance.

                               DINGO
       Oh shit!

   By now LAUNCELOT and CONCORDE have hustled GALAHAD out of the bathing
   area and are running through the outside door.

                               LAUNCELOT
       We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.

                               GALAHAD
           (dragging his feet somewhat)
       I don't think I was.

                               LAUNCELOT
       You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.

                               GALAHAD
       Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?

                               LAUNCELOT
       It's too perilous.

   They are right outside the castle by now.

                               GALAHAD
       Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.

                               LAUNCELOT
       No, no, we must find the Grail.

  The thunderstorm is over.  A bunch (sic) of PAGES are tethered to a tree with
  more MEN waiting.  Their tethers are untied and the PAGES start banging away
  with their coconuts.  GALAHAD is swept along with them as they ride off.

                               GALAHAD
       Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?

                               LAUNCELOT
       No.  It's unhealthy.

                               GALAHAD
       ... I Bet you're gay.

                               LAUNCELOT
       No, I'm not.

   GAWAIN or CONCORDE gives a knowing glance at LAUNCELOT.  VOICE comes in as
   they ride off.
