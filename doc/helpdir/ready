Usage: ready

  This command will cause your character to automatically wield 
 weapons and wear armor that is in their inventory. Items 
 wielded/worn are the last on the list. For instance, if you have
 2 suits of armor, the second suit will be worn. This command will
 not choose the best armor and weapon for you.
