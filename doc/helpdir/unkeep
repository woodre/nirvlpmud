Usage: unkeep <item>
       unkeep eq
       unkeep all

  Unkeeping an item removes the keep flag, allowing you to drop,
sell, or give it away again, assuming it's an item you can normally
do those things to.  The 'eq' argument will apply the unkeep
command to anything you're wearing or wielding, and the 'all'
argument will make sure nothing in your inventory is kept.
