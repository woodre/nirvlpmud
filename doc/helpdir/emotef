-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------                                   

Usage: emotef <who> <action>

   This works much like a tell command, only it sends an emotion
to someone anywhere on the mud. The action is placed after the
players name much like a normal emote. 
This action supports tellblock and tellhistory.
