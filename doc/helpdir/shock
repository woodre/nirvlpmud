Usage: shock <target>
       sh <target>

   This command will cast the spell Shock. When in combat no argument
is necessary, as it will automatically target your opponent. If not
in combat then casting this on a monster will start a fight. Shock
has a cost of 15 spell points to cast each use and does 1-30 points
of damage. You must be level 10 to cast this spell.
