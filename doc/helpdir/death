-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------
   
Death occurs when you go below 0 hit points.  When you die you 
leave your body and become a ghost.  You must then go to the
village church and type, 'pray' to return to a solid form.  Death
also triggers the creation of a tunnel of light, leading to the
village green.  Ghosts can enter this tunnel, allowing them to 
reach the church quicker.

Your possessions will remain on your corpse until you or another
player pick them up.  However, your new body after praying will
not be quite identical to the one you got killed.  You will lose
experience, which may cause you to drop to a lower level, and you
will lose one random attribute point.

How much experience you lose depends on your level.  If you are
level 7 or lower, you lose 1/6 of your total experience.  If 
you're level 8 or higher, you lose 1/4 of your experience.  No
matter your level, you can't lose more than two levels by dying,
even if that means you lose less experience.

Joining some guilds of Nirvana may cause different things to
happen to you when you die.
