                            [Prestige]
-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

    Prestige levels are an optional set of levels that can be
  obtained after maxing out a character at level 19+100. When a
  player chooses to prestige, their character is reset back to 
  level 1 like a new character. They can then level up again
  just like a new character would. This process can be repeated
  as long as the player wishes. There is no limit to the number
  of prestige levels a player may gain.

    The dedication of doing prestige will be rewarded with
  a prestige skill point. This skill point can be put toward
  one of the prestige bonus skills. These skills will enhance
  the player's abilities. The more prestige levels a player
  obtains the stronger their prestige skills will become.
