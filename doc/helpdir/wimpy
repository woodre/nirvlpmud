-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------   

Usage: wimpy
       wimpy <% of hitpoints> <direction>
       wimpy off

  This command will allow your character to flee when their 
 hitpoints reach the % amount set. You will flee in the 
 <direction> given. The command wimpy without an argument
 will show what your wimpy is set to. Typing, 'wimpy off'
 will turn off your wimpy and put you in brave mode. Using,
 'random' for the direction will send you in a random
 direction. This direction may or may not be an exit. Attempts 
 will be made until you exit the room. 

 For player-killing players, the rules for wimpy are a little
 skewed. There is a chance of failure, so you might
 not be able to run away fast enough! You won't know
 that it fails, it will just fail.
