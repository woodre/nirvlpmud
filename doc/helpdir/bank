-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

  In Nirvana's main village is a bank (s,4e,n,e,n from the church)
where you can store your extra coins.  You can only withdraw coins
if you return to the bank during the same reboot that you deposited
them.  After reboot, you can no longer withdraw the coins, but they
are saved, and you'll be able to use them for forthcoming additions
to Nirvana, such as buying and decorating your own house in your
favorite area.
