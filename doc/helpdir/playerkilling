-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

Player killing, or PK for short, is an optional form of combat that
involves player versus player.  It may happen in one of two ways:

First, a player has the option of setting PK by using 'kill_players'.
By doing so, a player may fight another player that has this option
set, in almost any room that combat may take place.  

The second way, is to enter a PK area - which you will be notified of
when you do so with a message.  PK may take place in these areas at
any time, as long as combat may take place in that room.

If you set your PK and die to another player, you will lose experience.
All of your gear and money will go into your corpse where your killer
can take it or leave it as they please.  What, if anything, is returned
to you is completely up to the player who killed you.

NOTE:
Level restrictions have been added to pk. If a player is below level 8
he is restricted to attacking and being attacked by players +/- 3 levels
from him. This is intended to prevent newbies from being hunted while
still allowing them to participate in PK with their peers.
