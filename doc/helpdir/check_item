Usage: check_item <target>

   Use this command to report a monster or item that you think
   might be in need of an update with different damage types.
   If you report something that has already been updated or
   reported, you'll be notified.  Otherwise a record will be
   left, and a wizard will look at the item as soon as possible.
   
   Any item that by its description or theme should have some
   effect on non-physical damage is eligible to be reported.
