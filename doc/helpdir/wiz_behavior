WIZARD BEHAVIOR CODE.
 
1)  No wizard is to help or hinder players in any form. This 
    includes desting, zapping, good weapons, free experience,
    desting a monster in combat, healing a monster in combat,
    etc. Any complaints about a wizard should be mailed to me,
    Boltar. 
 
2)  What we do with annoying players. Players who come on the
    mud for the sole purpose of filling the channels full of
    garabage etc, or those who spam or are harrassing other
    players are to be placed in /room/prison by any wizard 
    on. cases involving established players (not newbies) should
    have the account mailed to boltar by the responding wiz.

2.1)Annoying wizards. wizards who abuse the channels, entrance
    messages echo alls, etc should be reported to Boltar, details
    are important. I will deal with it from there. Note: random
    movie quotes from star wars, holy grail, etc are allowed :)

3)  Wizard to Wizard. I will not tolerate any bickering. I am
    sick of it. Demotions must be thoroughly explained to me,
    Boltar. I will make all final decisions as to level. 
 
4)  Illegal objects. The rules are clearly spelled out in
    /doc/build. If a wizard fails to code by these rules that
    wizard will be subject to demotion. complaints from players
    on fixed illegal objects will not be entertained and may
    result in a very nasty reply. Reports of illegal objects
    from anyone will be investigated. 
 
5)  Consquences, First, I have been too nice in the past. I will
    decide what are major or minor offenses on a case to case
    basis. Major offenses will range from loss of many levels
    to loss of wizardship. Minor will be a small demotion or a 
    warning. after a warning has been given the next minor 
    offense will be considered major. Multiple troubles will
    result in banishment.
