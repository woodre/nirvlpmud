                        [Prestige Guilds]
-----------------------=========+=========-----------------------

    Guilds are a key source of power on Nirvana. Guilds also
  often require a large amount of time and experience to be
  invested by the player in order to obtain those powers.
  
    When you choose to prestige, your character will be reset
  to level 1. It would be absurd for a level 1 player to have
  max guild abilities. It also would be difficult for a player
  to lose the sacrifices invested into their chosen guild. In
  order to find a balance, advancing prestige level will 
  work in the following manner:
  
    * All guild information will be saved.
    * Your guild object will be destroyed, however your guild
      stats will remain saved.
    * After meeting minimum requirements, you may restore your
      guild. This will restore your guild stats exactly as they
      were before your prestiged.
    * A player may join any guild after a prestige, or restore
      any guilds saved from previous prestige levels.
