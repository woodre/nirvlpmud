SYNOPSIS
	mixed *sort_array(mixed *arr, string greater_fun, object|string ob)
	mixed *sort_array(mixed *arr, closure cl)

DESCRIPTION
	Returns an array sorted by the ordering function
	ob->greater_fun(a, b), resp by the closure expression.
	If 0 is given as first argument, 0 is returned.

	The function 'greater_fun' in the object 'ob' (which may be
	also given as its file_name) is continously passed two
	arguments which are two of the elements of the array 'arr'. It
	should return true or a positive number if the first argument
	is greater than the second.

EXAMPLES
	To sort an array in ascending order:

	int *a;
	a = ({ ..... });
	sort_array(a, #'>)

	transpose_array(E), filter_array(E), map_array(E), alists(LPC)
