SYNOPSIS
	string read_bytes(string file, int start, int len)

DESCRIPTION
	Reads len bytes bytes from file, beginning with byte start.
	If start is a negative value it will be counted	from the end
	of the file. The start and len parameters are optional, they
	default to 0 (not really useful, though).
