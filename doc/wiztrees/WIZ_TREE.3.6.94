 Assistant(s)
     80           NOTE:  New groups will be added as needed.  The current
      |           group leaders will all nominate wizards they think can
 12 Wizs MAX      or want the job, then leaders will be selected by the gods.
   21-70          If you think your name should be up here, mail a letter to
                  me telling me why.  We'll review all applicants.

WIZPOOL
     All wizards of level 20.  Where they wait to be chosen by a group leader.
If they are not chosen by anyone.  They must wait for a week minimum to pass
where they will then be put into a random group by one of the gods.



DESCRIPTION OF EACH POSITION AND DUTIES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* IMPLEMENTER:  Focuses on general quality and efficiency of mud code.  Updates
the mud driver as needed, keeps the mud running, and owns it all!
* MORTAL PROBLEMS:  Handles problems with players (e.g. wedding rings).
* GUILD BALANCE:  Keeps the guilds balanced in terms of game play.  Decides
which guilds are allowed and what they can do.
* LAW:  What's legal and what's not.  Rules & Regs, finance, bookkeeping (yuk!)
* SECURITY:  Checks on cheaters both players and wizards and has the power to
demote on the spot.  Especially unruly players or wizards may be banished by a
god at the recommendation of the Security Chief.  Coding experience not needed.
* GROUP LEADERS/SPONSORS: Train new wizards, approve castles, promote/demote
wizards within their group, can serve as assistants to gods as needed to help
out in special projects or functions (e.g. castle relocation, internal audit
of all castles, etc.)  Any wizard that fails to meet the expectations of the
group leader can be dismissed and put back into the WIZPOOL, especially unruly
wizards may be banished by a god at the recommendation of the group leader.
* GROUP ASSISTANTS:  Must be available to train the other members of the group
on the finer points of mud coding.  Has authority over group when group leader
is not present.  Assists group leader with other group functions.  Position is
limited because you can't directly edit other wizard's files.
* WIZPOOL:  All new wizards, allowed to peruse the docs and trans randomly
around at leisure, if caught helping another player will be immediately banished
and forgotten.  Should write a letter to the groups they want to join and ask
for sponsorship.
      


PROMOTION GUIDELINES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.   For now use the following levels of promotion:
* 21 - New group wizard, try and find a personal mentor within the group for
this guy!  We don't want bad habits forming.
* 30 - Wizard who shows promise and wants the privacy of 'invis' for coding.
* 40 - Trusted wizard with a fair knowledge of LPC so that they can assist other
wizards with coding, or for trusted wizards who you want to allow to peruse the
group's files. 
* 50,60,70 - as desired.  We may group all these level's powers together.
I'm not quite sure what duties to put on these levels.
* 80 - Assistant Group Wizard, someone you trust enough to represent you when
you're not around or to help you out with group admin.  Still deciding on how
many of these to allow (maybe 1 or 2).  This person will most likely be the
next candidate for group leadership if a new group is formed or if a group
leadership position becomes vacant.  This is the highest level within a group.
* 90 - Reserved for security assistants so they can 'snoop' the majority.
Who watches the watchmen?  The gods will, but the buck stops here.  =)

2.   Promotions above 30 in increments of 1 are not allowed, as it only leads
to pettiness since there's no real gain.  We may have a use for increments of 1
at a later date.  


NOTES AND UNRESOLVED ISSUES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.   In order to minimize code changes, the level numbers and corresponding
numbers will not be changed.  However, incremental promotions (i.e. level 61,
31) will no longer be allowed.  All wizards below 100 with such a level will
be moved to the lowest level which will still enable them to retain their
current 'powers'.
2.   How to handle the allotment of guilds.  One idea was to allow only group
leaders to run a guild.  This may or may not apply to current guild wizards.
3.   The idea of realms was tossed about, where each group leader would design
a realm in which to put their groups castles within.  This could be applied as
an extension of the current mud backbone or be like placing the group's castles
within the castle of the group leader.
4.   Should we change the way wizards are sponsored (i.e. Leo and the 
portable castle) since it requires both the sponsor and newbie wiz to be on at
the same time, or modify it.
    This will not be changed -Bp
5.   Need to modify the file access so that wizards of level 40-100 can only
see/edit files within their own group. 
       Can give ability for assisants to edit files of others in group
   otherwise I want file access to remain the same. -Bp
6.   Should we modify the way certain powers are allocated amongst the wiz
levels (e.g. move 'localcmd' to level 20, combine level 21-30 for invis).
    level 21 should not have invis. they can get by with the player invisiblity
spell if they wish to hide from players -Bp
7.   Possible voting board, made up of the group leaders and gods to decide
on rule changes or standards.  Would be another priviledge of being a group
leader.
