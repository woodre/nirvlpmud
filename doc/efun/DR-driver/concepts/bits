	Bits, why I hate them

DESCRIPTION
	There are 3 efuns for handling bits:

		string set_bit( string, int)
		string clear_bit( string, int)
		int test_bit( string, int)

	But clear_bit is not working like it should. I am guessing, but it
	seems that clear_bit takes two arguments of type string, and handles
	the second string like a number. Bleah..
