CONCEPT
	Attributes, only in 3.01.02-DR?
	Implemented by Raistlin. Amylaar style doc by Balowski.

DESCRIPTION
	In every object there is a list of attributes.
	Attributes are identified by a string, and has a value (int) and a
        protection state (int).

	I don't quite know what the initial purpose of these attributes was.
	They seem to be good for adding special attributes to weapons for
	instance, but they are lost when the object is dest'ed, and they are
	not saved with save_object().
	I think I will put magic resistance into armour this way.. perhaps.
