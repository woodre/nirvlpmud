CONCEPT
	Mappings. Not really anything more than a list of DR-efuns.

DESCRIPTION
	Not used a lot, and they are explained okay in the lpcmanuals in /doc.
	But the efuns for mappings are a bit different here in Nirvana. The
	efuns are listed below.
	Searching for elements in mappings has been said to be faster than in
	arrays. You can add to mappings, just like arrays. A _new_ mapping is
	the result. Dunno howto expand a mapping in a way similar to the way
	deletem shrinks a mapping (would be useful when daemonizing stuff).

EFUNS
	mapping allocate_mapping( int)
		allocates a mapping the size of argument

	mixed deletem( mapping, mixed)
		deletes an entry in the mapping

	mixed *keys( mapping)
		returns an array of the indices to the mapping

	int sizeof( mapping)
		returns the size of the mapping

	int mapp( mixed)
		returns 1 if argument is a mapping, 0 if not

	filter_array() should work too, but I have yet to check it out
