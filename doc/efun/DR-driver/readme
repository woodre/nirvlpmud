BLURB
	Docs compiled and mostly written by Balowski.
	Some places snippets of Amylaar driver docs have been pinched.
	Where a part of the Amylaar driver docs has been copied, I have
	put a [A]. Credit where it is due.
	Doc style has definitely been copied from Amylaar docs.
	In the SEE ALSO section one can find the symbols:
	(E)	efun
	(C)	concepts
	(LPC)	lpc :^)

	The symbols tells in which directory to to find more information.

	These man pages were collected from the original 2.4.5 docs,
	from the installed docs of NightFall, TubMud and MorgenGrauen.

	They were collected corrected and completed Pepel@NightFall,
	with assistance and support by the LPC wizards of NightFall,
	TubMud and MorgenGrauen, namely Hyp, Macbeth and Mateese. Also
	to mention are Bumblebee, Boing, Deepthought, Demos, Hate and
	Jof.

	A bunch of bug fixes for the docs was received from
	Symmetry@Tmi-2
