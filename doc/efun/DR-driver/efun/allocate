SYNOPSIS
	mixed *allocate( int size)

DESCRIPTION [A]
	Allocate an array of size elements. The number of elements
	must be >= 0 and not bigger than a system maximum (usually
	1000).

	Note that this function is hardly needed anymore, because
	arrays can be added by the + operator, and can be constructed
	and initialized by the ({ }) operator. The function's only
	use is to construct big empty arrays.

EXAMPLE
	string *buffer;
	buffer = allocate(50);

SEE ALSO
	arrays(C), sizeof(E), reallocate(E), pointerp(E)
