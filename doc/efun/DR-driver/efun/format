SYNOPSIS
	string format( string text)
	string format( string text, int linewidth)

DESCRIPTION
	Formats the given string 'text'.
	This function inserts '\n' in the string, so that the formatted
	string will at least have one '\n' for every linewidth characters.
	Words are _not_ chopped into pieces, '\n' is inserted only when
	a ' ' is encountered. No hyphenation, of course.
	If linewidth is not specified, TEXT_WIDTH is used.
	TEXT_WIDTH cannot be changed, and is probably set to 70.

EXAMPLE
	format( "An example of how nice format() is. Note that it handles\
	newline\nvery well.\n", 40);
	/* result:
	"An example of how nice format() is.\n\
	Note that it handles newline\n\
	very well.\n"
	*/

SEE ALSO
	print(E), pad(E)
