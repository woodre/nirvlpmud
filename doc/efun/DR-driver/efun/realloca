SYNOPSIS
	mixed *reallocate( mixed *arr, int count)

DESCRIPTION
	Make a new array from an old one.
	Allocates an new array of the size 'count'. Then copies as
	much as possible of the old array 'arr' into the new.
	If 'count > sizeof( arr)' then all of 'arr' will be copied
	into the new array. Remaining indexes set to 0.
	Otherwise the first 'count' indexes of 'arr' are copied into
	the new array.
	Probably not the most used function.

EXAMPLE
	string *old_array, *new_array;
	
	old_array= ({ "one", "two", "three" });
	new_array= reallocate( old_array, 4);
	new_array[ 3]= "four";
