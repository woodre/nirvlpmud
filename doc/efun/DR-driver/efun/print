SYNOPSIS
	string print( string text)
	string print( string text, int linewidth)

DESCRIPTION
	Format the string 'text' and then write it, using the usual write efun.
	See format(E) for details on the formatting. The only difference is
	that linewidth must be <= TEXT_WIDTH here.
	TEXT_WIDTH cannot be changed, and is probably set to 70.

EXAMPLE
	print( "This text was formatted before it was sent to output.\n",
	40);
	/* result:
	This text was formatted before it was
	sent to output.
	*/
