void enable_commands()

Enable this object to use commands normally accessible to players.
This also marks the current object as "living".
Commands defined by 'player.c' will not be accessible, of course.

This function must be called if the object is supposed to interact
with other players.

Avoid to call this function from other places then reset(), because the
command_giver will be set to the this object.
