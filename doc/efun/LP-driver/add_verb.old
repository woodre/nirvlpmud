void add_verb(str)
string str;

This function is connected to the "add_action()" function. It will set up
the command "str" to trigger a call to the function set up by the
previous call to "add_action()".

This function is now obsolete as the verb can be given directly with
add_action(). add_verb() remains for compatibility.
