void destruct(ob)
object ob;

Completely destroy and remove object "ob". The argument can also be a string.
After the call to destruct(), no global variables will exist any longer,
only local, and arguments.

If an object self-destructs, it will immediately terminate execution and
return 0. There is one exception: If the destruct-statement is followed by
a 'return 1' immediately after, then this return statement will be executed.

If someone carried the object that was destructed, his local weight will
be updated.
