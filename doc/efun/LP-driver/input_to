void input_to(fun, flag)
string fun;
int flag;

Enable next line of user input to be sent to the local function "fun" as
an argument. The input line will not be parsed.

Note that "fun" is not called immediately. It will not be called until
the current execution has terminated, and the player has given a new
command.

If input_to() is called more than once in the same execution, only the
first call has any effect.

If optional argument 'flag' is non-zero, the line given by the player will
not be echoed, and is not seen if snooped.

See also call_other(), sscanf().
