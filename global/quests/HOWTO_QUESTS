Note: If you're not sure what you have to do after reading the
      following please contact a member of the administration. He
      will know.

First you need an identifier for your quest, it's a single word, for example
"happy_slaughter". This gives you the filename of the quest-file,
e.g. /global/quests/happy_slaughter_quest.c.

This file has to inherit "complex/quest"; and has to - in create -
do several function calls:

set_title(string short_desc);
    - the quest's short description, that's the a single line not
      longer than 50 characters. For example:
      "Solve the new quest!"

set_short_title(string very_short_desc);
    - a very short description of the quest which would fit into
      a sentence 'the quest <very_short_desc>' e.g.  'with the orcs'

set_author(string name);
    - the name of the quest's author

set_quest_points(int qp);
    - the quest's questpoints, for example 80.

set_low_level(int l);
    - the lower level limit you designed this quest for, for example
      you built a quest which shouldn't be solved below level 8, this
      value should be 8.

set_high_level(int h);
    - an upper level 'limit' or better suggestion you designed this quest
      for. Of course, a quest designed for level x, can be solved with
      level x+10 as well, but that doesn't matter here. The upper level
      limit shall be the maximum level you think you're quest is suitable
      for. Let this be 15 in our example because we designed our quest
      especially for levels 8 to 15.

set_duration(string time);
    - a specification about the time duration of the quest. Possible are
      "extralow " meaning 0 to 1 hour
      "low"       meaning 1 to 2 hours
      "medium"    meaning 2 to 3 hours
      "high"      meaning 3 to 6 hours
      "extrahigh" meaning more than 6 hours

set_description(mixed desc);
    - a description being a complex message which describes your
      quest more closely, you may any M_ME token inside, it is evaluated
      to the person which explains the quest to the player. You also
      may use M_PL-tokens, e.g.
         ({ ({ M_SAYS, "Oh, yes, the new quest." }),
            4,
            ({ M_ME_THE, " smiles at ", M_PL, "." }),
            4,
            ({ M_SAYS, "You just have to ...." })
         })

Aforementioned calls are necessary, the following ones are optional, 
depending on your quest:

set_part_duration(string time);
    - if your quest can be splitted up in several parts which needn't to
      be solved during one and the same session choose a number which 
      describes the about length of one of the quest's parts like you did
      for the duration of the whole quest. Our example-quest shall be
      dividable and the parts duration shall be "extralow".

set_players(mixed pl);
    - if your quest cannot/need'nt be solved by one player simultaneously.
      Choose:
         -1: if your quest can be solved any amount of players simultaneously,
             this is e.g. the case in chrisp/kobayashi.
          b: the quest requires exactly b (b not 1!!!) players to solve it.
             For example dragoncrown or wales require 2 players to solve it.

set_beginner();
    - is your quest especially designed for utter novices? (This of course
      requires the lower level limit to be 1). If yes, call set_beginner();


set_again_exp_percent(int p);
    - when someone solves your quest for a second, third,... time he will
      receive p percent of the original experience reward as reward,
      p must be between 50 and 100. If you don't specify it, this percentage
      will be set to 50.

    ({ "new_quest", "Solve the new quest!",  
       80,	8,	15,	3,	1,	0,	0 })

After putting happy_slaughter_quest.c in /global/quests you just have to
do 'update /global/server/quests' and the quest has been added to the game.
