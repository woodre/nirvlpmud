Jan  6 13:29 Slacker: i thought it would be cool if we had an object )we could find or kill for) that would have two pieces. One piece would be placed at each of two locations that we could transport back and forth between (say, between a shop and a particular monster's location). Then we could easily grab more heals. Maybe it would have a limited number of available transports. -Slacker
Jan  7 12:54 Nelk: How about a suggestion box?
Jan 12 17:02 Yates: Move box to area north of church, so that people that actually have ideas go post, and less people would abuse it.  Just put up note on board that it's there.

Apr 16 00:18 Pharaoh: we do something about +100 pk...I know that +100 levels have been around a while and have been well accepted, but when they're into PK, as Konya is, it seems like introducing sharks into a bowl of fighting betas. Why set pk when someone 98+ levels higher than you is doing the same?
Apr 16 22:43 Puppy: Working off the party object there could be a way to see the party members hps and sps.  Possibly having party members agree to this would make it "fair."

Apr 21 22:33 Bobby: Weapons

May  7 23:31 Roosterx: there needs to be sunrise on the green. why? so all the nocturnal peeps who play into the wee hours of the morn know the sun has risen. just some atmosphere i guess. it could rise at 6 in the morn (eastern time) and set at like 8 pm or something. just a cool idear is all

Jun 27 00:36 Nodnarb: i think there should be a "super heal" made. i think it would be cool if you could buy a heal for about 20k coins, and it would have about 70 uses, that automatically heals you all hp and sp, and toxes about 7%
Jun 27 00:37 Nodnarb: i believe that it would be cool if there would be something where you could trade free experence for coins
Jun 29 14:51 Yorick: Don't let Revenge use triggers

Jul  2 02:53 Yorick: Maledicta inform people when he makes changes to their guild.

Aug 12 10:36 Potter: I think that if we get killed in a PK match, then we shouldn't lose our items or coins or XP!
Aug 13 12:05 Flood: why not just make Triggers Legal, rather than spend all your valubal wiz time trying to stop them...just an idea
Aug 13 14:43 Kamui: I liked the new no exp/gear loss pk rules.
Aug 19 14:34 Yorick: 'boo' emote, :screams boo in (player)'s face.

Sep 22 11:12 Helpme: Make only 2 bites for the vampire guild
Sep 24 19:46 Potter: There should be free coins laying about.
Oct 13 20:54 Roy: You remove the shardak's ability to kill a lvl 13 with the typing of 'get all' it's ridiculious how a shard can fight a pk battle in green, I can pick something up at full health, 202 hps. and die. it fucking amazes me what you guy's think about before you decide to approve it.

Nov  3 01:30 Cerberus: I have 2 Ideas for ya, 1. sence your changing the stats around anywayse, I had an Idea to help benifet the board out of there mind players: how about being able to raise your Mag and Sta to 1000 extra than what you can get with lvls. not an easy task tho, how about 1,000,000 xp/hp til you reach 500 hps extra, and 2,000,000 xp/hp from 500-1000 extra hps, and sps being the same...sound like a good idea? ehh? heh...ohh and on top of that, how about when a player gets to +100 and gets his 1000 extra hps and sps, they become a mortal wizard, they have all guild objects, plus a wizard object that maby lets them find out all info on weps and armors and shit. I dunno just some wack ideas...2. stop telling players about your new code, let them find out it will be more fun that way...               Cerberus
Nov 12 11:39 Diabla:  quirk -quirks an eyebrow.-  smooch -gives NAME a big sloppy smooch
Nov 12 15:31 Diabla: I don't think that someone should just be forced into hotel or motel rooms.  I think an invitation should be sent to the player.  It is unfair in pk to have someone just spamming invite invite or triggering it and not giving a person the ability to flee combat.
Nov 13 17:46 Zidane: I think we should be able to make our own color titles...I've been dieing to have one and makeing a color title should be like chooseing ansiprefs (for example) I type ctitles and itwould ask what color do you want your title? and you pick a color and it stays even after and before reboot...I am dying to have a color title, please consider my ote in near future
Nov 19 16:36 Zidane: Good day, I was wondering if you can open Qualtor or Qualter back up Boltar? I am sure other players would enjoy it being here, just like you restored "The Wheel of Time" I used to kill there many of times and was a good exp, coin and equipment place....Please reopen it, or at least a bit of it.......Sincerily, Zidane Veers
Dec  4 15:26 Zidane: I suggest that you make "Cloak of the Night Sky" storable, and Nodachi as well, us players would very much like for at least those 2 items to store and I am sure they will thank you, please make at least Nodachi store, besides I am persoanly fond of it and I know for a fact that everyone else will be happier.....Your talented general, Zidane. P.S. I like what you did with the lost and found thing there Boltar...you clever thing....
Dec 23 15:03 Zidane: Good day I suggest that we are able to make our own multicolored titles like for instance, I can have the title the small hunter and I can make hunter green and small blue, we could put it in ansipref, I noticed some people have multi colored titles and I was wonder if you can make that happen example, my title is "pilot of a Mad Cat MK 11" I could make Mad red and cat yellow, I hope you get what I am saying but please, invent it or make it happen
Dec 30 09:40 Zidane: could you put qualtor back please right at it's original spot
Jan 25 01:24 Yorick: Knights have a theme

Mar  1 15:08 Slacker: new item for sc
Mar  1 15:10 Slacker: it would be nice to have an item added to the sc (or sc2) that shows how many "extra" xp's you've accumulated thus for... so you could see how many you have to play with...kinda like xpnext.. but the opposite...
Mar 18 01:36 Lans: scroll

Jul 14 04:55 Humble: Tweak with cyberninjas so a level 8 cyberninja with stacked commands can't instablick you? I mean honestly, come on
Jul 17 03:53 Humble: Monsters that are worth 20k that can do 200 hps of damage to you in one round, should probably check those before approving them.
Jul 22 04:24 Humble: Bring back Dark City
Jul 22 04:24 Humble: Don't make Wind able to do 250+ damage to you in a single round, YOU FUCK
Jul 22 08:34 Humble: Since we lose equip and exp in pk, discouragin people from pking, why not go back to the old ways and gain a small amount of exp from the deal
Jul 23 20:27 Zalard: DON"T FUCKING KILL PEOPLE WHEN THEY FUCKIGN DIE YOU FUCKING FAGGOT
Jul 24 08:22 Humble: Boltar: talk with your wizards and tell them you don't wiz people here just so they can code what they want and not help players or fix bugs. your coders have gotten ridiculious in the past 5 years
Jul 26 06:21 Humble: If You beef up the Bug Storm, make it between 180-250k, it's pretty tough when it rebuilds 5-6 times
Jul 29 06:30 Humble: DOwnsize cybers in some aspect, they are super beefy, I mean SUPER beefy in every aspect.
Aug  1 21:42 Fastkill: i think l
Aug  1 21:45 Fastkill: i think yous should make it to where healers can either buy heals half price, or get them for free, and lwt only healers use them, cause healers cant help the fact that they have no money, and they are provideing a public service in a way to all those who play the mud
Aug  5 01:20 Kudzu: Pirate Guild!

Sep 23 18:49 Billy: when you type in 'afk' it will put a afk sign beside your name on the 'who2' list and then when you type something in and press enter then it will automatically take the afk sign off
Sep 26 05:23 Fenfir: You fix the heartbeat problem so people don't get hit with monster special 4 seconds after they have left the room
Sep 28 00:28 Billy: I think there should be "dead bolts" on the casa de nirvana hotel room (When you store your stuff you type 'deadbolt' and then it deadbolts it so there is EXTRA security but you have to save and quit in your room
Sep 30 21:32 Fenfir: you never close the museum and just take out certian mobs that are bugged
Oct  5 12:20 Billy: Since the Bottomless Bags are bottomless, I think that the bag should not get heavier. I think it should stay at light weight
Oct  6 07:55 Billy: If your in the polymorph guild and you complete the ele test, and then you leave the polymorph guild, I think your elemental warrior stats should be DELETED
Oct  6 07:55 Billy: Sephiroth being banned forever (Along with Grog and Shenji)
Oct 14 21:19 Coldchain: you take Cyberninjas, Dark Order and BCM from the game, Keep strong necromancers, fallen, warriors, neo symbiotes and some other guilds.  Those first 3 guilds are way overpowered, neos used to be overpowered along with warriors but these days, cyberninjas dominate in pk, ridiculously.
Nov  4 16:25 Slay: Make the fleeing pk victom hit his attacker once befor thay can run anywere.
Nov  5 03:46 Juiblex: along with being able to "list weapons" and "list armors" in the shop, how about "list heals"?
Jan  3 17:44 Slacker: it would be nice to have a command that would muffle all channels... (including msg) for undisturbed letter writing, for instance... then you could unmuffle-all... and whatever channels you were previously listening to would be restored... (this, instead of having to do each separately). - Slacker
Jan  3 17:50 Slacker: how about a public channel that didn't echo the speaker... everyone would speak anonynously... see what kind of communication this might encourage... might add the option of giving yourself a channel name (that could be changed)... {anon} What's this channel for? - Slacker
Jan 31 07:10 Fenfir: That when teddy and offwielded weapon is kept, or you are eaten by a sarawak, the items be made saveable or restorable at least, they always disappear when anything bad happens, always.
