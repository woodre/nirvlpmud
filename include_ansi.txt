/players/data/closed/Wizardguild.txt:109:            There will be so far 2 different types of pets. One that will be designed to take side damage, but wont inflict damage. The other is that it will take side damage like a normal pet, but it will do damage to the mob as well. Players will have a choice. Either they can use a wocket pet, a pet from green or a demon. If you have any one of these pets and you create a pet. The other pet will die instantly. If you have your guild pet out, and you buy or receive a pet. The new pet will die. The guild pet will always be the only one to live. Wizards can change the short for the pet. The only thing it cannot do is name a pet after a player. Not sure of other blocks...but I just thought how evil it would be to have Wocket's snail following you....or icingdeath for that matter. The wizard can make the names in ansi and create a description. The pet will start out with default battle emotes. Later on when the wizard has put enough care into his pet, he can change them so it is more in theme of his creation. Like if I had a pet and it was a Shinga it would say something like shinga rips so and so with it's teeth. But if it was well abilitied, I could change it and add ansi so it would say Shinga the Underworld Beast uses it's tusks to render so and so. The more a wizard cares for his pet, the more options that will become available. The only thing that I wont allow for pet emotes is for it to be spammy....so someone cant make one that takes up 80 lines. The pets cannot attack in no attack rooms, and hoth will be able to attack them. But if hoth does attack them the pets will have a chance as long as the player doesnt panic. By giving the pet a sort of 5 heart beats of complete defense. That way the wizard can attack hoth and kill it, or else release the pet and summon it when all is clear. Pets will be ammune to hoth's charms though....so the pet wont attack his master. To gain this ability, one must find a object of rarity and value and use his/her gift to change it. The creature must be living. If the pet dies, you will have to reget a living creature, but rather than go throught he whole process again of changing things it will go to where you last had it at, minus some strength which the player has to work to regain it's pet's strength. Cause it would take time to redo it, the short, the description, the battle emotes, etc. Or if the player chooses they can start from scratch. as it will be cheaper in the cost of sp. If the pet is started from where it was last off there will be a slightly higher cost, but players may thing it is worth it compared to the time of redoing everything. (planned as a update once I get a area up or two. Sort of like a mini quest for the guild)

wrong, She did every one of them in, them in,She did every one of them in.One morning in a fit of pique, Sing Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,One morning in a fit of pique, She drowned her father in the creek,The water tasted bad for a week, And we had to make do with gin, with gin,And we had to make do with gin.Her mother she could never stand, Sing Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,Her mother she could never stand, And so a cyanide soup she planned,Her mother died with a spoon in her hand, And her face in a hideous grin, a grin,And her face in a hideous grin.She set her sister's hair on fire, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,She set her sister's hair on fire, And as the smoke and flame rose higher,Danced around the funeral pyre, Playing a violin, o-lin,Playing a violin.She weighted her brother down with stones, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,She weighted her brother down with stones, And sent him off to Davy JonesAll they ever found were some bones, And occasional pieces of skin, of skin,And occasional pieces of skin. One day when she had nothing to do, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,One day when she had nothing to do, She cut her baby brother in two,And served him up as an Irish stew, And invited the neighbors in, bors in,and invited the neighbors in.And when at last the police came by, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,And when at last the police came by, Her little pranks she did not deny,To do so she would have had to lie, And lying she knew was a sin, a sin,And lying she knew was a sin.My tragic tale I will not prolong, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,My tragic tale I will not prolong, And if you do not enjoy my song,You've yourselves to blame if it's too long, You should never have let me begin, beginYou should never have let me begin.**See, my days are cold without youBut Im

of reddest stolen berries. Come away, O human childTo the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand;The world's more full of weeping than you can understand. Where the wand'ring water gushesFrom the hills above glen'Car,In pools among the rushesThat scarce could bathe a star,We seek for slumb'ring troutAnd, whispering in their ears,Give them unquiet dreamsFrom ferns that drop their tears. Come away, O human childTo the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand;The world's more full of weeping than you can understand. Away with us he's going,The solemn-eyed;He'll no more hear the lowingOf the cows on the warm hillside. For he comes, the human childTo the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand;The world's more full of weeping than he can understand. Words: WB YeatsTune: Kate Price**She, she really loves the simple thingsShe can't afford no diamond rings,And wouldn't wear them if she could.She hits me like a cool summer rainthen she's gone on the windBut I can hear her whisper in the woodsAnd I can see the oceanWhen I look into her eyesMy heart is swept awayLike a paper boat on the tideI'm destined to run aground, with her by my sideTogether we'll wake upto a watercolor sunriseShe, she's been running in the rainShe's like whiskey on my brainShe makes me feel so highShe, she's got holes in her stockingsNow she's up and unlocking the door for meAnd I can see the oceanWhen I look into her eyesMy heart is swept away Like a paper boat on the tideI'm destined to run aground, with her by my sideTogether we'll wake up, to a watercolor sunrise.No on really knows where she's from.She comes and she goes like a watercolor bleeds and runs awayWhat am I afraid of? Here she comes....She, she really loves the simple thingsCan't afford no diamond ringsAnd wouldn't wear them if she couldShe, she's got holes in her stockingsNow she's on the front porch rockingThe baby to sleep**How do I say goodbye to what we had?

But I tried...How do you feel?What do you say?Where is my world?Living for today.Extinction happens every dayOne species at a time.God's creation blown away.To care my only crime(Chorus:)I never said it was easy.I never said it was free.I only said it would be worth it.If you follow me...IF you follow ME!How is your anger?How is your rage?Where are your morals?Living in a cage.The enemy is in your mind.A terrible thing to taste.Self Control is so hard to find.When Your life is such a waste.(Chorus)How is the deadly intrepid fearThat you have to live with.year after year.All we are is the dust of a Star.Shaped by the makers hand.He really is not so far.Dancing to a cosmic end...(chorus)How do you feel?If you met God today?What would you do?What would yo say?I gave up!...But I Tried!I gave up......But I tried...I gave up......but I tried...I gave up...

out rightThough I tried not to hurt youThough I triedBut I guess that's why they sayChorus:Every rose has its thornJust like every night has its dawnJust like every cowboy sings his sad, sad songEvery rose has its thornYeah it doesI listen to our favorite song playing on the radioHear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and easy goBut I wonder does he knowHas he ever felt like thisAnd I know that you'd be here somehow If I could have let you know somehowI guessChorusThough it's been a while nowI can still feel so much painLike a knife that cuts you the wound healsbut the scar, that scar remainsI know I could have saved a love that nightIf I'd known what to sayInstead of makin' loveWe both made our separate waysBut now I hear you found somebody newand that I never meant that much to youTo hear that tears me up insideAnd to see you cuts me like a knifeI guessChorus**Upon the darkened nightThe flame of love was burning in my breast.And by a lantern bright.I fled my house while all in quiet rest.Shrouded by the nightAnd by the secret stair I quickly fled.The veil concealed my eyes.While all within lay quiet as the dead.ChorusOh night thou was my guide.Oh night more loving than the rising sun.Oh night that joined the lover,To the beloved one.Transforming each of them into the other.Upon the misty night.In secrecy, beyond such mortal sight.Without a guide or light.Than that which burned so deeply in my heart.The fire 'twas led me on.And shined more bright than of the midday sun.To where he waited stillIt was a place where no one else could come.ChorusWithin my pounding heart.Which kept itself entirely for him.He fell into his sleep.Beneath the cedars all my love I gave.And by the fortress walls.The wind would brush his hair against his brow.And with its smoothest hand.Caressed my every sense it would allow.ChorusI lost myself to him.And laid my face upon my lover's breast.And care and grief grew dim.As in the morning's mist became the light.There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair.There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair.There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair.**The days are getting oh so long,And the paths so hard to find.How can I ever see the wayWhen I got you on my mind?When I was yours and you were mineThe path seemed oh so clear.But everything is dark as night,Now that you're not here.When I was yours, and you were mine,I said I'd love youFor all time.I thought you loved me, and maybe you do.But you're with someone else, and I still love you.Now even though you're with another,you can't get rid of me.I told you I'd never let you go,and I meant it you will see.Though I'm not yours and you're not mine,I am still here to say,"I told you that I loved you and I'll stick with you all ways."When I was yours, and you were mine,I said I'd love youFor all time.I thought you loved me, and maybe you do.But you're with someone else, and I still love you.**Got a picture of your house, with you standign by the door, its black and white and faded and lookin pretty worn,I see the factory

that first moment we metWhen two worlds crashed inAnd I found my best friendYou're a GodsendAn angel from above(He sent an angel)You've been Godsent to me(you know it's true)You're the Godsend(God sent an angel)I've been dreaming of(God sent an angel to me)You're a Godsend(Yes, He did, yes, He did)God sent an angel to meYou're my Godsend(God sent you down)Yes, you are, that's what you are.Yes, you are, that's what you are.the song is written by Michael Tait and performed by DC Talk. i dedicate that song to the true maiden and angel that God sent me a year and a half ago. I vow to love, honor, and cherish her all my days. To God be the glory!**Drowning deep in my sea of laothingBroken your servant I kneel(will you give in to me)It seems what's left of my human side is slowly changing in me(will you give in to

reed.That drowns the tender reed.~~~~~~Some say love it is a razorThat leaves the soul to bleed.Some say love it is a hunger, an endless aching need.But I say love it is a flowerAnd you it's only seed.It's the heart afraid of dyingIt's the heart afraid of breakingThat never learns to danceIt's the dream afraid of wakingThat never takes the chance.It's the one that won't be takenThat cannot seem to give.And the soul afraid of dyingThat never learns to live.When the night has been too lonely,And the road has been too long,And you think that love is onlyFor the lucky and the strong,Just remember in the winterFar beneath the bitter snowLies the seed, that with the sun's loveIn the spring, becomes the rose.**I've told you this, once, before, can't

the air.You better watch out,There may be dogs aboutI've looked over Jordan, and I have seenThings are not what they seem.What do you get for pretending the danger's not real.Meek and obedient you follow the leaderDown well trodden corridors into the valley of steel.What a surprise!A look of terminal shock in your eyes.Now things are really what they seem.No, this is no bad dream.The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not wantHe makes me down to lieThrough pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by.With bright knives He releaseth my soul.He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places.He converteth me to lamb cutlets,For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger.When cometh the day we lowly ones,Through quiet reflection, and great dedicationMaster the art of karate,Lo, we shall rise up,And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water.Bleating and babbling I fell on his neck with a scream.Wave upon wave of demented avengersMarch cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream.Have you heard the news?The dogs are dead!You better stay homeAnd do as you're told.Get out of the road if you want to grow old.~ Pink Floyd**Yesterday is a

wond'rous;And the parle of voices thund'rous;With the whisper of heaven's treesAnd one another, in soft easeSeated on Elysian lawnsBrows'd by none but Dian's fawns;Underneath large blue-bells tented,Where the daises are rose-scented,And the rose herself has gotPerfume which on earth is not;Where the nightingale doth singNot a senseless, tranced thing,But divine melodious truth;Philiosphic numbers smooth;Tales and golden historiesOf heaven and her mysteries.Thus ye live on high, and thenOn earth ye live again;And the souls ye left behind youTeach us, here, the way to find you,Where your other souls are joying,Never slumber'd, never cloying.Here, your earth-born souls still speakTo mortals, of their little week;Of their sorrows and delights;Of their passions and their spites;Of their glory and their shame;What doth strengthen and what maim.Thus ye teach us, every day,Wisdom, though fled far away.Bards of Passion and of Mirth,Ye have left your souls on earth!Ye have souls in heaven too,Double-lived in regions new!John Keats, c. 1818**As the rain falls in August...and i see the worms crawl and drown in puddles.i wonder hbow

Instead, make it a refresh spell, and let the monkcall squirrels or something to donate part of their life force.the sps will be used to call, the hps gained, and the time peroidpreserved waiting for the animals.The second  idea is for the the hp mon and the monk stats opetions to display how many how many shields we are using.**weenis envy(smaug):**'ve lost all our heroes in pop culture.  They're murderers and wife beaters (OJ and Tyson know who they are) or greedy (aka 80% of pro baseball...)  And people wonder why we are disenchanted with sports...Colleges fix grades for atheletes, and they even show their appreciation by leaving for otherinstitutions which give them a bigger car....Go minor league baseball.  Watch it and be part of it the way baseball was ment to layed.  Watch those neighborhood soball matches.Play street hockey!Go Lansing Lugnuts!!!Smaughactually, Smaug but it's early in the morning...**is anybody out there?(smaug):**Does anyone else ever come here?  apparantly not since I'm the only onewho's written anything in the last month or so.  humm.....   **smaug i am here(martha):**look i am here.it's been a while, but you know, i have been busy fighting with wizzes andall that good stuff.hocey is cool.i want to playi like it.GO OSWEGO LAKERS!!!woo hooo zwick rulesgo nate!!!oswegooswegoowegooswegoyay!**CFL!  (Okay, it's the wrong season..)(porkypig):**Oskie wee wee!Oskie wa wa!Holy mackinaw!Tigers!  Eat 'emraw!Why is it so dead around here?Your loyal monk,porky**9(porkypig):****"

Its more of a helper title. Also if any bugs or issues come upthat I need to address you can pass them through her or post them on these boards.

We took in a lot of warriors and probably a few symbiotes when their guilds closed. They have done a good job as polys for the most part and it was nice seeing more people around. However I know a few of themwere polys before the warriors and I especially know the ones whom I had to edit them back into Spuck's good graces were. The point of this note is that I'm not going to be quite so swift to invite in the next time. We have an open door policy for new members but if you have been and then ditched us for a more powerful guild I'm not going to bend over to let you back in. This is just a for instance and applies to bailing out for other guilds as well. We are a pretty forgiving groupbut I am tired of this being the 'safe date' guild where people go ifthey have extra xp and have been dumped or dropped from other guilds.Other than that everyone is doing fine. Like I said this isn't to growlat anyone. Its just so that I have something I can point back to if it happens some time in the future.

I'm working on figuring out why its happening but I've noticed that itusually is tied to monsters that have extra code for death. So just a small warning that larger monsters that say something or drop anitem after death may be prone to this bug. Thats the only similarityI've found.  I'll try to fix this as soon as I can. Just be aware it could happen but its not popped up too much. Good huntingSomeone**[Mizan, Mon Oct  6 22:12:51 2003]  Tug Policy:**Tug policy is being changed. It is being done in phases. Right nowthe first phase is that people who are over a certain level, withunfavorable push-to-tug ratios will be flat out denied the abilityto tug new items.The next phase, the composite value of what is being pushed/tuggedwill be checked. Other little tweaks will be done to keep it frombeing abused. I really hate to do this, but watching how some peopleconstantly keep the tug filled while others mooch away at it irealized that this behavior needs to come to a stop.Bear in mind that i hold tug/push offenses fairly high in disregard.No real specifics need to be mentioned about how it works and whatis considered a 'bad thing'. I'll leave common sense for you to judgeon that level.-mMizan**[Mizan, Mon Oct 13 22:21:03 2003]  Polymorph Treehouse:**Polymorph Treehouse just got a bit more interesting.It has been pointed out that we have a catapultin there but nothing to shoot with.That has now been addressed.have fun!-mMizan**[Mizan, Tue Oct 14 09:44:17 2003]  Spuckball, Spucktrooper- gobble all, spew all:**You can now 'gobble all' or 'spew all' in Spuckball and Spucktrooperforms.

Therefore some codechanges have been put in effect to prevent offense-mindedplayer killing attacks from happening.Bear in mind that i am not trying to fault anyone for anything. A few changes to the game lib were done that made it possible for polys toinitiate PK combat, and i am merely addressing those changes.Thanks,-mizMizan**[Mizan, Fri Nov  7 22:59:37 2003]  New stuff- wumpus, catapult changes:**Some new stuff everyone should be aware of...Wumpus has a new ability. Defecate. All it does it makes a pile of crap.I'm not kidding. The pile is fairly dangerous if eaten.Makes a good gag item to hit monsters with. To wash off the stains if you are hit, pelt yourself with a few water balloons to wash it off.Next item. Catapult has a 5 second delay between shots now. Some people were triggering too many launches so i had to do something about it. Otherwise it is unchanged. Have fun :)-mizMizan**[Mizan, Fri Nov 21 23:09:18 2003]  PK REALM ACCESS CHANGES:**As previously mentioned, someone has committed a very grave offensein the guild. Luring lower level players into open PK realms isa sure fire way to get us an undeserved reputation as a newbiekilling machine. In the past I have banned players from the guildoutright.As punishment I gave the offender two choices.1) They can quit the guild, and nobody has to deal with this    unpleasantness, and the issue is dropped.2) They can stay in the guild, but everyone else has to suffer for   it. Polys now take 5HP damage per heartbeat simply standing in   a PK realm.It can be inferred that the player involved picked the selfish choice.How long will this 'Red Text of Death' last? Ask Southstar.-miz.Mizan**[Mizan, Sat Nov 22 13:01:17 2003]  PK restriction lifted.:**Southstar chose to leave the guild, fter someconsiderable hedging, so the PK restriction has been liftedMizan**[Mizan, Sat Nov 22 19:15:01 2003]  Stat adjustments:**It was brought to my attention today that players with more than20 STA or MAG were not getting the full bonuses (or detriments)when assuming forms such as Tetrapod.

In factin the past, polys used to take damage when that happened. But now all thathappens is Spuck spams you with tells when you are indeed in such an area.Bear in mind that if you do enter a PK area, you do so at your own risk.Please be careful. Please realize that polys can be attacked like any otherplayer when in such an area. Please understand that if you are attacked andkilled you can either run or fight- but that no accumulative action can betaken against the attackers other than what you decide to do on your own.I'm actually not in a bad mood- i'm just annoyed that people are spewingtheir own brand of verbal diarrhea and attaching my name to it. That sortof stuff will stop.Thanks for reading,-mizMizan**[Earwax, Tue Nov 29 02:00:50 2005]  Guild status:**As Mizan is presently inactive, and will remain so for the forseeablefuture, I'm the interim guild wiz.

If there's anything I need to take a look at or address, feel free to mudmail me or send me a tell if I'mon and active.Regarding guild commanders, I haven't seen any active polys really,so that's up in the air.

I am considering making an implementation where people can onlyassume morph forms a certain number of times per _day_. For example youcan only tetrapod 5 times in a 24 hour period. Other forms would be moreplentiful such as bogglemancer or spucktrooper.I realize that something like this might not really rub off as agood thing to people. It seems like i am clamping down when I am not.Other ideas that were tossed around were making it so that in order totetrapod you have to assume another morph form first- such as Golem. It madesense in the real world as in if you wanted to fly the F16, you had tospend time in the trainer first. However this idea sucks in that it restrictswhat you can morph into. I don't want to do that.

If we all used the other formsmore, we'd most likely realize all the work Mizan does to keep thisthe coolest guild on the mud - and we'd probably find out ther welike the puffball or bogglemancer or whatever just as good (maybemore) than tetra.  But if you invest your xp in a guild, you reallyshouldn't be given a lot of restrictions on your earned abilities.I mean - I LOVE WUMPUS!  I really think that you should leave wellenough alone - if someone likes tetrapod, let 'em use it all theywant - that's why we spend our hard-earned xp in the first place.But in light of my keep it as it is stance, here are some otherideas/thoughts to think about:********** continued on next post:  Form Limits #2 **********Forbin**[Forbin, Thu Aug 30 16:55:53 2001]  Form Limits #2:**PROPOSAL #1This is sort of similar to the extra levels that you can get onceyou reach level 19 - you know, 19+1, 19+2, etc.  It involves usingmore experience to advance in the guild, but it might be worth it.A given polymorph guild member would, upon reaching each level, beallowed to morph into each form _no_more_ than 5 times in any 24hour period.  (This will keep the penalty from being assessed onlyto the multi-limbed forms)  Once you reach level 5, you can beginto advance higher in BONUS levels.  Each bonus level allows you topolymorph one extra time per form.  Example - a guild level 5+2 polywould be able to change into a puffball, tetra, tree, etc. 7 times in agiven 24 hour period.  Here are my thoughts on the levels and the xpthey should/could take:Guild Level 5+1     1 extra morph     450,000Guild Level 5+1     2 extra morphs    550,000Guild Level 5+3     3 extra morphs    650,000Guild Level 5+4     4 extra morphs    800,000Guild Level 5+U     unlimited      1,000,000********** continued on next post:  Form Limits #3 **********Forbin**[Forbin, Thu Aug 30 17:01:49 2001]  Form Limits #3:**PROPOSAL #2:This method is most likely easier to code, although I favor myfirst idea.If you set the limit on _each_form_ (not just multi-limbed) to 5, youcould possible allow extra morphing (past 5) by forcing the 6ht, 7th,etc. times you morph require ALL 2300 charges, instead of the normalcosts associated with a given form.PROPOSAL #3:You could instead add some sort of 'morph error', so that if you aremorphing into, let's say tetra, and the error occursm you morph intoa random level 5 form.  If you are morphing into a bogglemancer and getan error, you morph into a random level 5 form.  It would work levelby level - a level 3 error would give you a level 3...you wouldn't trymorphing into a level 5 and end up with a level 1 form...but that is apossibility also.Well - I just wanted to start the sounding board adn get some ideasflowing around...But I'd just keep it the way it is and allow curiosity and nature totake its own course.FORBINForbin**[Trpsprngr, Thu Aug 30 17:21:28 2001]  CHANGES  (massive):**I've heard \"the tetrapod guild\" before - and I'llprobably hear it again.  The reason it is used somuch is it's relatively low-maintenance - solid damage without needing to cast/worry about sps.The Tetrapod is basically the Ultimate SoloFighting Machine[tm]  In parties, I'd be hardpressed for a reason to not have a Tetra leadingas well.  Puffball is the Ultimate Damage SidekickMorph though - try it sometime.  Shiver.I don't want to see the guild as \"the tetra club\"either, but frankly without some type of limiterit's just the way it's going to be.  One of thethings I have thought about was to make it so thateach form can only be assumed by one person at atime - For instance if there's someone on as atetrapod, nobody else can use that form until theyrevert.  This has some bad spots, of course - lastthing I'd want to see is \"tetra-war\" over who getsto use the form.  It would either force us to usea variety of forms - and probably partying with eachother more - or it would cause a large amount ofinfighting.  While I'd like to think we could getalong, I kind of doubt it would work out that way.So, this is my Big Idea - How about after reverting(or being forced to revert) you cannot assume thatform again for the amt of time that morph lasts.That would probably encourage others to use otherforms, at least for the 1/2 hr in between eachtetrapod use.  :)  In any case, it would be betterthan only being able to use the form so many timesin a day.gronk!*-* Uncle Trpsprngr *-***[Mizan, Sat Sep  1 03:06:18 2001]  Excellent stuff:**These are really excellent ideas...Very thought provoking by the way. I have not hadto really consider things on this game scale for a while, and its a goodchallenge :)I think i have figured out this whole thing, obviously with feedback fromthose who contributed above. The new morph system will look like this:Each morph form has a reactivity timer associated with it. For exampleSpuckball is 3 minutes, while tetrapod is 30 minutes.Once you morph into a Tetrapod, and revert, you will be unable to assumethat form for another 30 minutes. The clay will tell you when you canreassume that form.In addition to this, each form has a maximum quanta associated with it ofhow many times you can morph into something within a 24 hour period. Thedemarcation is the game clock, at midnight. This of course varies with eachform.If you _really_ want to morph the form and you have exceeded your quanta forthe day, you have to wait for the next day. There is no getting around thesetimers. I will do my best to assign values which are fair without beinginsane about it.(continued on next post)Mizan**[Mizan, Sat Sep  1 03:13:46 2001]  Excellent stuff (2):**People have given me very good ideas and equally impressive insight on thingshappening in the guild.

Death. What happens when you have a tetra form being used and die? You not only lose the use of that form for the day, but you also have to wait to get the tetra back while giving the thing you were killing valuable time to heal up. What is really bothersome is getting killed by something 5 minutes into a tetra especially if it is your last time for the night. Sure, I use 1 other form and thats replicant and thats cause the other forms dont equal the damage I can make while normal. But what needs to be done is so that if death occurs you would be brought back in the form you died in, since having wait times and form limits umbalances this factor making it unfair as well as even hard to get back a corpse amd giving potential thiefs time to rob all your goods. Even though my corpse didnt get looted the first 4 times, I couldnt get my corpse the 5th time due to a very hard kill blocking the entrance to the area, just balance out the limits if death accurs.VodkaVodka**[Dent, Wed Jan 30 16:34:25 2002]  Re: calm at the green:**Bite me.Bite me.People shouldn't fight at the green.

I thank any polys who have helped me understand but I cant survive in a broken down guild, but this isnt the only reason and sure maybe I should use a different form but they all suck, a tetra cant wimpy, I get ip dc and I am dead when I get back so that is one more reason, cause atleast I will be able to wimpy :)Vodka**[Cross, Sun Jan 26 17:41:55 2003]  Tug:**hiWe need more slots in the tug to store stuff in it.Thanks :)Cross**[Thalan, Tue Oct 14 09:46:35 2003]  Expansion of the guild part of score:**I'd like to be able to see spendable exp in the guild part of scoresomething like this:Guild rank:     [1]Clay charges:   [115]Current polymorph: [Spuckball]Spendable Experience: 123455Experience to Next Guild level: 14392Time: (USA CST) Tue Oct 14 09:39:42 2003Panic key is 'c'.Quick-Stat key is 'q'.Regain corpse toggled to MATTER.Countdown until forced reversion: (162 minutes, 6 seconds).Oh yah, and also, experience to next guild level. :)ThalanThalan**[Thalan, Tue Oct 14 09:49:00 2003]  New score2 for polys:**I'd like to be able to get more information about how much experience I needto raise stats.

So that's 50 more hp (at the high end).That's useless, and you pay for it by losing combat abilities!So, if it is useless, why was this approved back in the day? If I'm guessing correct, the +25 sta used to be applied using the old math, which was +8hp per point. So instead it should be +200 hp. That's a bitmore reasonable. To get that set our stats need to be adjusted by +75-100 sta in sponge form.(This assumes that the range is 15-25 or something similiar)The Gummi One**","[Mizan, Sat Sep  1 03:00:17 2001]  Oof. We are finally migrated to mob.c:**Oof. I almost don't know where to begin. First an update on something thathas happened which will have a fairly major impact on how the morphs existin this guild. This discussion assumes a knowledge in some programmingprinciples so if you get confused don't worry. This will be a multipartmessage.The old forms were independently coded. If I wanted a new multilimbed formfor example i basically copied from my tetrapod.c file and cloned thefunctionality line by line to the new form. This made for management problemsif I had lots of morph forms, as a bug with one multilimb form most likelyhad to be fixed by hand on all the others.The new mob engine (morph, not monster object) consolidates all of the majorfunctions for morphing into an object which can be easily templated justlike a monster, for those of you familiar with LPC code. For example, a snip:....inherit \"mob.c\";reset(arg){   if(arg) return;   ::reset();   set_short_desc(\"A dark granite sphere\");   set_long_desc(\"You look into the sphere and see a dark, stony face\\n\"+      \"staring right back.\\n\"+      \"The sphere your current polymorph as a golem.\\n\");   set_helpfile(\"golem\");   set_multilimbed(1, 2);   set_reversion_time(3200);   set_block_say();   set_block_magic();   ... etc. I think the developer crowd out there gets how much of a quantum leap thiscan mean for creating, managing, and testing morph forms.-mizMizan**[Oolabob, Sun Nov 18 19:44:32 2001]  Gawd:**Ugh I need to come back when I can scroll and read my echo-ed text an shit.

Please, never forget what happened.**As we all remember the events of a year ago and mourn in our own little way, we must not forget the soldiers who are still fighting to rid this fine planet of terrorist.Today, at this moment, soldiers are fighing hard in far off places where eyes can not see there bravery. And these are not all unknown soldiers to us all. I know of friends who got deployed, and I say a pray for them to keep them safe.Myself I am also a national guardsmen, and if called upon I will do everything in my power to help in the battle. To honor those brave firefighters and emergency personal who struggled to get as many to safety.To honor the fallen people, and to keep our way of life free.GOD BLESS AMERICAcooper**the following words are from a memorial dated september 6, 1996for another site and purpose, but which apply today:"We must never forget thatfreedom is never really free.It is the most costly thingin the world.  Freedom is never paid in a lump sum.Installments come due in everygeneration.  All any of us can do is offer the generationsthat follow a chancefor freedom.**Memorial is a time of rememberance.We remember those killed on September 11, 2001.Please do not forget this day.I will do anything to help those who need support, and who need help.And i believe that you should as wellIt is an honor to us that people sacrificed their life for their country. Those who surived are the heors and herions who are fighting this battle, and who we hope will win.We will win, we are strong.Be well my friends. and be safe.~Whoa~**As we today remember and reflect on our nation's tragedy...     I am so very, very thankful that Kevin and Howie came home that day...**This is a wonderful memorial dedicated to those who have died, but as Cooper added, do not forget our active military, reserve military, and all the veterans who have given so much to ensure our freedoms.  As a military veteran, the life was hard, and often people forget about those who are serving and have served.  To all those that are serving, you are, and will always be appreciated in my heart.  Do our country proud in all your endevours.  Fair winds and following seas:Vistar**When the phone rings on a cold winter saturday afternoon, I hope that it's you..I'll remember you...for all the small things you seem to forget..Like tying your shoes, or taking my son for a walk in the rain with no umbrella..I'll remember you...when you tossed me in the pool with my wedding dress on...I'll remember you..In the spring when I collect the fallen green tomatoe's, you taught me how to eat..I'll just remember you..**i am not exactly sure how to express my feelings or write down my thoughts about the horrific day of September 11th.all i know is i will never forget where i was, who i was with and how i felt when i first heard the news of a plane crashing into that might building.horrifed, astonished and disbelief was how i felt as i watched America being attacked.....as the day moved on i still had the same feelingsyet as i watched people reuniting with loved ones, victims walking away from the destruction..i began to feel hopeful and joy.you may wonder why i would feel a few ounces of joy on such a day....seeing people walk away from such a tragedy is a miracle to me...it gave me a sense of hope that Americans were strong enough to overcome, put their fears aside and save themselves.i personally do not know what i would of done if i was put in that situation...wether it was being trapped in the tower, sitting in the pentagon or in the air over Pennsylvania...i can not even fathom it.as we all saw the news clips, we watched people plummet to their deaths, race down stairwells and run for their lives from the bellowing smoke and fire.i would hope that i would be strong enough to make it out and not perish, but how can one sit there and say what they would do if they have never been in that situation?you never know what you would do.to this day i still sit in awe as i watch the tragic events repeat on tv....i do believe in 50 years i will still be feeling the same way.i am proud that when American fell to her knees that day..she stood back up as quickly as she fell.i am proud to be an American*Curse***One of the smartest statements that I've ever heard, was one referringto WWII (hitler, camps, etc). Someone once said to me"The day people forget that terrible tradegy...will be the day it begins to happen again.The next time, we may not be so lucky."I think about that statement all the time, and I have realizedthat it is very much true. In the sense, that memory is allwe have left to protect ourselves from the past, and the future.So, with that thought, I urge you to always remember...don't push it to the side, talk about it often...teach your children and your children's children...learn from this, and improve upon one another.Bless those that shed blood for us, they are all heros to me.God Bless America, there are heros in all of us.~Autumn~**One of the first things I saw today when I got to campus wassomeone kicking a chipmunk, which are overly friendly there,then watching it hobble away, broken and in pain.  And Icouldn't help wondering who would do such a thing, andespecially on such a day.  I was afraid we had all alreadyforgotten the horror of that morning last year.  I am thankful I was wrong.  My school had a beautiful ceremonytoday, and most professors on campus cancelled their classesto allow us all to attend.  It was a gorgeous day here, andstanding together as one helped to ease the pain as the bellswere tolled for the known Penn State alumni killed in the attacks.  We all felt a part of it, a connection.  May it everbe that way, and may we never forget.  Forgetting would be, by far,the worst thing that we as a nation could do.  But let us not also,in future years, turn it into a day of picnics and parades.  Weneed to always remember the events of last year in solemnity, andrespect for the lives lost.StarFor those interested in another type of rememberance, there is asite I stumbled upon today.  911memorialquilt.com contains anonline quilt with more than 420,000 patches.

Everyone talks about what heros these people are but what about the guy who was just going into work that day and all of a sudden his building came under attack?  No one seems to talk much about the innocent people that just died while drinking their coffee.

Mirth,Ye have left your souls on earth!Have ye souls in heaven too,Double-lived in regions new?Yes, and those of heaven communeWith the spheres of sun and moon;With the noise of fountains wond'rous;And the parle of voices thund'rous;With the whisper of heaven's treesAnd one another, in soft easeSeated on Elysian lawnsBrows'd by none but Dian's fawns;Underneath large blue-bells tented,Where the daises are rose-scented,And the rose herself has gotPerfume which on earth is not;Where the nightingale doth singNot a senseless, tranced thing,But divine melodious truth;Philiosphic numbers smooth;Tales and golden historiesOf heaven and her mysteries.Thus ye live on high, and thenOn earth ye live again;And the souls ye left behind youTeach us, here, the way to find you,Where your other souls are joying,Never slumber'd, never cloying.Here, your earth-born souls still speakTo mortals, of their little week;Of their sorrows and delights;Of their passions and their spites;Of their glory and their shame;What doth strengthen and what maim.Thus ye teach us, every day,Wisdom, though fled far away.Bards of Passion and of Mirth,Ye have left your souls on earth!Ye have souls in heaven too,Double-lived in regions new!John Keats, c. 1818**As the rain falls in August...and i see the worms crawl and drown in puddles.i wonder hbow

warmed blankets.Talk to meIn a rich glowing toneOf the music in the treesWhen the birds awake at dawn.Sing to meWarm and safe in our bedHold me in your armsCall me lover.An original...by me...whatcha think?**"

It takes only a very minor magical efforton your part [1 sp].**consider cmd(vertebraker):**For those of you who are either unguilded, or belong to guildsthat don't prohibit you from using "mud spells",Type "consider <target>" to gauge someone's AC, WC, and HP.Of course, there is a cost..   5 sps for newbies, 10 for everybody else.			verte**Megalith expands(wren):**Seek the Megalith, a new feature has popped up.Enjoy, happy hunting...--Wren**Fran's laboratory(francesco):**"What? Did Fran open his laboratory for visitors to see?""Yes, seems so.""I also heard that there are some hidden features in it.""Yes, not only experience/coins.""Quest points, maybe?""Who knows, might be worth to go there and check.""Yea, will do as soon as possible.""Nod, me too. Bye, take care.""You too. Bye."(faithfull report of a talk heard in the University Cafeteria)**The Lost Cities Quest(dune):**I have redone the Lost Cities Quest (go to Lothlorien Oracle).Actually, to be more accurate, I've simplified this quest.It has been rennovated, and the quest clues are much mucheasier to figure out. If you are currently working on the quest,not to worry, all your Sithi Stones are still required.Seek the garden of Amerasu, and there, say you will help her.Evil is stirring in Lothlorien, can you save the Sithi?Dune**cpl new notes(vertebraker):**"yoda" is back working as it did before.I also added 'nexp' to the list of variables for your personal combatmonitor.  You can use that to see how much experience you will needfor the next level, without even typing "xpnext".Isn't that cool?**The dragon sleeps deep within the earth(catacomb):**Hear ye! Hear ye!  Nahog has made another glyph within the forgotten cave.  Seek out the mighty dragon deep in the Durkor caverns.Catacomb, Lord of Sivartp.s. For you lazy players the directions to the forgotten cave are 6w,3s,4w,4s,w**Templar Castle(jaraxle):**& Tower of Hope, are now located:6w,3s,4w,5s,w of the green.**PK CHANGES!!! (updated!)(boltar):** Over the last couple weeks I have noticed that free pk has had a very disturbing effect on the mud that I do not like. It has also resultedin casual pk which I don't think works well with those who take PK seriously. So, pk will now be as follows: Unless a level loss cap is reached, the defeated player will loose 1/6of his exp. The victor will gain 1/30 of that loss. So if a 2,000,000exp player is killed, the dead player looses 333,333 exp or less if the level cap is hit. the victor gains 11,111 exp. or 1/30 of what is lost if level cap his hit.Corpse creation and equipment and coin loss will be normal. Normal lossof an attribute will also occur.  I think these changes back towards what we had, will help restore theprevious game play. Changes will automatically go in at the next reboot, soonerif files get reloaded, so proceed as if they are already in effect.8-Nov-2002 22:40 CST. Because some people may have set pk under the old rules, a one-use-onlyturn off is available. Simply type:  turnoffpk **update to treasure (revised)(boltar):** I've revised this note because there has been some confusion regarding the change. What occurs is when you type save or seethe auto save message 10 items that are either weapons or armorsthat are easily savable are recorded in case of a crash or mishapthat destroys your player object. The items must be in the directinventory and not in a bag.  This is *NOT* an on player storage system. This is *NOT* even closeto what the rumors say. It is simply an enhancement to the treasuresystem for crashes. It is something I came up with a couple weeks ago. It is an attempt to prevent crashes from being as damaging.  Storage of items will be advance by long running casino hotel program that addresses the desire for greater storage. This program has beenon going since sept. That said, I repeat my previous warning on the new code, This may produce some interesting bugs, but I think I've got it prettywell covered from the get go. Keep in mind some objects simply won'tsave properly so they won't be restored. All items not stored will result in cash as normal.**addition to brief toggle(boltar):**  The brief toggle now has a third setting, 'detail mode'  currentlythis adds the title of the room above the long, and may be expanded to other info in the future. (er long description) there is anansi pref for room title as well which may be set after you enterdetail mode for the first time. the suggestion for the room title came from coldwind, but Idecided to make it part of a third brief mode. **corpse stealing (revised)(boltar):** From nelk's suggestion, I have made it so that the slayer of recordhas 2 heart beats (4 seconds) to get the corpse before it's free-game. This should cut down on the corpse stealing, but still allow the truelyskillful to pull it off.**death squence additions(boltar):**  Long wanting to add to the death squence, I got an idea today.When a player dies, a tunnel of light will appear. The dead may enterthis tunnel and take it back to the village green. Hope it's useful, butI just made cause I thought it would be a cool thing...**daycare fix/change(boltar):**  Before you got to use 2 kids per reboot, if one died, you couldn't takeout another. I have changed this such that you may have two *living* kidsout at a time. That is, if one gets killed you may take out a third. Hopefully this will work well.**cross-reboot saving (revised)(boltar):** Leveraging the work done to save weapons and armor through a crash, the same number of items (~6 or 7) savable weapons and armors willbe retained if they are on your person when forced to quit becauseof a reboot. Note this ONLY applies to a reboot. nothing elseYou cannot quit out early or the items will be lost, you must let armageddonthe game crasher to force you to quit.I hope this is found helpful. I hope to further expand the crash savingand cross-reboot saving in the near future. However, diku-mud-like savingon the player will not occur, other arragements will be putinto place(note your log in time must be 3:45 pm CST / 4:45 EST or later for thisto work. To get the new code you must fully quit (no reconnect) and log in)**crash/reboot item saving(boltar):**    I have been able to expand these features to include the first 10 items in a player's inventory that save in the lockers. If it successfullysaves in the lockers it should save at the last save one does before acrash or when army quits a person out at reboot.**new commands(boltar):** itemtest  This command is used to list out what the crash/reboot code will record from your inventory for restoration. cashmoney  This command will allow you to take money from your score and convert it into an object in your inventory.(note to get back into your score you will need to put it in  a bag or drop it, then pick it up again. This may be streamlined in the future.)**Wheel of Time(boltar):**  The Wheel of Time is open again with permission of it's creator. If there are any problems with the area please see me, as one of the conditions is a restricted access to the code. It is now located 3 N of it's previous location.**hotel lost and found(boltar):**  As of the next reboot, items that fall out of a hotel room may appear in the lost and found 1e of the lobby. posted 18-nov-2002 23:30 CST**coins(boltar):** I have changed how the coin limit works.The limit is still 80k. However it simply will block people from gettingmore coins once they have more than 80k. in other words if you getup 150k from a crash. you will simply be unable to get more coins.but the 150K will stick until you spend your way down.**cyber invis changes(boltar):**I have added a series of level and attrib checks. If a non-cyber issuperior he will be able to see the cyber in the shadows.It's a player vs. player check, I am going to keep the exact method to myselfbut stealth and intelligence as well as one's level are important**upgrade for cosmo's VDS exp list(boltar):**  I have upgraded and fixed the existing problem with the VDS.With a small addition to the code, the limitation that forced it toupdate the annual list only once per reboot has been removed. The VDS will now update every 3 hours and at reboot time as before.**It's purge time again(boltar):**  I am going to go and purge all player files inactive for more than oneyear. I will try my usual process of if I remember the name, I will move it to inactive. I already did names begining with a,b,and c. However I then decided to post a list. log in to make sure yourcharacter doesn't get purged, spread the word, whatever. do 'help purge2002' to see the list.  It's long, as I haven't done a purgesince this time last year.**additions to multiple(boltar):**  I have added a paragraph to 'help multiple'.read it.that is all**Player-Wizard Liaison(aingeal):**Hello!I will be acting as the "official" liaison between players andwizards.  If you have any thoughts, suggestions, complaints,problems, or minor emergencies, please let me know or (if possible) leave me a mudmail, and I will either addressthe issue or make sure that the wizard who is able to addressthe issue is made aware of it.  I'm happy to answer any questions (within the limits of the rules governing wizards, of course), and in short will be delighted to assist in any way I canto help keep Nirvana running smoothly and to keep itfun for everyone.Yours in service,Aingeal**new command, findsize(boltar):**Some people have been annoyed by not knowing what size they are forarmor before trying the armor on. the command findsize will calculateyour size so you know in advance. Sizes are XXL,XL,L,M,S,XS You may wear your size and one size bigger. **"

of you never need part."The devil he hoisted her onto his backNo peddler was ever so proud of his pack.And when they got to the fork of the roadHe says, "Old woman, you're a hell of a load".And when they got to the gates of HellHe says, "Stoke the fire, boys, we'll roast her well"Then stepped up a demon with ball and chaiShe upped with her foot and kicked out his brainSome demons came down to put her in a sackShe up with her boot and broke all their backsThe demons cried out from up on the wall"Take her back, Daddy, she'll murder us all".The old man was peeking through a crack;When he seen the old devil a-bringing her back.The Devil said "If you would be so kindTake her back farmer, I've changed my mind.""What will you give me for taking her in?"I promise no more than the wages of sin.I've been a Devil most all of my lifeBut I never knew Hell til I met with your wife.If you want to be rid of this feisty old henYou'll never bedevil my  family againThe devil did cry, the devil did howlBut he never returned to the man at the plowThe old man gave his wife a kissFor who could get him a deal like this?This proves that women are better to menThey can all go to hell and come back again**Fighting criminal, defending lifeFearless knights prepared to dieMen who mean just what they sayThe great men of the Elite

willin` to make a deal.When he came across this young swain` on a fiddle and playing it hot.And the devil jumped on a hickorey stump and said, "Boy, tell me whatyou want."I guess you didn`t know, but I`m a fiddle player too.And if you care to take a dare, I`ll make a bet with you.Now you play a pretty good fiddle bow, but give the Devil his due.I`ll bet this fiddle of gold against your soul, `cuz I think I`m better than you.The boy said my name`s Johnny, and it might be a sinbut I`ll take your bet; you`re gonna regret, `cause I`m the best that`sever been.Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard,`Cause Hell`s broke lose in Georgia, and the Devil deals the cards.And if you win, you`ll get this shiny fiddle made of gold,But if you lose, the devil gets your soul...The devil opened up his case and he said, "I`ll start the show."And fire blew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow.And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss.Then a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this...When the devil finished Johnny said, "Well, that`s pretty good`ol son.But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it`s done.CHORUSFire on the mountain run, boys, runThe Devil`s in the house of the risin`sunODODODODODODODODChicken in the bread pan, pickin`outODODOD the doughGranny, does your dog

try again.""I done told you, you son of a bitch, I`m the best that`s ever been."He played...CHORUS**Think of me,think of me fondly,when we've said goodbyeremember me onice in a whileplease

maid I'll sing a song, Sing Rikkity-Tikkity-Tin,About a maid I'll sing a song, Who didn't have her family long,Not only did she do them wrong, She did every one of them in, them in,She did every one of them in.One morning in a fit of pique, Sing Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,One morning in a fit of pique, She drowned her father in the creek,The water tasted bad for a week, And we had to make do with gin, with gin,And we had to make do with gin.Her mother she could never stand, Sing Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,Her mother she could never stand, And so a cyanide soup she planned,Her mother died with a spoon in her hand, And her face in a hideous grin, a grin,And her face in a hideous grin.She set her sister's hair on fire, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,She set her sister's hair on fire, And as the smoke and flame rose higher,Danced around the funeral pyre, Playing a violin, o-lin,Playing a violin.She weighted her brother down with stones, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,She weighted her brother down with stones, And sent him off to Davy JonesAll they ever found were some bones, And occasional pieces of skin, of skin,And occasional pieces of skin. One day when she had nothing to do, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,One day when she had nothing to do, She cut her baby brother in two,And served him up as an Irish stew, And invited the neighbors in, bors in,and invited the neighbors in.And when at last the police came by, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,And when at last the police came by, Her little pranks she did not deny,To do so she would have had to lie, And lying she knew was a sin, a sin,And lying she knew was a sin.My tragic tale I will not prolong, Rikkity-Tikkity-tin,My tragic tale I will not prolong, And if you do not enjoy my song,You've yourselves to blame if it's too long, You should never have let me begin, beginYou should never have let me begin.**See, my days are cold without youBut Im hurtin while Im with youAnd though my heart cant take no moreI cant

get up and leaveNo more broken heart for meNo more tellin your lies to meIm lookin like I got my head on right, so now I seeNo more givin you everythingTheres no more takin my love from meSee,

candlelight, no CristaltonightIf its alright wit you we f***in (Thats cool)Dj vu, the blood spark, finger f***in in the parkThis is your Bacardi DarkRemember when I used to play between your legs, youbegged for me to stopBecause you know where it would head, straight to yourmothers bedNot the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spotNext to your sister, damn, I really missThe way she used to rub my back when I hit thatWay she used to giggle when your ask would wiggleNow I know youre used to suites at the Park orMeridianTrips to the Caribbean, but tonight no endsYou must be used to me cryin, cryinWhile youre out bumpin and grindinBut Im leavin you tonightSee, my days are cold without youBut Im hurtin while Im with youAnd though my heart cant take no moreI cant keep running back to youYou must be used to me cryin, cryinWhile youre out bumpin and grindinBut Im leavin you tonight**Where dips the rocky highlandOf Sleuth Wood in the lake,There lies a leafy islandWhere flapping herons wakeThe drowsy water rats.There we've hid our faery vatsFull of cherriesAnd of reddest stolen berries. Come away, O human childTo the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand;The world's more full of weeping than you can understand. Where the wand'ring water gushesFrom the hills above glen'Car,In pools among the rushesThat scarce could bathe a star,We seek for slumb'ring troutAnd, whispering in their ears,Give them unquiet dreamsFrom ferns that drop their tears. Come away, O human childTo the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand;The world's more full of weeping than you can understand. Away with us he's going,The solemn-eyed;He'll no more hear the lowingOf the cows on the warm hillside. For he comes, the human childTo the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand;The world's more full of weeping than he can understand. Words: WB YeatsTune: Kate Price**She, she really loves the simple thingsShe can't afford no diamond rings,And wouldn't wear them if she could.She hits me like a cool summer rainthen she's gone on the windBut I can hear her whisper in the woodsAnd I can see the oceanWhen I look into her eyesMy heart is swept awayLike a paper boat on the tideI'm destined to run aground, with her by my sideTogether we'll wake upto a watercolor sunriseShe, she's been running in the rainShe's like whiskey on my brainShe makes me feel so highShe, she's got holes in her stockingsNow she's up and unlocking the door for meAnd I can see the oceanWhen I look into her eyesMy heart is swept away Like a paper boat on the tideI'm destined to run aground, with her by my sideTogether we'll wake up, to a watercolor sunrise.No on really knows where she's from.She comes and she goes like a watercolor bleeds and runs awayWhat am I afraid of? Here she comes....She, she really loves the simple thingsCan't afford no diamond ringsAnd wouldn't wear them if she couldShe, she's got holes in her stockingsNow she's on the front porch rockingThe baby to sleep**How do I say goodbye to what we had? The good times that made us laugh Outweigh the bad. I thought we'd get to see forever But forever's gone away It's so hard to

the man i have to beI'll take a breath, take her by my sideWe stand in awe,We've created lifeWith arms wide openunder the sunlightWelcome to this placeI'll show you everythingWith arms wide opennow everything has changedI'll show you loveI'll show you everythingWith arms wide openIf i had just one wishOnly one demandI hope he's not like meI hope he understandsThat he can take this lifeAnd hold it by the handAnd he can greet the worldWith arms wide open.... **Words and Music written by 7th Generation (Journey's R/L Band)I Gave up...   But I tried...I gave up...   But I tried...I gave up...   But I tried...I gave up...

wakesShe won't be thankful anymoreShe'll never know how much I caredJust that I couldn't stayAnd I'll never know the reasonWhy I always run awayChorus:Burning bridges one by oneWhat I'm doin' can't be undoneAnd I'm always hoping somedayI'm gonna stop this runnin' aroundBut every time the chance comes upAnother bridge goes downLast night we talked of old timesFamilies and home townsShe wondered if we'd both agreeOn where we'd settle downAnd I told her that we'd cross that bridgeWhenever it arrivedNow thorugh the flames I see herStandin' on the other sideRepeat ChorusLike ashes on the waterI drift away in sorrowKnowing that the dayMy lesson's finally learnedI'll be standing at a riverStaring out across tomorrowAnd the bridge I need to get thereWill be a bridge that I have burnedRepeat ChorusAnother bridge goes down**I want to feel that white hot fireBurnin' in my chest I need long cool wet kisses Who'd want to settle for less I don't

Sign of the HammerSong : Thor, the PowerheadBlack clouds on the horizonGreat thunder and burning rainHis chariot pounding,I heard the heavens scream his nameI watched as he shoutedTo the giants

dayGods, Monsters and MenWe'll die together in the endGod of thunder, god of rainEarth shaker who feels no painThe powerhead of the UniverseNow send your never ending curseSwing your hammer

even if romance ran out of rhyme,You would still have my love until the end of time.You're all I need, my love, my valentine.All of my life I have been waiting for all you give to me.You've opened my eyes, and taught me how to love unselfishly.I've dreamed of this a thousand times before, But in my dreams I could not love you more.I will give you my heart until the end of time.You're all I need, my love, my valentine.And even if the sun refused to shine, even if romance ran out of rhyme,You would still have my heart until the end of time,'Cause all I need is you, my
