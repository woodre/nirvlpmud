This command allows you to add an exit from your current room to 
another room in the house.  The first argument is the 'direction' 
(what you type to go there) and the second is the room number to go 
to.  You can only create exits within a house (not to outside of the 
house) with this command. 

Note: use 'north' rather than 'n' to create exits for the cardinal 
directions.  Using 'north' will allow the player to use 'n' or 'north' 
and will show up appropriately in the short and long descriptions. 
Note that room 0 always has the exit to outside the house.
