Allows a player to enter your house.  The target player does not have 
to be logged on for this, it basically just adds them to a list of 
players allowed to enter.  In order to cancel an invitation, use 
[1;37muninvite[1;30m <playername>[1m[2;37;0m.  Note: players that have their permissions set 
to -1 cannot be invited, and even if they have an existing invitation 
(they were invited before their permissions were set to -1) they still 
cannot enter.  Also note that invitations are cleared at reboot.

Syntax:
[1;37minvite[1;30m <playername>[1m[2;37;0m

Example:
invite earwax

[1;30mSee also: uninvite, settings [1m[2;37;0m
