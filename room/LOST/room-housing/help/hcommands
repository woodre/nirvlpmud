This command shows all available commands for a room.  It shows the 
command name, privilege level required, and cost associated for each.  
Note: in case of [1;37mhinfo commands[1m[2;37;0m not showing the same list (this 
shouldn't happen, but one never knows) the [1;37mhcommands[1m[2;37;0m list is always 
the correct one.  It's an automatic listing generated from the actual 
commands, costs and privileges. 

Syntax:
[1;37mhcommands[1;30m
