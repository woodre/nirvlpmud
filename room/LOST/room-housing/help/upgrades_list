Upgrades are features that you can buy for residences.  They range in 
cost and function, although right now they are pretty much limited to 
setting room properties.  See [1;37mhinfo properties[2;37;0m for information about 
how to actually set properties in rooms.  Use the [1;37mupgrades[2;37;0m to list the 
available upgrades and their costs and purchase them.
