This command allows you to set the number of characters that [1;37mset_long[2;37;0m 
and [1;37madd_desc[2;37;0m will linewrap to.  The default is 70.  You must use this 
before setting the description, as it only affects what's run through 
the linewrapping after it's been changed. 

Syntax:
[1;37mset_wrap[1;30m <number of columns>[2;37;0m

Example:
set_wrap 60
