There are six different types of residences that may be built upon 
land.  The size of residence depends of course on the size of the 
land.  See [1;37mhinfo land[2;37;0m for further details.  Beyond the size of land, 
the maximum number of rooms a residence may have is limited by the 
type of building it is.  Larger building types can have more rooms. 

The type of residence one may build on their land is also a factor of 
their level and how much money they have in the bank and are willing 
to spend.  Following are the prices, sizes, and level requirements for 
the various residence types.
