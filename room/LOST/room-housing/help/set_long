This command allows the player to change the long description of 
their current room.  The short description will appear above the long, 
and the long version of the exits list will show after. 

Note: the long description will linewrap automatically, and players 
can set how many columns to wrap it to by using the [1;37m set_wrap[2;37;0m command. 
See [1;37mhinfo set_wrap[2;37;0m for more information. 

Also note: if a player has the color-code converter upgrade, they can 
use color codes in their long description.  See [1;37mhinfo color[2;37;0m and [1;37mhinfo 
color-code converter[2;37;0m and [1;37mhinfo upgrades[2;37;0m for more help. 

Note yet again: using set_long puts you into an editor.  In the 
editor you can use the line-wrap capability by simply typing full 
paragraphs before hitting enter, or you can manually do the spacing.  
It's up to you. 

Syntax:
[1;37mset_long[1;30m
