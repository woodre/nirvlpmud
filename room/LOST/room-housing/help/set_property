With the appropriate upgrade, properties can be set in rooms.  See 
[1;37mhinfo upgrades_list[2;37;0m for the list, but essentially setting a property 
is a two-part process.  First the associated upgrade must be purchased 
(see [1;37mhinfo upgrades[2;37;0m for how to purchase upgrades).  Then, in the room 
the property is desired to be set in, the player uses this command to 
actually set it. 

A couple things to note: properties are viewable using the [1;37mproperties[2;37;0m 
command, and can be unset using the [1;37mremove_property[2;37;0m command.  Also 
note: in addition to the cost of purchasing the upgrades, there is a 
charge each time set_property is used. 

Syntax:
[1;37mset_property [1;30m<property name>[2;37;0m

Example:
set_property safe room property
