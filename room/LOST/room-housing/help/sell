[1;31mRealty Commands[2;37;0m

This command is used to sell land.  The index number is from the [1;37mlist[2;37;0m 
command in realty.  Asking price is the base price that you're asking 
for.  The economy adjustment flag is not in play yet, but still must 
be specified.  What this will allow is for the price to fluctuate with 
the costs of land.  As available land becomes rarer, prices will go 
up, as more land goes on the market, prices will go down.  Use 1 for 
adjusting with the economy, 0 to not.
