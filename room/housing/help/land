The choice of land impacts the type of building that can be built 
upon it.  Small buildings can only be built upon small land, medium 
upon medium size land, and palaces of course can only built upon large 
plots of land.  The type of building also impacts its maximum number 
of rooms. 

Some things to note: land is a permanent investment, barring extended 
periods of inactivity.  See [1;37mhinfo property taxes[2;37;0m for more information.
