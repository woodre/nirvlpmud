Nirvana's housing system allows players to buy land, build a 
residence upon that land, and then customize their residence.  Players 
can set room descriptions, items for people to look at, purchase 
upgrades to allow them to use color codes (see [1;37mhinfo color [2;37;0mand[1;37m hinfo 
color-code converter[2;37;0m), set certain room properties, and do other 
things. 

In order to start down the road towards owning a trailer, house, or 
even a palace, players must save up money.  They can do this in the 
bank.  The next step is to go to a realty and purchase land there.  
Purchasing the right size land is very important, see [1;37mhinfo land[2;37;0m for 
details.  Once they own land, the next step is to visit the land, and 
[1;37mbuild[2;37;0m the appropriate building on it.  See [1;37mhinfo buildings[2;37;0m for more 
information. 

The last step is to customize your residence.  The commands [1;37mhinfo 
commands[2;37;0m and [1;37mhinfo syntax[2;37;0m give descriptions for the various commands. 

Some things to note: land and housing is permanent.  The only way to 
lose land is through long periods of inactivity.  See [1;37mhinfo property 
taxes[2;37;0m for more information.
