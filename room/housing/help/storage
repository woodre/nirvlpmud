This feature isn't in yet.  Hopefully it will be soon, although when 
storage goes in, property taxes do as well.  For general information, 
storage capacity for a residence will be the exact number of rooms in 
the residence.  Players will not be able to have a hotel room (in 
either hotel) and housing-storage at the same time.
