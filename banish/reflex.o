description "stands in the background, shrouded in a black cloak... As you observe him, you get a feeling of dread.  His reputation is that of a dangerous man, but somehow you feel confidant that that is not always the case.  He seems to exude an aura of confidence, but confidence in himself, not others.  Rarely has anyone been known to have gotten close to him, but those that have he would die for."
