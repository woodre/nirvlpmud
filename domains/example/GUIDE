Greetings, dear wizard.

This domain was created to show some examples for coding, especially coding
with the mudlib-features parser, messages, events, properties and some
special things. Nearly every object uses messages.

  You want some examples for the parser?  Have a look at:
    ~Example/obj/flower.c
    ~Example/obj/brush.c
    ~Example/obj/tins.c
    ~Example/room/room1.c
    ~Example/room/meadow.c
    and the whole directory ~Example/parser/

  It would be nice to use reactions on feelings and words:
    ~Example/mon/eumel.c
    ~Example/mon/cat.c

  An example how to use complex/new_door:
    ~Example/room/room1.c
    ~Example/room/room2.c

  And how are these strange events working?:
    ~Example/mon/cat.c

  An example for an object you are able to sit on?:
    ~Example/obj/sofa.c
    ~Example/obj/meadow_obj.c

  An example for a weapon with a special hit function:
    ~Example/obj/loyal_sword.c

  Fine, how can I restrict inherited possibilites:
    ~Example/obj/sorcerer_robe.c + ~Example/obj/sorcerer_clip.c

If you want, you can clone all objects or goto one of the rooms and
test the features.  If you have questions, perhaps I can help you.
Just mail me or ask me when I'm logged in.
